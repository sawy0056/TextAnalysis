The case, McNear v. Trulieve Cannabis Corp. et al., Docket No. 1:19-cv-07289 was filed on December 30, 2019.The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) Trulieve overstated its mark-up on its biological assets; (2) therefore, Trulieve's reported gross profit was inflated; (3) Trulieve engaged in an undisclosed related party real estate sale with Defendant Rivers' husband; and (4) as a result, Defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.On December 17, 2019, during market hours, Grizzly Research published a report (the "Report") explaining that Trulieve had failed to disclose: (1) real estate transactions with insiders; (2) that rather than high-quality indoor production, the vast majority of the Company's marijuana was produced in low quality hoop houses; and (3) the Company's markup on biological assets was excessive and unreasonable.On this news, the Company's stock price fell from $11.91 per share on December 16, 2019 to $10.40 per share on December 17, 2019: a $1.51 or 12.68% drop.The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.
