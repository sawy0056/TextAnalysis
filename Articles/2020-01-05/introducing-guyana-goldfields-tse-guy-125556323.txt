(TSE:GUY) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 24% in the last month. But that is meagre solace in the face of the shocking decline over three years. The share price has sunk like a leaky ship, down 89% in that time. So we're relieved for long term holders to see a bit of uplift. But the more important question is whether the underlying business can justify a higher price still.We really feel for shareholders in this scenario.
