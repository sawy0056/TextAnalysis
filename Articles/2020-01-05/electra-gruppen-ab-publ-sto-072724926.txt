How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.In this case, Electra Gruppen likely looks attractive to investors, given its 6.7% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Electra Gruppen for its dividend - read on to learn more. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Electra Gruppen! OM:ELEC Historical Dividend Yield, January 4th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Electra Gruppen paid out 91% of its profit as dividends. With a payout ratio this high, we'd say its dividend is not well covered by earnings. This may be fine if earnings are growing, but it might not take much of a downturn for the dividend to come under pressure.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Electra Gruppen paid out 118% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. As Electra Gruppen's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Electra Gruppen's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Electra Gruppen's latest financial position,

For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Electra Gruppen's dividend payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was kr3.00 in 2010, compared to kr3.25 last year. Dividend payments have grown at less than 1% a year over this period.Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. In the last five years, Electra Gruppen's earnings per share have shrunk at approximately 9.9% per annum. Declining earnings per share over a number of years is not a great sign for the dividend investor. Without some improvement, this does not bode well for the long term value of a company's dividend.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. We're a bit uncomfortable with Electra Gruppen paying out a high percentage of both its cashflow and earnings. Earnings per share have been falling, and the company has cut its dividend at least once in the past. From a dividend perspective, this is a cause for concern. Using these criteria, Electra Gruppen looks quite suboptimal from a dividend investment perspective.Now, if you want to look closer, it would be worth checking out our free research on Electra Gruppen management tenure, salary, and performance.We have also put together a list of global stocks with a market capitalisation above $1bn and yielding more 3%.
