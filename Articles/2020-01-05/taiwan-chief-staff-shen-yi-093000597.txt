Five other people on board survived.Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking a second term in next week's elections, described the former air force commander as an "outstanding and capable general" who was well loved by his peers.Meanwhile her predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, who appointed Shen to lead Taiwan's air force, said the general was known as one of the military's key talents.Shen played a major role in Taiwan's procurement of fighter jets in the face of threats from Beijing, which has not ruled out the use of force to reunify the island with the Chinese mainland.While Beijing has repeatedly said it "firmly opposes" any arms sales to Taiwan, Shen helped the island reach a major deal with the US to supply it with new fighter jets.In July last year, soon after taking over as chief of the general staff, the US approved the sale of 66 new F-16V fighters " the most advanced version of the plane that forms the backbone of Taiwan's air force.On Friday Tsai urged the Taiwanese armed forces to remain alert to any threats to national security. The president has increased the defence budget since coming to power in 2016 amid a series of PLA "encirclement" exercises and drills in what Beijing has described as a "warning to Taiwan independence separatist forces".Former Taiwan defence minister Andrew Yang Nien-dzu said Shen's contribution to the upgrading of Taiwan's air force was remarkable."He is a very experienced air force officer, and he has strong ability in deployment and planning. Policies have been carried out smoothly under his leadership, especially in the last few years. He put in a lot of effort to facilitate the procurement of the F-16V fighters from the US and was always in close communication with our foreign allies," Yang said.View photosA rescue team searches the helicopter's wreckage.

I think the accident has brought down the morale of troops, and also raises questions of the capability of this kind of helicopter."Sign up now for our 50% early bird offer from SCMP Research: China AI Report.
