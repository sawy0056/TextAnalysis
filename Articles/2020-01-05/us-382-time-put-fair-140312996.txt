The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Fair Isaac’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Fair Isaac Is Fair Isaac still cheap?Fair Isaac appears to be overvalued according to my relative valuation model. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 57.61x is currently well-above the industry average of 45.15x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Fair Isaac’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Fair Isaac?NYSE:FICO Past and Future Earnings, January 4th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.
