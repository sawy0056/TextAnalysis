In addition, Defendants concealed the U.S. Department of Justice’s and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s investigations of Under Armour’s accounting.On Nov. 3, 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating Under Armour to determine whether the company “shifted sales from quarter to quarter to appear healthier.” On this news, the price of Under Armour shares fell sharply.On Nov. 14, 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported (1) former Under Armour executives “said they scrambled to meet aggressive sales targets, borrowing business from future quarters to mask slowing demand in 2016,” (2) the company “frequently leaned on retailers to take products early and redirected goods intended for its factory stores to off-price chains to book sales in the final days of a quarter,” and (3) Federal investigators “are examining emails that show Under Armour’s founder and chief executive, Kevin Plank, knew about efforts to move revenue between quarters, according to a person familiar with the matter.”If you invested in Under Armour between Aug. 3, 2016 and Nov. 1, 2019 (the “Class Period”) and suffered significant losses, you may qualify to be a lead plaintiff – one who selects and oversees the attorneys prosecuting the case.
