(NASDAQ:BMRN) share price up 27% in a single quarter. But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 10% in that half decade.

Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.In the last half decade, BioMarin Pharmaceutical saw its revenue increase by 16% per year. That's better than most loss-making companies. The share price drop of 2.2% per year over five years would be considered let down. So you might argue the BioMarin Pharmaceutical should get more credit for its rather impressive revenue growth over the period. So now is probably an apt time to look closer at the stock, if you think it has potential.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:BMRN Income Statement, January 4th 2020MoreBioMarin Pharmaceutical is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels.
