Key stats included manufacturing PMI numbers on Thursday and German employment figures on Friday.From the manufacturing sector, upward revisions to December PMI numbers out of France, Germany and the Eurozone were positives.A quicker pace of contraction in Italy’s manufacturing sector was negative, however.The devil was in the details for the Eurozone PMI, however, with new orders falling at a quicker pace and employment falling at the fastest pace since records began.On Friday, employment numbers out of Germany also failed to impress, with unemployment rising by 8k. Economists had forecasted a 2k increase…Prelim inflation numbers out of France and Germany had a muted impact, in spite of an uptick in inflationary pressures.The Market MoversFrom the DAX, it was another bearish week for the auto sector.

On Friday, the VIX jumped by 12.4% to deliver the upside in the week.Risk aversion hit the broader markets as investors reacted to U.S military action in the Middle East.Story continuesThe Week AheadIt’s a busy week on the Eurozone economic calendar.
