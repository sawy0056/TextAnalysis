But the prospect of investing money you might not have to spare — without knowing when (or if) you’ll turn a profit — can be terrifying.Although starting a business can be a huge investment, it doesn’t have to be. Whether you’re looking to start a side hustle that can eventually turn into a replacement income or you’re ready to go all-in and build a new business, don’t let a lack of money put your plans on hold. Plenty of business opportunities are out there that you can start for $20 or less. You just need to know where to look.Last updated: Jan. 3, 2020Professional OrganizingCost to start: around $10.95People with a knack for organizing can carve out a living in the professional organization niche. Professional organizers often specialize in one specific area. For example, you could choose to help people organize their closets, kitchens, kids’ bedrooms or garages. Another option — and one that might help you gain clients quicker — is to try your hand at different kinds of organizing services. You could also offer decluttering services for people who aren’t interested in having you create a custom organization system but instead need to get rid of unnecessary items that are taking up space.How To Start Professionally OrganizingReferrals from your network of family and friends can help you pick up professional organization jobs, which you can use to build your business. Social media is another good way to let people know about your services. You can also spring for business cards, which might only set you back $5.95 in shipping charges for a couple hundred cards. Another way to spread the word is to write up and publish a Craigslist service ad for $5. To get your creative juices flowing, Pinterest offers tons of organization ideas.ResellingCost to start: $0With all of the different items available for resale — books, brand-name clothing, home goods, collectibles and more — starting your own business as a reseller is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to branch out on your own. If you are able to resell items locally, you won’t even have to worry about buying shipping materials to pack up the items you sell. Start by finding items around your home to resell. Next, use some of the money you earn to purchase deeply discounted items at retail stores such as Big Lots, Ross, Walmart and Target, and resell those at higher prices for a profit.How To Start ResellingAlthough some sites charge fees to list and sell items on their platforms, including eBay, other options are free to use. LetGo and Facebook Marketplace are a couple of platforms that let you list and resell items free of charge. All you need is a smartphone to take pictures of your items, upload them to the platform and wait for customers to make an offer. Life CoachCost to start: around $18.95If your strong suits are being a good listener, having empathy for others and offering great advice, consider launching a life-coaching business.

Life coaches are not required to be certified and they work mostly online or over the phone.How To Start Life CoachingTo gain clients as a life coach, sign up for an About.me Pro page at $7 per month, which will help you capture leads and book appointments with a connected Google account.

If you need to buy your own cleaning supplies, you’ll have to get basics such as a mop, broom, dustpan and various cleaning solutions. You should be able to get all that for under $20. If you’d rather put money toward business cards or an ad, start out using supplies you already have on hand. When you begin earning money from your cleaning business, you can use that money to buy supplies. Virtual AssistantCost to start: around $5A virtual assistant works from home completing tasks for clients, such as answering emails, booking appointments, ordering supplies and creating presentations.

Advantages of this type of business are that you can set your own hours and pay rate and choose the clients you want to work with.How To Start a Virtual Assistant BusinessAlthough working as a VA does offer quite a bit of flexibility, you might have to take jobs that aren’t ideal at first to get some experience under your belt. Various freelancer sites are available that let you find these types of opportunities.

On average, you can expect to spend around $5 per month on connections, according to Upwork.Resume WriterCost to start: $0If you’re interested in starting an online business, are well-versed in sentence structure and grammar and have experience writing and designing resumes, you might be able to build a business around these talents.

Or, you can travel to students’ homes and charge a bit more for lessons. If you are targeting school-age children as clients, keep in mind that you might only have a limited number of hours per day during the school year, which could make it hard to scale this business.How To Start a Business Teaching MusicBusiness cards are an effective (and cheap) way to promote your business. Put these up around your community, such as at the library, bookstore or music store. To find clients in a hurry, get the word out on your social media channels.
