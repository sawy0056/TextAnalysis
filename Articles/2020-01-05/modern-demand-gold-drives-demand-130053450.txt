Of the market influencers, it seems that trade tensions are at the core, with prolonged and unresolved negotiations undermining business confidence and market sentiment. Gaining significant attention beyond that are heightened concerns regarding further interest rate cuts and the plunge in global bond yields.What we are also hearing now are increasing reports of a recession underpinned by fears that US equity markets are overvalued. In addition, due concern also surrounds Brexit and its implications for the broader EU, the potential impact of political unrest and fiscal volatility in countries across South East Asia and Europe, plus the rise of greater division and instability in the Middle East. Looking specifically at The Perth Mint in terms of current levels of gold demand, this world-leading Mint sold more gold bullion coins in September than any other month this past year. The greatest drivers for this demand were the introduction of the 2020 Australian Bullion Coin Program including the third twelve-year Australian Lunar investor series, combined with the advanced release of its signature Australian Kangaroo gold bullion series.Overall it exports close to USD13 billion each year in precious metal bars and coins.  In addition, as far as its physical gold ETF AAAU is tracking, global gold investment demand is currently biased to the upside so it is a time of acquisition. With AAAU trading for only a little over a year in a rallying market for gold, it is generating an increasing daily average of share buying and investor interest. In August, for example, AAAU reached a milestone of $150 million in net assets, growing to more than $165 million to the year-end 31 October.While individual investors buying gold ETFs represents a much larger flow into gold than that of central banks, it is the buying by central banks that sends an inherent ‘buy now’ signal to the market at large, with astute investors thereby asking, “If central banks are diversifying their monetary reserves, should I be doing the same?”Net buying of gold by central banks has been at the highest level since Richard Nixon abandoned the gold standard in 1971. Led by China, Russia, and Poland, central banks across the globe bought more than 570 tonnes of gold last year. This strong demand continued in the first quarter of this calendar year with total purchases reaching in excess of 180 tonnes - up 116% year-on-year.As the year comes to a close we keep a keen eye on the US political landscape. President Trump’s friendly business policies and tax cuts certainly have taken the edge off any strong impetus to push gold significantly higher than where it is at the moment. If the impeachment proceedings go forward, that will certainly have an effect, but there’s no doubt the President is going to do everything he can to keep the American economy as strong and as buoyant as he can in the lead up to the election next year.This material must be proceeded or accompanied by a prospectus.
