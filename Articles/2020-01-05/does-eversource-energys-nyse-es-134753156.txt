This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at other big companies. After that, we will consider the growth in the business. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. Check out our latest analysis for Eversource Energy How Does Jim Judge's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, Eversource Energy has a market capitalization of US$27b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$15m over the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$1.3m. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations over US$8.0b and the median CEO total compensation was US$11m. (We took a wide range because the CEOs of massive companies tend to be paid similar amounts - even though some are quite a bit bigger than others).It would therefore appear that Eversource Energy pays Jim Judge more than the median CEO remuneration at large companies, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high.
