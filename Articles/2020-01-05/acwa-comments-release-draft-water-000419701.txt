The California Natural Resources Agency, California Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Food and Agriculture developed the draft document to respond to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2019 executive order calling for a portfolio of actions to ensure the state’s long-term water resilience and ecosystem health.“While we’re now reviewing the document in detail, I’m encouraged by what appears to be a comprehensive and collaborative approach to addressing water resilience in California.
