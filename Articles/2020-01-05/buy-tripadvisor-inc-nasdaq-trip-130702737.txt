(NASDAQ:TRIP)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 4, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosTripAdvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP), which is in the interactive media and services business, and is based in United States, saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$41.20 and falling to the lows of US$27.91. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether TripAdvisor's current trading price of US$30.17 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at TripAdvisor’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for TripAdvisor What is TripAdvisor worth?Great news for investors – TripAdvisor is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $40.49, but it is currently trading at US$30.17 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that TripAdvisor’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from TripAdvisor?NasdaqGS:TRIP Past and Future Earnings, January 4th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 59% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for TripAdvisor. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? Since TRIP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor?
