Like Mester, Barkin had been skeptical of last year's rate cuts. "I'm encouraged by recent jobs reports and the pace of holiday spending," with last year's round of three Fed rate cuts helping prop up demand for homes, cars and other big-ticket consumer items, Barkin added.It was an assessment also shared by Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans who unlike Barkin and Mester supported last year's interest-rate cuts. In a CNBC interview, Evans predicted U.S. economic growth this year would chug along at a rate of 2% to 2.25%, roughly the pace of expansion in the second half of last year.The clutch of comments on Friday shows how comfortable most Fed policymakers are that the 2019 rate cuts will prove a sufficient buffer against the risks that spurred them into providing the stimulus, including slowing global growth and escalating trade tensions.Indeed, after a fractious year for the Fed, which saw split votes on each of the rate cuts, officials agreed unanimously in their final policy meeting of 2019 to leave rates unchanged. Moreover, they agreed rates were likely to stay on hold for "a time" as long as the economy remains on track, minutes of the Dec. 10-11 meeting released on Friday showed."Participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate," according to the minutes.STILL SOME SIMMERING DIVISIONSEven with their newfound consensus over the outlook for rates and the economy, there were some signs of tensions that could divide Fed policymakers as the year progresses.Inflation has been running below the Fed's 2% target, and that is worrying some policymakers including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly."We are seeing some early evidence that long run inflation expectations are slipping," Daly said at the annual American Economics Association meeting in San Diego. "We don't have a really good understanding of why it's been so difficult to get inflation back up.Speaking at the same panel, Dallas Fed bank chief Robert Kaplan downplayed the danger of low inflation, noting that it is only a few tenths of a percentage point below the Fed's target. At the same time he noted his worry that low rates could feed excesses in the financial system.Mester, in her interview, took a similar stance. "I don't see anything right now that suggests to me inflation is going to run away on the top side," she said. "I don't see it running too low either."(Additional reporting by Jason Lange in Washington; Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider in San Diego, and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Writing by Dan Burns, Howard Schneider, Ann Saphir; Editing by Andrea Ricci, Paul Simao and Sandra Maler)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDollar stumbles as coronavirus ramps up Fed cut betsReutersWorld stocks set for worst week since 2008 as virus fears grip marketsReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
