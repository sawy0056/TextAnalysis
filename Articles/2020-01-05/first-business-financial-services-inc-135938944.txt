our latest analysis on First Business Financial Services's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend.

First Business Financial Services has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.14 in 2010, compared to US$0.60 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 16% per year over this time.Dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend.
