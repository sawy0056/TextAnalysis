This is the third time in 3 months that Australia has declared a state of emergency. Wind is expected to get stronger over the next couple of days – expecting a very dangerous weekend – with Saturday being the worst of it. Erickson crews have been deployed in Australia experiencing first-hand the complexity of these fires. "What keeps us going is the support and thanks of the rural communities of Australia. Every day people come to look at the Air Crane and thank us for our efforts and commitment to fighting the fires alongside what can only be called the best fire service in the world, the Australian Volunteer Fire Service." – Erickson Crew, Australia With Erickson's rotary-wing aircraft, they're able to quickly access austere and remote areas of Australia to strategically battle the blaze.
