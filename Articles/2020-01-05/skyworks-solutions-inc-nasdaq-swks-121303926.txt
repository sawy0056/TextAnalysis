With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS).Over the last twelve months Skyworks Solutions has recorded a ROE of 21%. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each $1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made $0.21 in profit. See our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Skyworks Solutions:21% = US$854m ÷ US$4.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does ROE Mean?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. A higher profit will lead to a higher ROE. So, all else being equal, a high ROE is better than a low one. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does Skyworks Solutions Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Skyworks Solutions has a higher ROE than the average (9.9%) in the Semiconductor industry.NasdaqGS:SWKS Past Revenue and Net Income, January 4th 2020MoreThat is a good sign. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. One data point to check is if insiders have bought shares recently.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining Skyworks Solutions's Debt And Its 21% Return On EquityShareholders will be pleased to learn that Skyworks Solutions has not one iota of net debt! Its ROE suggests it is a decent business; and the fact it is not leveraging returns indicates it is well worth watching. At the end of the day, when a company has zero debt, it is in a better position to take future growth opportunities.In SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Story continuesHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Skyworks Solutions may not be the best stock to buy.
