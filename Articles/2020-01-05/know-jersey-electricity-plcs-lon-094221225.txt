To keep it practical, we'll show how Jersey Electricity plc's (LON:JEL) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Jersey Electricity has a P/E ratio of 11.58. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 8.6%. Check out our latest analysis for Jersey Electricity How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Jersey Electricity:P/E of 11.58 = £4.45 ÷ £0.38 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each £1 of company earnings. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does Jersey Electricity Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Jersey Electricity has a lower P/E than the average (13.3) in the electric utilities industry classification.LSE:JEL Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 4th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Jersey Electricity shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Since the market seems unimpressed with Jersey Electricity, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Jersey Electricity's earnings per share fell by 2.8% in the last twelve months. But EPS is up 19% over the last 5 years.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does Jersey Electricity's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Jersey Electricity has net debt worth just 3.9% of its market capitalization. So it doesn't have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.The Verdict On Jersey Electricity's P/E RatioJersey Electricity has a P/E of 11.6. That's below the average in the GB market, which is 18.3. With only modest debt, it's likely the lack of EPS growth at least partially explains the pessimism implied by the P/E ratio.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. So this free visual report on analyst forecasts could hold the key to an excellent investment decision.Story continuesBut note: Jersey Electricity may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20).If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
