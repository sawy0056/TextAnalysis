(CVE:MDP) Expected To BreakevenSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 4, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosMedexus Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (CVE:MDP): Medexus Pharmaceuticals Inc. operates as a specialty pharmaceutical company in Canada. The CA$53m market-cap company’s loss lessens since it announced a -CA$6.5m bottom-line in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of -CA$3.7m, as it approaches breakeven. As path to profitability is the topic on MDP’s investors mind, I’ve decided to gauge market sentiment. In this article, I will touch on the expectations for MDP’s growth and when analysts expect the company to become profitable. View our latest analysis for Medexus Pharmaceuticals According to the 3 industry analysts covering MDP, the consensus is breakeven is near. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2021, before generating positive profits of CA$6.5m in 2022. So, MDP is predicted to breakeven approximately 2 years from today. How fast will MDP have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2022? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 92% year-on-year, on average, which is rather optimistic! Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.TSXV:MDP Past and Future Earnings, January 4th 2020MoreGiven this is a high-level overview, I won’t go into details of MDP’s upcoming projects, but, bear in mind that by and large pharmaceuticals, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means that a high growth rate is not unusual, especially if the company is currently in an investment period.Before I wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning. MDP currently has a relatively high level of debt. Generally, the rule of thumb is debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in MDP’s case is 70%. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Next Steps:There are key fundamentals of MDP which are not covered in this article, but I must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.
