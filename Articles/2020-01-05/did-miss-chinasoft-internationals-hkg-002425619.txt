Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Chinasoft International Limited (HKG:354) share price is up 97% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 2.0% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 32% in the last year , including dividends . View our latest analysis for Chinasoft International In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Chinasoft International achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 25% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:354 Past and Future Earnings, January 4th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Chinasoft International's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Chinasoft International the TSR over the last 5 years was 99%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Chinasoft International shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 15% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
