Biden riffing on how Obama put him in charge of judging the "jobs of the future" suggests re-training miners as coders."Anybody who can go down 3000 feet in a mine can sure as hell learn to program as well."This sort of "just transition" stuff was murder on Clinton in 2016... — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) December 30, 2019 Biden’s comments come at a moment when natural gas has taken a good share of the market previously dominated by coal and when coal generation continues to go down. At the same time, coal exports from the US to Asia and Europe are experiencing a series of roadblocks imposed by towns and cities that decided to put limits on how much of the fossil fuel is shipped from their ports. Related: Are Oil Stocks ‘Too Toxic To Trade’The former vice president’s remarks were not entirely well-received, even within his own party. Brianna Wu, candidate for the House of Representatives in MA District 8 and a software engineer, tweeted that Biden’s comment seems to be tone-deaf to the needs of mineworkers who have lost their jobs.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 53,300 people were employed in coal mines in September 2019, far below the 79,400 people employed in the sector a decade ago. It’s not the first time Biden has made comments that call into question his connection to the realities of unemployed Americans.Following a presidential debate on December 19, the Washington Examiner published an op-ed titled “Is Joe Biden trying to lose the Rust Belt?” This, after the Democratic candidate did not elaborate on how, if elected, his government would provide opportunities to blue-collar energy and mine workers to transition to well-paying jobs as the US is pushed to move toward a green economy.By Mining.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Prospect Of War Pushes Oil To Seven Month HighOil Soars Following U.S. Killing Of Iran’s Top GeneralIs This The Future Of Solar?Read this article on OilPrice.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIowa Recount Confirms Buttigieg Caucus Win: Campaign UpdateBloombergDonald Trump Goes Off On Comcast At Cabinet Room Meeting: “They’re The Racists”DeadlineJoe Biden's campaign isn't dead yetPoliticoCan Biden Recover in South Carolina?The Wall Street JournalHow the Democratic nominating battle could end in a messy 'brokered convention'ReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
