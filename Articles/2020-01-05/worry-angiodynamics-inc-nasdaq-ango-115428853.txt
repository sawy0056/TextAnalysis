We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at US$687k. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. We examined companies with market caps from US$400m to US$1.6b, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was US$2.5m.So Jim Clemmer receives a similar amount to the median CEO pay, amongst the companies we looked at.
