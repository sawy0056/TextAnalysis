But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. That's what has happened with the Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) share price.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Ralph Lauren's TSR for the last 3 years was 43%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveRalph Lauren provided a TSR of 16% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. But at least that's still a gain! Over five years the TSR has been a reduction of 5.7% per year, over five years.
