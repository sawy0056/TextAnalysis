This included gains from federal income tax credits. The year-over-year rise in the bottom line can be attributable to improved sales and margins.Net sales of this cosmetics retailer grew 7.9% year over year to $1,682.5 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,692 million. Comps (including stores and e-commerce) climbed 3.2%, compared with 7.8% growth recorded in the prior-year quarter and 6.2% in the preceding quarter.

Also, fixed-store expense leverage aided the gross margin.

Pre-opening expenses grew 14.5% to $6.5 million.Other FinancialsUlta Beauty ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $208.8 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $1,847.2 million.
