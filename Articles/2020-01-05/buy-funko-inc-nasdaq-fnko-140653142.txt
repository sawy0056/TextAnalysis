(NASDAQ:FNKO)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 4, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosFunko, Inc. (NASDAQ:FNKO), which is in the retail distributors business, and is based in United States, led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Funko’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Funko What's the opportunity in Funko?According to my relative valuation model, the stock seems to be currently fairly priced. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 20.71x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 19.06x, which means if you buy Funko today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe Funko should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Funko’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Funko look like?NasdaqGS:FNKO Past and Future Earnings, January 4th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Funko. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in FNKO’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at FNKO? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FNKO, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.
