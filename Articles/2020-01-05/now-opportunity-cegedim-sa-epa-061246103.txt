As a small cap stock, hardly covered by any analysts, there is generally more of an opportunity for mispricing as there is less activity to push the stock closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity here to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Cegedim’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Cegedim What is Cegedim worth?Good news, investors! Cegedim is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is €46.78, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Cegedim’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Cegedim?ENXTPA:CGM Past and Future Earnings, January 4th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted revenue growth of 8.8% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Cegedim, at least in the short term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since CGM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock.
