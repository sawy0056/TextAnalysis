For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed. Nonetheless, only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.So should DevEx Resources (ASX:DEV) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. Check out our latest analysis for DevEx Resources Does DevEx Resources Have A Long Cash Runway?A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. As at June 2019, DevEx Resources had cash of AU$1.2m and no debt. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through AU$1.7m. Therefore, from June 2019 it had roughly 8 months of cash runway. To be frank, this kind of short runway puts us on edge, as it indicates the company must reduce its cash burn significantly, or else raise cash imminently. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.ASX:DEV Historical Debt, January 4th 2020MoreHow Is DevEx Resources's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Because DevEx Resources isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. Over the last year its cash burn actually increased by 7.5%, which suggests that management are increasing investment in future growth, but not too quickly. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but investors should be mindful of the fact that will shorten the cash runway. Admittedly, we're a bit cautious of DevEx Resources due to its lack of significant operating revenues. So we'd generally prefer stocks from this list of stocks that have analysts forecasting growth.Can DevEx Resources Raise More Cash Easily?Since its cash burn is increasing (albeit only slightly), DevEx Resources shareholders should still be mindful of the possibility it will require more cash in the future.

By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).DevEx Resources's cash burn of AU$1.7m is about 13% of its AU$14m market capitalisation. Given that situation, it's fair to say the company wouldn't have much trouble raising more cash for growth, but shareholders would be somewhat diluted.How Risky Is DevEx Resources's Cash Burn Situation?Even though its cash runway makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought DevEx Resources's cash burn relative to its market cap was relatively promising.
