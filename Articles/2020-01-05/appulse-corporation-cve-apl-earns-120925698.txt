Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Appulse:0.13 = CA$649k ÷ (CA$9.9m - CA$4.7m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Appulse has an ROCE of 13%.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. How cyclical is Appulse? You can see for yourself by looking at this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.Appulse's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCEShort term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months.

As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 48% of its total assets.
