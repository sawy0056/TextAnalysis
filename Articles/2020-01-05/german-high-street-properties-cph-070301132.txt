But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the German High Street Properties A/S (CPH:GERHSP) share price has soared 127% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 12% over the last quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 11% in the last three months. Check out our latest analysis for German High Street Properties While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.German High Street Properties's earnings per share are down 5.8% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The revenue reduction of 1.0% per year is not a positive. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).CPSE:GERHSP Income Statement, January 4th 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at German High Street Properties's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveGerman High Street Properties shareholders gained a total return of 19% during the year.
