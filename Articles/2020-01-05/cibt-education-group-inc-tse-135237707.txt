Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for CIBT Education Group:0.012 = CA$3.8m ÷ (CA$390m - CA$82m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2019.)Therefore, CIBT Education Group has an ROCE of 1.2%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Do CIBT Education Group's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Liabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.CIBT Education Group has total assets of CA$390m and current liabilities of CA$82m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 21% of its total assets. This is not a high level of current liabilities, which would not boost the ROCE by much.Story continuesOur Take On CIBT Education Group's ROCECIBT Education Group has a poor ROCE, and there may be better investment prospects out there.
