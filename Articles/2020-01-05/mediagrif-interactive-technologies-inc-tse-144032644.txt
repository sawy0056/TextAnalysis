How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.In this case, Mediagrif Interactive Technologies likely looks attractive to investors, given its 5.7% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis TSX:MDF Historical Dividend Yield, January 4th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. While Mediagrif Interactive Technologies pays a dividend, it reported a loss over the last year. When a company is loss-making, we next need to check to see if its cash flows can support the dividend.Mediagrif Interactive Technologies paid out 124% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow.With a strong net cash balance, Mediagrif Interactive Technologies investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.We update our data on Mediagrif Interactive Technologies every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Mediagrif Interactive Technologies's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was CA$0.20 in 2010, compared to CA$0.40 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.2% a year over that time.Companies like this, growing their dividend at a decent rate, can be very valuable over the long term, if the rate of growth can be maintained.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Over the past five years, it looks as though Mediagrif Interactive Technologies's EPS have declined at around 45% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective, as even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. We're a bit uncomfortable with Mediagrif Interactive Technologies paying a dividend while loss-making, especially since the dividend was also not well covered by free cash flow. Second, earnings per share have actually shrunk, but at least the dividends have been relatively stable. Using these criteria, Mediagrif Interactive Technologies looks quite suboptimal from a dividend investment perspective.Story continuesGiven that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive.
