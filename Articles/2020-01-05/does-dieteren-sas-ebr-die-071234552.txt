We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to D'Ieteren SA's (EBR:DIE), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. D'Ieteren has a price to earnings ratio of 55.13, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 1.8%. View our latest analysis for D'Ieteren How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for D'Ieteren:P/E of 55.13 = €61.10 ÷ €1.11 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each €1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does D'Ieteren Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that D'Ieteren has a significantly higher P/E than the average (13.0) P/E for companies in the retail distributors industry.ENXTBR:DIE Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 4th 2020MoreD'Ieteren's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.D'Ieteren saw earnings per share decrease by 35% last year. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 9.6% per year over the last five years. This growth rate might warrant a below average P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting D'Ieteren's P/E?With net cash of €711m, D'Ieteren has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 22% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On D'Ieteren's P/E RatioWith a P/E ratio of 55.1, D'Ieteren is expected to grow earnings very strongly in the years to come. The recent drop in earnings per share would make some investors cautious, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
