(NASDAQ:DGLY) since 2005. First, this article will compare CEO compensation with compensation at similar sized companies. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally - as a second measure of performance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. Check out our latest analysis for Digital Ally How Does Stan Ross's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, Digital Ally, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$13m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$1.1m over the year to December 2018. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the salary is lower, valued at US$250k. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We examined a group of similar sized companies, with market capitalizations of below US$200m. The median CEO total compensation in that group is US$526k.It would therefore appear that Digital Ally, Inc. pays Stan Ross more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. A closer look at the performance of the underlying business will give us a better idea about whether the pay is particularly generous.You can see, below, how CEO compensation at Digital Ally has changed over time.NasdaqCM:DGLY CEO Compensation, January 4th 2020MoreIs Digital Ally, Inc.
