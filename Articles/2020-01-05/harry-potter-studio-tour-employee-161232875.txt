"They reported him after growing suspicious of the items constantly piling up under his desk."The Harry Potter films, based on author J.K. Rowling's popular books, have garnered some $9.2 billion in ticket sales, according to data from Forbes and Box Office Mojo, and demand for themed merchandise has been intense.An investigation found that Hill first packaged and delivered the stolen items to buyers on eBay through his local post office but later started sending the goods through his work post office.
