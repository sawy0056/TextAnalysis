So as you can imagine, the fact that Shenzhou International Group Holdings insiders own a significant number of shares certainly appeals to me. Actually, with 47% of the company to their names, insiders are profoundly invested in the business. I'm always comforted by solid insider ownership like this, as it implies that those running the business are genuinely motivated to create shareholder value. And their holding is extremely valuable at the current share price, totalling CN¥80b. Now that's what I call some serious skin in the game!It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Shenzhou International Group Holdings, with market caps over CN¥56b, is about CN¥6.5m.The CEO of Shenzhou International Group Holdings only received CN¥1.4m in total compensation for the year ending December 2018. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance, that arrangement seems generous to shareholders, and points to a modest remuneration culture. While the level of CEO compensation isn't a huge factor in my view of the company, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Story continuesShould You Add Shenzhou International Group Holdings To Your Watchlist?Given my belief that share price follows earnings per share you can easily imagine how I feel about Shenzhou International Group Holdings's strong EPS growth.
