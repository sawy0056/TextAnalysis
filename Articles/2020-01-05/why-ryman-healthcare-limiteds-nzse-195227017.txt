See our latest analysis for Ryman Healthcare How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Ryman Healthcare:P/E of 24.64 = NZ$16.99 ÷ NZ$0.69 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does Ryman Healthcare Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio.

I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Ryman Healthcare saw earnings per share decrease by 2.9% last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 9.0% per year over the last five years. And EPS is down 1.4% a year, over the last 3 years. So you wouldn't expect a very high P/E.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting Ryman Healthcare's P/E?Ryman Healthcare has net debt worth 18% of its market capitalization. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.The Bottom Line On Ryman Healthcare's P/E RatioRyman Healthcare has a P/E of 24.6. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 19.4. With modest debt but no EPS growth in the last year, it's fair to say the P/E implies some optimism about future earnings, from the market.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
