Small supplies of specialty bath products cost so much that she didn't know what to do. A chemist friend suggested she make her own soaps."Who does that nowadays?" Rice said she asked, noting that her training as a manufacturing systems engineer at Ford Motor has nothing to do with soapmaking.Rice, 42, of Troy went to the public library to find books and figure it out.First, she launched an online business in summer 2016, then this winter, she opened a Green Olive Soap brick-and-mortar shop featuring luxury organic and vegan skin care in Troy. The body butters Rice developed to combat dry winter skin have been an especially strong seller this season.Customer orders are filled after her day job. Nothing conflicts with her career as an engineer."I have quite a few customers at Ford, but when I'm on Ford's time, I don't talk about my soap business. I don't. I'm an engineer. I'm a very specific personality," Rice said. "But if it's my lunch break, and if I have orders, I'll hand them out off campus."20/20 vision in 2020: Name and claim small business successIs it possible to retire by age 45?: Here's what you'll have to doView photosCamilla Rice designs soap in Troy, Mich.MoreWatching son Miles, 5, and to a lesser extent, daughter Selah, 12, inspired Rice to take action. People in different parts of Michigan and as far away as Florida and California look to Rice for homemade natural bath supplies. Word of mouth has grown the business, and strong support comes from within the engineering family at Ford and General Motors. "She's putting her best foot forward, trying to help others with skin issues ... I think it's a blessing in her life," said Edna Martinez, 33, of Detroit, a systems integration engineer at Ford who used to work with Rice on transmissions. Martinez and her brother and sister and niece all purchase from Rice.View photosCheryl and Dick Miller of Lincoln Park say they love the aroma of peppermint soap made by Camilla Rice, owner of Olive Garden Soaps in Troy. "I like that they're organic and made without harsh chemicals," Cheryl said.MoreCheryl Miller, 55, of Lincoln Park said she discovered Green Olive Soaps from a post on Facebook, and she is a repeat customer. "I like to take nice bubble baths, and her soaps are so soft and smell good and look pretty. I love anything peppermint and bought peppermint soap. Then lavender, raspberry vanilla, coconut. When you store these under the cabinet, they smell pretty without even using them."Dick Miller, 60, an automotive service adviser, asked his wife to explore options for him."My husband asked me to find out about men's soap and said, 'Can you order me any?' And my niece is allergic to different detergents. Until now, I always just used Oil of Olay and other regular soaps," Cheryl Miller said. Customers said Rice personally responds to email and texts with helpful advice and words of encouragement and sends sample gifts.She makes everything in her home studio, usually on Saturday nights. Her shop is open on Fridays and Saturdays and by appointment the rest of the week. Total sales since she began are inching toward six figures. Rice is the only full-time employee and hires help when needed. The graduate of what is now Kettering University never could have imagined this turn of events. She has no plans to leave the engineering job she loves. Story continues"My son's eczema was the primary reason I started making soap,"s he said. "As a baby, his eczema was very viral. … My friend ended up buying me my first soapmaking kit. And I fell in love with it."The majority of her clients have skin conditions, but many are everyday people who appreciate handmade products or supporting a woman on her own who is supporting kids and following a dream. Green Olive Soaps does not use palm or almond oil or any nut ingredients, since Rice's kids have peanut allergies. Having referrals from doctors in Troy is an honor, she said. "People with eczema have very dry skin where they scratch on a continuous basis, which can damage their skin and cause skin breakage, which can lead to infections," she said. Her experience at home allowed her to better understand challenges faced by customers. "I get a lot of customers with children with eczema. My son would just cry. I have a customer whose uncle is an older gentleman and has skin conditions, and I'm coming up with a totally different blend to help him."Friends old and new have pulled together to support this little soap company.Chrystal Holmes, 47, of Highland Park attended Highland Park Community High School with Rice and went on to be an executive assistant at GM. Holmes is an established interior designer recruited to design the new store in Troy."This is not about mass production or something coming from any manufacturer," Holmes said. "The scents have a relaxing quality, different than any other. It's nothing overpowering, just inviting. And it warms you. Camilla makes these soaps in her home and shows so much love with each one."Contact Phoebe Wall Howard at 313-222-6512 or phoward@freepress.com. Follow her on Twitter @phoebesaid.
