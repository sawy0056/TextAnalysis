But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the JLT Mobile Computers AB (publ) (STO:JLT) share price has soared 244% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. The last week saw the share price soften some 1.7%. See our latest analysis for JLT Mobile Computers There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, JLT Mobile Computers managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 28% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).OM:JLT Past and Future Earnings, January 4th 2020MoreWe know that JLT Mobile Computers has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of JLT Mobile Computers, it has a TSR of 300% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that JLT Mobile Computers has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 88% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 32% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
