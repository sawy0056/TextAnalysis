For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Minesto (STO:MINEST) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. Check out our latest analysis for Minesto How Long Is Minesto's Cash Runway?A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. Minesto has such a small amount of debt that we'll set it aside, and focus on the kr30m in cash it held at June 2019. In the last year, its cash burn was kr45m. That means it had a cash runway of around 8 months as of June 2019. To be frank, this kind of short runway puts us on edge, as it indicates the company must reduce its cash burn significantly, or else raise cash imminently. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.OM:MINEST Historical Debt, January 4th 2020MoreHow Well Is Minesto Growing?Minesto managed to reduce its cash burn by 58% over the last twelve months, which suggests it's on the right flight path. And it could also show revenue growth of 13% in the same period. It seems to be growing nicely. In reality, this article only makes a short study of the company's growth data. This graph of historic earnings and revenue shows how Minesto is building its business over time.How Easily Can Minesto Raise Cash?Even though it seems like Minesto is developing its business nicely, we still like to consider how easily it could raise more money to accelerate growth. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash to fund growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.Since it has a market capitalisation of kr1.8b, Minesto's kr45m in cash burn equates to about 2.5% of its market value. So it could almost certainly just borrow a little to fund another year's growth, or else easily raise the cash by issuing a few shares.How Risky Is Minesto's Cash Burn Situation?Even though its cash runway makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought Minesto's cash burn relative to its market cap was relatively promising. While we're the kind of investors who are always a bit concerned about the risks involved with cash burning companies, the metrics we have discussed in this article leave us relatively comfortable about Minesto's situation. For us, it's always important to consider risks around cash burn rates. But investors should look at a whole range of factors when researching a new stock.
