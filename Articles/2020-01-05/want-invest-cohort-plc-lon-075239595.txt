Check out our latest analysis for Cohort How CHRT fared against its long-term earnings performance and its industryCHRT's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 31 October 2019) of UK£7.3m has jumped 23% compared to the previous year.Furthermore, this one-year growth rate has exceeded its 5-year annual growth average of 2.7%, indicating the rate at which CHRT is growing has accelerated. What's the driver of this growth? Well, let’s take a look at whether it is solely attributable to industry tailwinds, or if Cohort has seen some company-specific growth.AIM:CHRT Income Statement, January 4th 2020MoreIn terms of returns from investment, Cohort has fallen short of achieving a 20% return on equity (ROE), recording 9.2% instead. Furthermore, its return on assets (ROA) of 5.2% is below the GB Aerospace & Defense industry of 5.6%, indicating Cohort's are utilized less efficiently.
