is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Canadian Western Bank:P/E of 10.44 = CA$31.84 ÷ CA$3.05 (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Canadian Western Bank Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio.

That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Canadian Western Bank increased earnings per share by 8.7% last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 3.5% per year over the last five years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.How Does Canadian Western Bank's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?The extra options and safety that comes with Canadian Western Bank's CA$47m net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.The Bottom Line On Canadian Western Bank's P/E RatioCanadian Western Bank has a P/E of 10.4. That's below the average in the CA market, which is 15.8. Recent earnings growth wasn't bad. And the net cash position gives the company many options. So it's strange that the low P/E indicates low expectations.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
