It allows us to reflect on whether or not the company has met or exceed expectations, which is a great indicator for future performance. Today I will assess HFD's latest performance announced on 27 September 2019 and compare these figures to its longer term trend and industry movements. View our latest analysis for Halfords Group Was HFD's recent earnings decline worse than the long-term trend and the industry?HFD's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 27 September 2019) of UK£41m has declined by -14% compared to the previous year.Furthermore, this one-year growth rate has been lower than its average earnings growth rate over the past 5 years of -8.8%, indicating the rate at which HFD is growing has slowed down. Why could this be happening? Let's examine what's going on with margins and whether the rest of the industry is feeling the heat.LSE:HFD Income Statement, January 4th 2020MoreIn terms of returns from investment, Halfords Group has fallen short of achieving a 20% return on equity (ROE), recording 11% instead. However, its return on assets (ROA) of 4.4% exceeds the GB Specialty Retail industry of 3.4%, indicating Halfords Group has used its assets more efficiently. Though, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for Halfords Group’s debt level, has declined over the past 3 years from 15% to 8.6%.What does this mean?While past data is useful, it doesn’t tell the whole story. In some cases, companies that experience a drawn out period of reduction in earnings are going through some sort of reinvestment phase Although, if the entire industry is struggling to grow over time, it may be a indicator of a structural shift, which makes Halfords Group and its peers a riskier investment.
