This was the second straight quarter when the company’s bottom-line surpassed the consensus mark. However, the top line fell short of the consensus estimate for the fourth successive quarter. Moreover, both net sales and earnings per share decreased year over year. Also, margins remained under pressure.Nonetheless, Tiffany retained fiscal 2019 view and added that it is trying all means to position itself amid headwinds related to sluggish demand from foreign tourists, adverse currency fluctuations and disruptions in Hong Kong.Tiffany remains focused on evolving its brand, enhancing omni-channel experience, solidifying position in core markets and augmenting operating model efficiency. The company remains committed to elevating in-store experience and replenishing product portfolio.Q2 HighlightsThe company reported quarterly earnings of $1.12 per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 but fell roughly 4% from the year-ago period. Lower operating margins and higher effective tax rate hurt the bottom line. However, decline in SG&A expenses and share repurchase activity provided some cushion.Net sales came in at $1,048.5 million, down 3% from $1,075.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The reported figure came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,067.5 million. Also, the company’s comparable sales (comps) declined 4%.

Sales in Europe came in at $116 million, down 4%, while comps fell 6%. Other net sales were unchanged at $25 million, whereas comps plunged 29%.Gross margin contracted 130 basis points to 62.7% in the quarter under review on account of changes in sales mix toward higher price point jewelry. Operating margin shrunk 20 basis points to 16%. For fiscal 2019, management expects operating margin to be equal to the year-ago level.SG&A expenses declined 5% to $473.4 million during the quarter primarily due to lower marketing spending and fall in labor and incentive compensation costs. This was partly offset by higher store occupancy and depreciation charges.Store UpdateDuring the first half of fiscal 2019, this designer and retailer of fine jewelry opened three company-operated stores and shuttered two locations. As of July 31, 2019, the company operated 322 stores (124 in the Americas, 90 in Asia-Pacific, 56 in Japan, 47 in Europe, and five in the UAE).
