Today I will take you through a basic sense check to gain perspective on how AAR is doing by evaluating its latest earnings with its longer term trend as well as its industry peers' performance over the same period. Check out our latest analysis for AAR Could AIR beat the long-term trend and outperform its industry?AIR's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 30 November 2019) of US$91m has jumped 15% compared to the previous year.However, this one-year growth rate has been lower than its average earnings growth rate over the past 5 years of 39%, indicating the rate at which AIR is growing has slowed down. To understand what's happening, let’s take a look at what’s transpiring with margins and if the whole industry is experiencing the hit as well.NYSE:AIR Income Statement, January 4th 2020MoreIn terms of returns from investment, AAR has fallen short of achieving a 20% return on equity (ROE), recording 9.9% instead. Furthermore, its return on assets (ROA) of 5.6% is below the US Aerospace & Defense industry of 6.7%, indicating AAR's are utilized less efficiently. However, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for AAR’s debt level, has increased over the past 3 years from 6.2% to 9.3%. This correlates with a decrease in debt holding, with debt-to-equity ratio declining from 64% to 21% over the past 5 years.What does this mean?While past data is useful, it doesn’t tell the whole story. While AAR has a good historical track record with positive growth and profitability, there's no certainty that this will extrapolate into the future.
