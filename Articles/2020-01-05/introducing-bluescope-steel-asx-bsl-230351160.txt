But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of BlueScope Steel Limited (ASX:BSL) stock is up an impressive 168% over the last five years. It's also good to see the share price up 29% over the last quarter. See our latest analysis for BlueScope Steel To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the last half decade, BlueScope Steel became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. We can see that the BlueScope Steel share price is up 57% in the last three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 25% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 16% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. So you might conclude the market is a little more cautious about the stock, these days. This unenthusiastic sentiment is reflected in the stock's reasonably modest P/E ratio of 7.86.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).ASX:BSL Past and Future Earnings, January 4th 2020MoreIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on BlueScope Steel's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, BlueScope Steel's TSR for the last 5 years was 181%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that BlueScope Steel shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 34% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 23% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
