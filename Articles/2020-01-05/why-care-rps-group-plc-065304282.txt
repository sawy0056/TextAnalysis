Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for RPS Group:0.067 = UK£37m ÷ (UK£677m - UK£126m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, RPS Group has an ROCE of 6.7%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts.
