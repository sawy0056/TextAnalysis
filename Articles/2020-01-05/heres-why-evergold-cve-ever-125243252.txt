For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.So should Evergold (CVE:EVER) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. Check out our latest analysis for Evergold Does Evergold Have A Long Cash Runway?A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. When Evergold last reported its balance sheet in September 2019, it had zero debt and cash worth CA$3.5k. Importantly, its cash burn was CA$318k over the trailing twelve months. That means it had a cash runway of under two months as of September 2019. It's extremely surprising to us that the company has allowed its cash runway to get that short! You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.TSXV:EVER Historical Debt, January 4th 2020MoreHow Is Evergold's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Evergold didn't record any revenue over the last year, indicating that it's an early stage company still developing its business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. Its cash burn positively exploded in the last year, up 283%. With that kind of spending growth its cash runway will shorten quickly, as it simultaneously uses its cash while increasing the burn rate. Evergold makes us a little nervous due to its lack of substantial operating revenue. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.How Easily Can Evergold Raise Cash?Given its cash burn trajectory, Evergold shareholders should already be thinking about how easy it might be for it to raise further cash in the future. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.Evergold's cash burn of CA$318k is about 3.8% of its CA$8.3m market capitalisation. Given that is a rather small percentage, it would probably be really easy for the company to fund another year's growth by issuing some new shares to investors, or even by taking out a loan.So, Should We Worry About Evergold's Cash Burn?On this analysis of Evergold's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its cash runway has us a bit worried. Considering all the measures mentioned in this report, we reckon that its cash burn is fairly risky, and if we held shares we'd be watching like a hawk for any deterioration.
