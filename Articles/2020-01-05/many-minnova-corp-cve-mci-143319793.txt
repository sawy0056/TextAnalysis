(CVE:MCI) Shares Did Insiders Buy, In The Last Year?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 4, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosWe've lost count of how many times insiders have accumulated shares in a company that goes on to improve markedly. The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Minnova Corp. (CVE:MCI).What Is Insider Selling?It is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year. Check out our latest analysis for Minnova Minnova Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman Gorden Glenn for CA$242k worth of shares, at about CA$0.45 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being CA$0.08). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. Gorden Glenn was the only individual insider to buy over the year.Gorden Glenn bought 537.17k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of CA$0.45.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Our data indicates that Minnova insiders own about CA$314k worth of shares (which is 12% of the company). Whilst better than nothing, we're not overly impressed by these holdings.What Might The Insider Transactions At Minnova Tell Us?The recent insider purchase is heartening. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. We would certainly prefer see higher levels of insider ownership but analysis of the insider transactions suggests that Minnova insiders are expecting a bright future.
