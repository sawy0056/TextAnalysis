The case, Sayce v. Forescout Technologies, Inc. et al, No. 20-cv-00076 was filed on January 2, 2020.The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (i) Forescout was experiencing significant volatility with respect to large deals and issues related to the timing and execution of deals in the Company's pipeline, especially in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); (ii) the foregoing was reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on the Company's financial results; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.On October 10, 2019, during pre-market hours, Forescout issued a press release announcing preliminary third quarter 2019 ("3Q19") financial results. That press release lowered 3Q19 revenue guidance to $90.6 million to $91.6 million, compared to prior revenue guidance of $98.8 million to $101.8 million, and market consensus of $100.52 million. In explaining these results, Defendants cited "extended approval cycles which pushed several deals out of the third quarter," which "was most pronounced in EMEA."On this news, ForeScout's stock fell from a closing price of $39.20 per share on October 9, 2019 to $24.57 on October 10, 2019-a $14.63 or 37.32% drop.The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding ForeScout's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.Attorney Advertising.
