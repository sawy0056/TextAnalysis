To keep it practical, we'll show how General Dynamics Corporation's (NYSE:GD) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. General Dynamics has a P/E ratio of 15.46, based on the last twelve months. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying $15.46 for every $1 in prior year profit. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics How Do You Calculate General Dynamics's P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for General Dynamics:P/E of 15.46 = $180.18 ÷ $11.66 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does General Dynamics's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (20.4) for companies in the aerospace & defense industry is higher than General Dynamics's P/E.NYSE:GD Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 4th 2020MoreGeneral Dynamics's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Most would be impressed by General Dynamics earnings growth of 12% in the last year. And earnings per share have improved by 9.2% annually, over the last five years. With that performance, you might expect an above average P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does General Dynamics's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Net debt totals 24% of General Dynamics's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Verdict On General Dynamics's P/E RatioGeneral Dynamics trades on a P/E ratio of 15.5, which is below the US market average of 18.8. The company hasn't stretched its balance sheet, and earnings growth was good last year. The low P/E ratio suggests current market expectations are muted, implying these levels of growth will not continue.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
