Chad says ... after the proposal, someone did approach him with a waiver and told him it was a release so they could use his image in a TV special .. and he signed the doc without reading it," reports TMZ. " But still, Chad says he shouldn't be legally bound by the waiver because he was misled into signing it and he got no compensation in return for signing away his rights."Hurley, who  also posed for a pic with the signed form at the request of Kimye's crew,  is asking the judge to throw out the case and requesting Kardashian and West pay for his legal fees -- not that he can't afford it.Kardashian and West are seeking unspecified damages from Hurley and his company, Avos Systems Inc."Exclusive rights, such as those sold by plaintiffs to publication of video of the event, are particularly valuable," states the couple's initial lawsuit. "If people violate these rights ... they are of substantially diminished value."More From Business Insider Kim Kardashian Defends Donating Small Amount To Charity By Explaining Funds BreakdownKanye West Slams Fake Interview That Quoted Him As Saying 'I Am The Next Nelson Mandela'Kanye West Says Performing Is 'Like Being A Police Officer Or Soldier In War'
