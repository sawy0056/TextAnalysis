The average student loan debt in the U.S. is just shy of $30,000, but several states have already passed that milestone. A report from the Institute for College Access & Success studied the debt loads of 2012 college graduates and found six states whose average student borrower carried more than $29,400 in education loans, which is the national average.The state-by-state breakdown did not include student debt statistics from for-profit colleges, as many did not report such data, despite having a high concentration of borrowers among their students. According to the U.S. Department of Education 2011-2012 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, 88% of graduates from for-profit, four-year colleges take out loans, and those students borrowed 43% more than graduates from four-year, not-for-profit public and private institutions.Among the 10 states with the highest student loan debt averages, Delaware is the only state outside the Midwest and Northeast regions, as determined by the U.S. Census (Delaware is in the South). Minnesota and Iowa are the most western states on the list.The state averages are based on the location of the school attended by the borrower, not the borrower’s residence. For the class of 2012, getting a degree in these states often translated into a hefty debt load.1.
