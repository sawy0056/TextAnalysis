WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama says the bipartisan budget approved by Congress is a hopeful sign that Washington can end its cycle of crisis-driven decisions.Obama in his weekly Saturday radio and Internet address praises the agreement for easing some across-the-board spending cuts that would have otherwise automatically hit programs from defense to education.While praising a new spirit of cooperation, Obama still faults Congress for not extending jobless benefits that will expire this month for 1.3 million Americans.In the Republican address, Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois criticizes the new health care law as unfair to young Americans. He says the law should be scrapped because it shifts costs to younger, healthier people to keep premiums from skyrocketing for others.Schock spoke from Eureka College in Illinois, Ronald Reagan's alma mater.
