LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - Aug 16, 2013) -
According to new research carried out by global property and business space provider, Goodman, employee happiness is linked to commute times, location and environment of work sites.The survey showed that employees are most productive when their commute time is shorter, and with 73% of participants saying their journey to work lasted no longer than half an hour, workforces appear positively efficient.With that said, 70% are prepared to travel more than half an hour further for their dream job despite the risk to their overall wellbeing.Although 79% confirmed that their employer did not operate a travel plan, 72% believed that companies should help find ways to ease the difficulties of their employees' commute.Full time employees commit to an average of 2,000 hours per year to their work life, and commuters travelling longer distances are likely to add a further 500 hours to this.The research also found that although 74% of people weren't offered a work from home scheme, just over half of the people surveyed believed their productivity would increase if they could work from home one or more days per week.A spokesperson from Goodman commented: "One of the biggest impacts on working life is the distance travelled between the worksite and home. Not only does landscape, surroundings and environment play a part in productivity but commuting time does too. We make every effort to ensure we take care of all of the above so that productivity and employee satisfaction, for the businesses that use our parks, are at an all time high."For the full report from Goodman see: http://goodmanbusinessparks.co.uk/news/commuter-trends-survey-results.Goodman business parks are home to 300 companies across their 26 venues.
