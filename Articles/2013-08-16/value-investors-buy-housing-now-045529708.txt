Housing stocks were the darling of 2012 and started off 2013 on a hot streak. But in May, the stocks peaked and it's been downhill ever since even though many of the homebuilders have reported better than expected earnings and the year over year earnings growth is expected to be phenomenal.What gives?The homebuilders are a classic case of what was once hot is now not.But the sell off has created an opportunity for the savvy value investor.In May, many were concerned about excessive valuations of the homebuilders as they hit new highs, but that's not the case now that the stocks have plunged. Far from it.There's plenty of value to be found in many of the homebuilders. Not only that, you can get double digit earnings growth and an attractive Zacks Rank.If you loved the homebuilder stocks as they were going up just a few months ago, now's your chance to get them while they're cheap.Homebuilders are ConfidentIf anything, the fundamentals in the sector have actually improved since the stocks peaked in the spring.On Aug 15, the Homebuilders Confidence Index hit an 8-year high as it rose to 59 from 56 in July. The homebuilders haven't been this confident since the housing boom and bubble years.They have a reason to be confident. Housing inventories, both new and existing, are running a multi-year lows in most major markets yet low interest rates and record stock prices, which have boosted confidence, have spurred buyers.The builders are buying land again and have pricing power in many states.One fly in the ointment may be rising mortgage rates, but even at 5%, mortgage rates would still be near all-time lows. Homebuyers have been in hibernation for 7 years. 2013 has been the first year where buyers have appeared and the demand has not been temporary.The homebuilders believe the momentum will continue into 2014. The pieces are in place. We're in the early stages of the housing recovery.There will be hiccups. But now is a chance to get some of the homebuilders at incredible prices.3 Best Values in HousingM.D.C. Holdings Inc.Ryland Group Inc.Meritage Homes1. M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC)M.D.C.
