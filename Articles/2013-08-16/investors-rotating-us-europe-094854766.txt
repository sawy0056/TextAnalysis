flight of europaMoreflickr/cliff1066Flight of Europa.European equity funds just had their biggest week in more than two years, taking in $2.3 billion in new assets under management (AUM).Curiously, in the same week, U.S. equity funds – which have seen robust expansion of AUM all year, including recent notable inflows of $2 billion a day at the beginning of July – got hit with their first outflows in seven weeks as investors redeemed $1.9 billion."Largest weekly inflows to European equity funds in more than 2 years ($2.3bn) confirms Europe back in fashion," says BofA Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett.Was this week just a blip, or could it be foretelling of a larger trend?On Wednesday, France and Germany reported better-than-expected GDP data, officially lifting the eurozone out of a two-year recession. To be sure, the euro area's economic woes are far from over, as unemployment rates in many countries remain at or near all-time highs.Investors may be warming to the story, though.Last week, Oppenheimer chief market strategist John Stoltzfus passed along a related observation: "Stateside investors are beginning to consider investments in Europe and elsewhere ex-U.S. for diversification once again as multiples expand stateside  and hints that conditions are beginning to improve outside of the U.S., particularly in the developed European markets, emanate."Below is a breakdown of this week's fund flows, via Hartnett:Asset Class Flows Equities : modest $1.3bn inflows (7 straight weeks) (all via LO funds)Bonds : $1.4bn outflows ($60bn outflows since Jun'13)Commodities : tiny $66mn outflows (record 27 straight weeks)Equity Flows Largest weekly inflows to European equity funds
