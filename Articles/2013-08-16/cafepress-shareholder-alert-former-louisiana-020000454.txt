According to the Complaint, following the Company's July 30, 2012 disclosure that there has been a trend of increased complexity and competitiveness in the marketplace, negatively impacting its small shop customers and that because of this trend, the Company had been building up its larger shop business to replace the erosion of smaller shop revenue, the value of CafePress shares declined significantly.About Kahn Swick & Foti, LLCTo learn more about KSF, whose partners include the Former Louisiana Attorney General, Charles C.
