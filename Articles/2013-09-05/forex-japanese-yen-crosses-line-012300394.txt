Talking Points: Dollar Stumbles as US Stocks Surge, Taper Countdown Continues
Japanese Yen Crosses Line Up for Breakout Ahead of BoJ Decision
Australian Dollar’s Data-Driven Rally May Run Out of Steam Without Risk Trends Dollar Stumbles as US Stocks Surge, Taper Countdown ContinuesA global equities rally rounded out by the biggest advance for the US Indexes in two weeks generated enough friction to send the dollar reeling Wednesday. While the greenback has found itself unable to leverage much strength out of risk aversion gusts over the past weeks, the liquidity purveyor nevertheless remains exposed to swells in risk appetite that move capital towards higher yield and in some cases depressed (Australian dollar, emerging market debt, etc) assets. Looking across the majors, there are more than a few pairings dangerously poised for a more prolific anti-dollar move. A more convincing climb in traditional capital market benchmarks (like the S&P 500) and carry interest could secure a near-term break against the greenback – even if the follow through would struggle. Event risk over the next 48 hours is significant and should be considered more trend defining. The G20 meeting doesn’t have a black-and-white outcome but Friday’s NFPs do.Japanese Yen Crosses Line Up for Breakout Ahead of BoJ DecisionThe Japanese yen crosses were up across the board (equating to a yen decline) Wednesday in a trend that has developed through the week. With the most recent bout of gains, however, we are starting to come into overhead technical resistance. This is a particularly well-timed point of contention given the event risk that we face this morning in Tokyo trade: the Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate decision. The central bank’s threats and ultimate actions to leverage an unprecedented stimulus program to end deflation – and, it is argued, to lower the yen – forced a structural shift for USDJPY and its counterparts. Yet, despite the clout this event holds, it is unlikely to deliver the satisfaction those trading momentum need to clear to the next stage of advance. While we will look for comments pertaining to the central bank’s willingness to escalate should Prime Minister Abe proceed with the tax hike, we are unlikely to see change today. Policy may not provide, but risk trends may fulfill our needs… British Pound Looks for Further Action from BoE Governor CarneyThe July and August Bank of England (BoE) policy gatherings have been particularly interesting for sterling traders. With the new Governor, Mark Carney, we have seen the introduction of forward guidance (rates untouched until 2016), been given clear targets for policy (7.0 percent jobless rate) and the reemergence of dissent for the future moves. Against the backdrop of quick upturn in the UK economic readings, it is easy to understand why the market is on edge with the upcoming decision due at 11:00 GMT. Yet, given the significant steps made recently, the probability of further substantial change is low. Pound traders should watch to see whether Carney will make a habit of post-meet commentary. Australian Dollar’s Data-Driven Rally May Run Out of Steam Without Risk TrendsIn the past three active trading sessions, the Australian dollar has surged. From the start of the week, AUDJPY is now up 4.5 percent, AUDUSD 3.0 percent and even AUDNZD is 0.7 percent in the green. This incredible run for the high-yield currency has been sourced from the Australian docket itself rather than external sources. That said, the major catalysts have passed. In the wake of the shift in tone following the RBA rate decision, the better-than-expected 2Q GDP reading and trade numbers amongst other releases; the Aussie dollar has covered a lot of ground. With pairs like AUDUSD facing down significant resistance on the back of winded short-term momentum, the threat of correction is high. An outside push is what the currency needs. A swell in the appetite for higher risk positions is needed to backup the improved yield outlook.Euro Traders Have Low Expectations for ECB, Try to Ignore Local Rumblings The European Central Bank (ECB) will deliberate monetary policy in the upcoming trading session and is set to deliver the consensus at 11:45 GMT. What matters to traders is whether there will be any deviation from the current line of expectations, and that is a particularly low probability. However, there is room for nuance – which market participants have proven adept at ferreting out if the response to recent RBA and Fed policy events is any gauge. As such, the 12:30 GMTpress conference with ECB President Mario Draghi will hold greater market-moving potential. Yet, there isn’t much scope for change as the economic and financial situation in the region remains stable. In fact, there are a number of issues starting to develop in the backdrop, but the complacency is remains particularly strong with this currency and region. At the top of the list is the impending (next Monday) debate in Italy about whether to ouster Silvio Berlusconi and the implications that has for the coalition.Story continuesEmerging Markets: Will India’s New Central Bank Governor Curb Help the Rupee?The MSCI Emerging Market equity ETF advanced for a fifth consecutive day Wednesday with the biggest jump in a month for the day. The FX performance for the ‘developing’ groupwas one of the most consistently encouraging seen in a while. The Indian Rupee, South African Rand, Russian Ruble, Turkish Lira and Singapore Dollar all posted gains against the US dollar; while the Brazilian real – one of the biggest losses – printed only a modest 0.1 percent slip. This isheartening, but it shouldn’t yet be considered a definitive foundation of strength – rather it looks more like tentative stabilization. Top news out of the grouping were the reforms introduced by brand new Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan on his first day. The moves seem lasting developments, but they won’t necessarily curb another wave of panicked capital withdrawal should global risk appetite fall apart again.Gold Developing Congestion Above $1,385, Tepid Demand Despite Dollar DropIn an unexpected twist, gold stumbled this past session at the same time that the benchmark US dollar dove. Typically, the currency acts as a gauge of demand for traditional fiat and the indirectly the appetite for a viable alternative. The1.5 percent drop for the precious metal was the largest in four weeksand pulled the market back below the closely watched $1,400 on the close. Yet, this particularly large move does not immediately present itself as the catalyst for something more maleficent than a sharp swing within a developing range. From the fundamental backdrop, the near-certainty of a September Taper continues to rebuild the value of the dollar as a store of wealth, while improved growth and assumed financial stability in other developed leaders curbs the panicked demand for an alternative. From the speculative side, the gold futures volume settled below the monthly average from Tuesday’s three-week high and open interest is still troughing at 389,000 contracts. The 24.6 percent CBOE Gold Volatility Index reading is a constant reminder to traders how risky this ‘safe haven’ can be.**For a full list of upcoming event risk and past releases, go to www.dailyfx.com/calendarECONOMIC DATA
