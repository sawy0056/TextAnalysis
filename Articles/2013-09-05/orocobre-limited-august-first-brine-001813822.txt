BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA--(Marketwired - Sep 4, 2013) -
Orocobre Limited (ORL.TO)(ORE.AX) ("Orocobre" or "the Company") is pleased to announce the commissioning of the first production wells and the commencement of the filling of the first evaporation pond at the Olaoroz lithium project.To view a photo of the first flow into the evaporation pond, please visit the following link: http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/orl904a.pdfThe first pumping and filling of evaporation pond 4B occurred at the beginning of August to coincide with the local customary celebration of Pachamama (Mother Earth). This was four weeks earlier than scheduled. Additional bores have been commissioned and pumping has been increased to 30% of design rate and is scheduled to achieve the full rate by November.The filling of evaporation pond 4B is significant for a number of reasons. Firstly, the commencement of the brine filling is ahead of schedule. Secondly, this effectively signals the beginning of the first step in the process of manufacture of lithium carbonate. Finally, it signals the end of a period where there were a high number of concurrent activities in progress and also where we reached the peak headcount on site.The project continues to proceed on time and within budget. A total of US$121m has been spent or committed via executed contracts in the construction project to date.A summary of the recent and current activities on site is listed below with some images capturing the recent journey.The following tasks are currently in progress and at varying stages of completion:Foundations and metal structure fabrication for process plant buildings, soda ash warehouse, finished product warehouse and maintenance facilities Construction of warehouse and maintenance workshop building Groundwork and concrete foundations of water treatment plant Waste water treatment plant 2nd stage Drilling of the remaining 6 brine wells Installation of deep well pumps Civil works in the brine collection area Evaporation pond construction (conclusion of pond P1, P2, P3) Erection of liming plant structure and equipment Water plant tank construction Gas pipeline construction Erection of final modules for the camp Camp infrastructure construction (erection and connection of bulk gas tanks) Overflow channel construction Construction of process buildings (main building, soda ash and end product storage) Liner installation of second evaporation pond Construction of reinforced earth gabions for transfer pumps foundation Construction of overhead power lines To view photos of the evaporation pond, please visit the following link: http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/orl904b.pdf.More images, including aerial photographs are available on our web page under "Gallery".
