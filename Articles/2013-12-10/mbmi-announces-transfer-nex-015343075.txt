RICHMOND HILL, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Dec 9, 2013) -
MBMI RESOURCES INC. ("MBMI" or the "Company") (TSX VENTURE:MBR.H) announces that effective on December 6, 2013, the listing of the Company's common shares has been transferred to the NEX from the TSX Venture Exchange. As a result, the trading symbol for MBMI's shares will change from MBR to MBR.H effective on December 6, 2013. This transfer to the NEX results from the Cease Trade Orders issued against MBMI as consequence of its failure to file its audited annual financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2013 and related filings, as well as its interim financial statements and related filings for subsequent reporting periods.Management of MBMI confirms that it continues to work towards the completion and filing of these annual and interim financial statements and related filings, all in an effort to permit the termination of the Cease Trade Orders currently in force in Canada regarding MBMI.MBMI cautions its shareholders that trading of its shares in Canada on NEX continues to be suspended, so long as the Cease Trade Orders remain in force. The Company's reinstatement to trading on the NEX (and ultimately on the TSX Venture Exchange, if possible) will only resume after the current Cease Trade Orders issued by the Alberta and British Columbia Securities Commissions are revoked and the TSX Venture Exchange completes the applicable reinstatement review and authorizes trading of MBMI's shares to commence again on NEX or, if possible, the TSX Venture Exchange.Cautionary Statement:Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.
