SEATTLE (AP) -- After an election recount Monday, a proposition to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in the city of SeaTac appears to have survived, King County election officials said.The measure passed by 77 votes in last month's election, with 6,003 votes counted.Ballots for SeaTac Proposition 1 were recounted by hand Monday, and no changes were identified, election director Sherril Huff said in a statement Monday afternoon.The recount results were expected to be finalized Tuesday.The recount was requested by Common Sense SeaTac, a business group that opposed the proposition.The SeaTac minimum wage campaign drew $1.8 million in spending in the small city, with national labor groups supporting higher pay and national business groups opposing.The measure, which would require a $15 minimum wage and a handful of paid sick days for about 6,500 workers, is set to take effect Jan. 1.Washington has the nation's highest state minimum wage at $9.19 an hour. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.The proposition is also facing a court challenge, led by Alaska Airlines' owner, Alaska Air Group Inc. The airline is challenging whether an initiative can give the city authority over the airport, which is operated by the Port of Seattle.A hearing is scheduled Friday before King County Superior Court Judge Andrea Darvas.
