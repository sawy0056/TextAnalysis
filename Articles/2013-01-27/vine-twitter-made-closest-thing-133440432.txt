Remember the movie Being John Malkovich?In the movie, John Cusack's character would climb through a long tunnel and come out the other side feeling as if he were another person – inside of them, seeing and feeling the world through that person's eyes.(In a twist, that person would always be the actor John Malkovich, who plays a fictionalized version of himself in the movie.)Anyway, I bring this up because Twitter's new social media app for the iPhone, Vine, is the closest thing to a real-life Being John Malkovich I have ever seen.For six seconds, you see and hear the world through someone else's eyes.You can try the app to see it for yourself. Or, you can go to a Website called Vinepeek – a live feed of the very latest videos from Vine, built by   a company called PXi.
(Warning: It's completely unedited and unfiltered, so, who knows what will pop up there.)The odd thing about how exciting Vine is that other people's lives are actually pretty mundane.You see a lot of kids on swings, people looking at the TV, people at a restaurant. This mundane nature hasn't made the app any less thrilling yet. But maybe that'll wear off. For now though, it's a rush to hop around the world and see what other people were seeing and hearing moments ago.Go check out Vinepeek >>Learn how to use Vine below:  //Please enable Javascript to watch this videoMore From Business Insider FACEBOOK: Yeah, We're Getting Tough With DevelopersFacebook Management Decides To Nuke Twitter's Big New ProductTwitter Has A Really Cool New Video App For iPhone
