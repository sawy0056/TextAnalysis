CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Jan 22, 2014) -
Crescent Point Energy Corp. ("Crescent Point" or the "Company") (CPG.TO)(CPG) is pleased to announce that its shares opened for trading today on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), under the symbol "CPG". KCG Americas LLC is the Designated Market Maker for Crescent Point shares."We're excited about our NYSE listing and the added exposure to the U.S. and international investor base," said Scott Saxberg, president and CEO of Crescent Point. "In recent years, we've grown significantly in the U.S. We've acquired assets in the Uinta Basin in Utah and the Bakken resource play in North Dakota, and we opened an office in Denver in 2011. Moving on to the NYSE really complements our strategic expansion and long-term plans for growth in the U.S.""We welcome Crescent Point Energy Corp. to the NYSE's listed company community," said Scott Cutler, Executive Vice President & Head of Global Listings, NYSE Euronext. "We congratulate Crescent Point on its first day of trading on the NYSE and look forward to a long-standing partnership with Crescent Point and its shareholders."OPERATIONAL UPDATEAs previously announced, Crescent Point exceeded its 2013 exit production guidance of 124,000 boe/d in fourth quarter. Strong growth continued in December and the Company estimates that it exited the year with a production rate greater than 126,500 boe/d. The Company has continued this momentum into an active start to 2014. Currently, Crescent Point has 24 drilling rigs in operation across its asset base, 19 of which are in the Company's core Saskatchewan Bakken and Shaunavon resource plays. Cold weather this winter has not impacted the Company's operations."We're pleased with our first quarter results so far and feel we're in a great position to deliver another strong year to our shareholders," said Saxberg. "We're focused on applying our 25-stage cemented liner completion techniques, which include the extended reach coil tubing unit technology, and applying waterfloods in all of our major unconventional oil fields. These technologies have been a driving force behind our multi-year track record of production and reserves growth, and we expect they'll continue to give us a technical advantage as we proceed with our plans for the year."Crescent Point has set a $1.75 billion capital expenditures budget for 2014. Execution of the budget is expected to increase average daily production to 126,500 boe/d, with a 2014 exit production rate of 135,000 boe/d. The 2014 capital program is consistent with the Company's five-year growth models, which forecast long-term production per share growth and dividend sustainability under a variety of commodity price scenarios.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements contained in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
