PARIS--(Marketwired - Jun 11, 2013) - Sercel announces today the launch of Sentinel(®) MS, its new multi-sensor solid streamer to address the needs of the E&P Industry for ever more detailed and accurate images of the subsurface.Sentinel MS builds on the success of the Sentinel solid streamer. In addition to the high-quality pressure measurement provided by its hydrophone sensor the new Sentinel MS features two additional acceleration components offering directional measurements for both cross-line and vertical wave fronts, to deliver multi-sensor data sets for enhanced broadband imaging.Fully compatible with Nautilus(®), Sercel's powerful all-in-one streamer positioning system, Sentinel MS extends marine acquisition capabilities to a new level. The addition of directional measurements to the most advanced low-noise, low-frequency capabilities of Sercel's Sentinel solid streamer family makes the new Sentinel MS the multi-sensor streamer system of choice in any geophysical environment.Pascal Rouiller, CEO, Sercel, said: "We have added the Sentinel MS multi-sensor streamer to our Sentinel family to offer the industry the best broadband capabilities as part of our on-going commitment to deliver the highest-end seismic equipment to our customers. With over 5,000 km of Sentinel streamers delivered to date, our Sentinel family, including the Sentinel MS and Sentinel RD, is unmistakably the best solid cable available to the industry today."Jean-Georges Malcor, CEO, CGG, said: "Sentinel has played a significant role in the development of broadband marine seismic and is at the heart of our BroadSeis™ and StagSeis™ marine acquisition solutions. With the launch of Sentinel MS, we can now take our long-offset, full-azimuth and broadband marine seismic to the next step in imaging and enhanced illumination of the most complex geologies."About CGGCGG (www.cgg.com) is a fully integrated Geoscience company providing leading geological, geophysical and reservoir capabilities to its broad base of customers primarily from the global oil and gas industry.
