CHICAGO, ILLINOIS--(Marketwired - Jun 11, 2013) -
Euromonitor International is pleased to announce a new white paper, Sustainability and The New Normal for Natural Resources, outlining how organizations can cut costs, build their reputation and decrease long-term dependency on natural resources, leading to a more efficient business model."Growing demand and competition for natural resources is already causing supply constraints and price volatility, and it is likely to remain at the forefront of business issues in the future," said Sarah Boumphrey, Head of Countries & Consumers Research at Euromonitor. "This, coupled with consumer and government demands for sustainability, makes resource management a priority for all companies."The white paper analyses key drivers impacting demand for natural resources, taking into account economic, demographic and income growth as well as environmental concerns and the rise of sustainability. The risks for businesses include operational, reputational, regulatory and market risks posed by the physical, geopolitical and economic threats affecting supply. "We have reached a new normal of increased awareness of the real value of natural resources whatever the physical price and a heightened consciousness around resource security," said Boumphrey.Issues around natural resources and sustainability present opportunities for business as well as risks, and these opportunities, including new avenues for growth and the emergence of new business models are discussed at length.
