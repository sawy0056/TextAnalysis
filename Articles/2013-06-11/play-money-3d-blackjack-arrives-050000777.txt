LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - Jun 11, 2013) -
When the first game of '21' was dealt on PKR.com all those years ago, who'd have thought the poker platform would become so well known for its alternative casino games? Now, on the back of its desktop success, the brand has doubled-down and transferred 3D blackjack to iOS.Collectively, PKR's mobile poker, blackjack and roulette apps have exceeded over half a million downloads.A spokesperson for PKR commented:"Our members know their stuff when it comes to playability and so we really wanted to get this app right for them before the release on iPhone. Blackjack is a quick game and it's arguably the coolest card in the deck - this 3D version was always destined for mobile."It's unlikely you'll get through a full poker tournament during a bus ride but a sharp game of blackjack is perfect. The software developers have outdone themselves again here. To get so many downloads so soon is amazing and we're just looking forward to our next projects for mobile now."Mobile users can download the 3D blackjack game from the App Store here - it is compatible with iOS 4:3 and above, supporting the following features:Free chip bonus and regular giveaways
