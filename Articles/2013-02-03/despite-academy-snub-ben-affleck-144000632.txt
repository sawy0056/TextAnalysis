He wasn't even nominated for an Oscar, but on Saturday night Ben Affleck received the top directing prize at the Director's Guild of America Awards (DGA) -- voted on by his fellow directors. The "Good Will Hunting" actor beat out top talent including Kathryn Bigelow for "Zero Dark Thirty," Tom Hooper for "Les Miserables," Ang Lee for "Life of Pi" and Steven Spielberg for "Lincoln." "I don't this makes me a real director, but I think it means I'm on my way," Affleck said while accepting the award.After "Argo" has had big wins at the Critics Choice Awards, SAG Awards, AFI Awards and Producers Guild Awards, the DGA win is a big indicator that the film will also do well at the Academy Awards come February 24.In fact, according to the LA Times, "only six times since the DGA Awards began in 1948 have the two honors differed" in the Best Director category.Only problem is that Affleck was "mind-bogglingly" snubbed by the Academy and isn't even nominated in the Best Director category at the Oscars.Directors Kathryn Bigelow and Tom Hooper, DGA nominees, were also left off the Academy's list.But Affleck wasn't the only big winner of the night. Lena Dunham was also lauded for "Girls," Rian Johnson for "Breaking Bad" and Jay Roach for "Game Change" were also honored.See the full list of winners below:FEATURE FILM*WINNER BEN AFFLECK Argo(Warner Bros.
