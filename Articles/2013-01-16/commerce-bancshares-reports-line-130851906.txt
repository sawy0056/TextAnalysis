Our Viewpoint
Strong capital base and an excellent liquidity enable Commerce Bancshares to position itself comfortably for expansion via acquisitions. Moreover, the company’s direct retail and commercial banking franchise are expected to perform steadily. Its focus on developing in the high-growth areas and efforts to reorganize expenses would also prove accretive to overall growth in the future.
However, prevailing low interest rates, diminishing loan demands and muted economic growth are expected to hurt Commerce Bancshares’ overall performance. Also, the recently proposed financial rules and the stringent regulatory landscape are matters of concern.
