Afternoon Technicals (all charts)Other TA (crosses, COT, etc.)FOREX Trading and Technical Analysis ObservationsEURUSD longs taken late yesterday were stopped out at breakeven (13275). The correction probably lasts the remainder of the week but levels that may produce a low are the 50% and 61.8% retracements of the rally from the 1/4 low at 13200 and 13150. The levels line up with former pivots as well. The former level is reinforced by former trendline support turned resistance (blue line on chart).“The EURAUD decline from 12710 would consist of 2 equal legs at 12612 but Fibonacci retracements don’t begin until 12575 (38.2% of 12357-12710). The 50% at 12533 is reinforced by former resistance from the 1/8 high at 12529. Be picky…let the correction play out this week or take advantage of a sharp drop into 12529/75.” Currently at 12580, we may get an opportunity to buy weakness tonight or tomorrow on event risk out of Australia.The EURJPY is nearing potential support from former resistance (1/2 high) at 11598. Potential trendline support comes in at about 11520 today and increases roughly 35 pips per day. Keep in mind that January’s opening range was broken to the upside and the monthly low is 11354.EURUSD - DailyFOREX_Trading_EURUSD_Focus_is_on_13200_for_Next_Long_Opportunity_body_eurusd.png, FOREX Trading: EUR/USD Focus is on 13200 for Next Long OpportunityPrepared by Jamie Saettele, CMTEURAUD –DailyFOREX_Trading_EURUSD_Focus_is_on_13200_for_Next_Long_Opportunity_body_euraud.png, FOREX Trading: EUR/USD Focus is on 13200 for Next Long OpportunityPrepared by Jamie Saettele, CMTEURJPY – Daily BarsFOREX_Trading_EURUSD_Focus_is_on_13200_for_Next_Long_Opportunity_body_eurjpy.png, FOREX Trading: EUR/USD Focus is on 13200 for Next Long OpportunityPrepared by Jamie Saettele, CMT--- Written by Jamie Saettele, CMT, Senior Technical Strategist for DailyFX.comTo contact Jamie e-mail jsaettele@dailyfx.com.
