The first trading day of the year (1/2) has produced the month to date (and year) low. In other words, the opening range for the month and year has been broken to the upside so it’s possible that the monthly and even yearly lows are in place. FOREXTrading Strategy: The correction probably needs at least the rest of this week. 8900/16 is resistance and 8740/75 is support ahead of the monthly low. Near term shorts are favored into 8900 for a drop into 8740/75. That level may produce the next longer term buying opportunity.LEVELS: 8693 8738 8828 8916 8967 9000DailyFX provides forex news and technical analysis on the trends that influence the global currency markets.Learn forex trading with a free practice account and trading charts from FXCM.
