SANTA CLARA, CA--(Marketwired - Oct 16, 2013) -
PointDrive, a smarter content delivery tool for sales-minded professionals, launches today from DEMO Fall 2013 and is available at www.pointdrive.com, free through the end of the year. PointDrive enables a professional to quickly deliver documents, images, links, videos and comments in one polished, cohesive presentation that returns intelligence on customer engagement. PointDrive presentations are responsive, ensuring content displays beautifully on all devices. Working with LinkedIn and DropBox, with plans to add Google Contacts this year, PointDrive provides easy access to existing content, contacts and profile information to help you build your presentations faster.The Problem: Email Just Doesn't Cut ItWhen sending content that needs to make an impact, email falls short. So far, sales professionals have been forced to rely on email or storage and collaboration tools to deliver content to their prospects and customers. By disconnecting messaging from content, deemphasizing the presentation component, and ignoring customer engagement, these methods do not effectively support the sales process."Professionals know that email is not always the best tool for the job. Just as we select chat for internal conversations and collaboration tools for project management, you can now choose PointDrive for delivering content that needs to make an impact. PointDrive, with its emphasis on presentation and recipient feedback, is the right tool for sending a proposal with supporting content, delivering an investor pitch, presenting creative work, and any other time you need multiple assets to tell one important story," said Bill Burnett, co-founder and chief executive officer of PointDrive.The Solution: Smart, Easy Content Delivery with PointDriveThrough the end of the year, PointDrive's Pro Version is available at no cost at www.pointdrive.com and includes a host of business-class features and functionality for every type of professional:Build and send unlimited branded presentations with all types of files, links and images, alongside commentary. Personalize the presentation by adding a profile picture, contact information, logo and header image. Building a PointDrive presentation is as quick and easy as creating an email with attachments. Integration with LinkedIn and Dropbox, with plans to add Google Contacts and others soon, means immediate access to profile information, files and contacts. Responsive design means PointDrive presentations will open beautifully on any device, no matter what types of files are included. Feedback and share features allow the recipient to reply to the sender within the presentation, and share the presentation as a whole with other contacts. Insights inform the sender on when presentations and individual assets are viewed and shared. Users will receive email alerts when recipients respond and take action. A daily digest of activity as well as a full history of touch points with all targets are available in the product.
