It has been clamping down on insider trading and has frozen initial public offerings for over a year to ensure the quality of companies listing on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.Xiao also said the government should work to quickly launch a planned pilot project allowing companies to issue preferred shares. Preferred stock is a class of equity that has preference over common stock when it comes to dividend payments and asset liquidation, but ordinarily does not trade, carries no voting rights and does not dilute net profits attributable to other shareholders.(Reporting by Kazunori Takada; Editing by Chris Gallagher)
