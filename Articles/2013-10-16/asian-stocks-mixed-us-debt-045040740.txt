MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Asian stock markets fluctuated between gains and losses Wednesday as a deadline for divided U.S. lawmakers to agree on a higher government borrowing limit drew ever closer.Unless Congress acts by Thursday, the government will lose its ability to borrow and will be required to meet its obligations by relying on cash in hand and incoming tax receipts. That could mean the U.S. is unable to repay holders of Treasury bills that mature in coming days and would be in default on its debt.Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.2 percent at 14,464.04 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.4 percent to 23,226.53.

It is inevitable that the U.S. will miss an agreement before the deadline," he said.On Wall Street, stocks were flat or down all day Tuesday, but the size of the losses waxed and waned depending on which politician was giving a press conference about the budget impasse.
