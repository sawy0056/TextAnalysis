American Capital reported its second quarter operating results on July 31, 2013.

Further, operating revenue was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $139 million.   Total interest and dividend income was $118 million, down 22% from the same quarter in the prior year. The weighted average effective interest rate on the company's debt investments declined 20 basis points from the end of the prior quarter to 10.4%, as of June 30, 2013.   Past due and non-accruing loans increased to $245 million (4.6% of total investments), from $208 million as the end of first quarter.  Interest coverage and debt service coverage ratios declined to 2.0 and 1.4 respectively from 2.2 and 1.6 at the end of the first quarter.   Downwards Revisions   Due to disappointing results, quarterly and annual estimates have been revised downwards in the past couple of months. Zacks consensus estimates for the current quarter and year are now $0.23 and $0.91 respectively down from $0.26 and $0.99 per share, 90 days ago.   Current consensus estimate represents 24% year-over-year earnings decline for the current year.
