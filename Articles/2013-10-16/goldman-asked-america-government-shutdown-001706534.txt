"Of note, 47% of respondents with household income <$35k indicated they felt impacted, compared to only 32% of respondents earning >$100K per household."Two weeks of government shutdown have helped erase two years of consumer confidence gains, as high-frequency measures of sentiment like Gallup's daily Economic Confidence Index have plummeted since the beginning of October.Yesterday, Goldman published the results of a separate, quarterly survey of 2,000 consumers. The report said the disparity in sentiment toward the economy between low- and high-income households in the third quarter was the largest in the history of the survey, which began 2005.Spending patterns in Q3 reflected the widening divergence in sentiment — high-income houses spent more, while low-income households pared back.More From Business Insider Two Weeks Of Government Shutdown Have Helped Erase Two Years Of Consumer Confidence GainsCHART OF THE DAY: THE ECONOMY IS NOW AT DEFCON 3ANALYST: This Is The Tea Party's 'Alamo' — The Odds Of Default Are 20%
