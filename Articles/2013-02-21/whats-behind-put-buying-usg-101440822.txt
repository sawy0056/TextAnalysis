USG fell sharply yesterday, and traders are positioning for more potential downside in the building-materials company. More than 5,000 March 29 puts traded in a strong buying pattern, led by a print of 4,787 that went for $1.05, according to optionMONSTER's Depth Charge tracking system. These are new positions, as open interest in the strike was just 690 contracts before the session began.The puts, which lock in the price where traders can sell shares, were not tied to any stock action identified by our systems yesterday. They could have been bought as a protective hedge on a long position established earlier or as a straight bearish bet that USG will slide further by expiration in mid-March.
