Gold and silver prices have found interim support after yesterday’s selloff as traders look ahead to soft US CPI data. Crude oil and copper may follow suit.Talking PointsGold and Silver Prices Find Interim Support Before US Inflation ReportCrude Oil, Copper May Rise if Soft CPI Caps Hawkish Fed Outlook Shift Crude Oil and copper prices followed gold and silver lower as expected yesterday in the wake of a hawkish shift in tone found in minutes from January’s FOMC meeting. The selloff in the cycle-sensitive commodities reflected worries about the implications of unwinding stimulus in the world’s largest economy on its still-fragile recovery. The slump in precious metals spoke to eroding demand for anti-fiat assets, with the US Dollar pushing higher as traders scaled back the degree of QE dilution due to threaten the benchmark currency in the months ahead.Looking ahead, US Consumer Price Index figures come into the spotlight. Consensus forecasts point to a slight tick lower on the headline year-on-year inflation rate, down to 1.6 percent in January from 1.7 percent in the prior month. The outcome would mark the third consecutive decline as well as the lowest reading since July 2012. That may pour a bit of cold water on the nascent hawkish shift in traders’ Fed policy expectations. Gold and silver are already finding support before the CPI print crosses the wires.
