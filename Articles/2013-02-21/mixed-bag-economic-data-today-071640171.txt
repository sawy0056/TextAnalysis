Homebuilders fell yesterday after housing starts missed estimates badly, so another weak number could trigger more selling in the industry.The Energy Department will report natural-gas inventories at 10:30 a.m. ET and crude-oil inventories at 11 a.m. ET.Retail giant Wal-Mart Stores is also scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings before the opening bell.More From optionMONSTER How bulls are playing Electronic ArtsAudiocast: Why VIX calls are surgingLower volatility seen for silver fund
