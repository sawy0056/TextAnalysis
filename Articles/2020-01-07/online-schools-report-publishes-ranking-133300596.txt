OSR, the new student resource site, based their ranking strictly on data, prioritizing the school's ability to deliver an online education comparable to an on-campus degree.Do you understand the Dewey Decimal System? It isn't so easy. Librarians are some of the most rigorously trained workers out there. Library science is a very technical discipline, balancing information sciences, archiving techniques, and cataloguing. On top of that, public libraries themselves are often the heart of a community. Besides loaning books, libraries host events, teach children how to read, and provide crucial resources like computer and printer access—all for free!Based on the numbers, these are the programs to get you the experience you'll need.OSR uses six data points to determine the best programs in a given field. Three data points focus on the quality of the school, and three focus on the quality of the individual program under consideration. OSR included these programs in the ranking because their students graduate with minimal debt and have a great support system while in school. These schools have proven their dedication to quality online education.For a detailed description of the methodology, visit www.onlineschoolsreport.com/methodology.Online education is getting bigger and better—and giving traditional college campuses a run for their money.
