The first domain was registered in 1985 and with the increase of online crime and the launch of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), brands now need to take more proactive steps to protect their reputation and their customers. Domains can be a significant asset for organizations, not just in terms of brand building and competitive distinction but also in boosting revenue through increased web traffic, setting up brands for long-term success by building trust, professionalism and credibility. As such the MarkMonitor domain management business fits well within the Clarivate intellectual property solution portfolio."MarkMonitor has a strong heritage as the leading enterprise-level domain registrar trusted by organizations globally to establish their online presence and protect their domain portfolios," said Jeff Roy, President, IP Group, Clarivate Analytics. "We look forward to continuing investing in this business and aligning it with our entire IP portfolio, including CompuMark, Derwent, Techstreet and Darts-ip, to deliver more impactful solutions and reach more customers."He concluded, "Meanwhile, we are confident that under its new ownership, the brand protection business will continue to serve some of the world's greatest brands with even greater excellence."About Clarivate AnalyticsClarivate Analytics™ is a global leader in providing trusted insights and analytics to accelerate the pace of innovation.
