If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Collection House. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Collection House for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Collection House! ASX:CLH Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Collection House paid out 37% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Collection House's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Collection House has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was AU$0.048 in 2010, compared to AU$0.082 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.5% a year over that time.Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Collection House has grown its earnings per share at 8.7% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a credible rate. What's more, the payout ratio is reasonable and provides some protection to the dividend, or even the potential to increase it.We'd also point out that Collection House issued a meaningful number of new shares in the past year. Regularly issuing new shares can be detrimental - it's hard to grow dividends per share when new shares are regularly being created.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Collection House's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Firstly, we like that Collection House has a low and conservative payout ratio. We like that it has been delivering solid improvement in its earnings per share, and relatively consistent dividend payments. Overall, we think there are a lot of positives to Collection House from a dividend perspective.Story continuesEarnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
