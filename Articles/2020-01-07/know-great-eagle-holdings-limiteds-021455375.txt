That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Great Eagle Holdings Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company.

If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Great Eagle Holdings's earnings per share fell by 49% in the last twelve months. But EPS is up 21% over the last 5 years.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Great Eagle Holdings's Balance SheetGreat Eagle Holdings has net debt worth a very significant 109% of its market capitalization. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you must keep in mind that these debt levels would usually warrant a relatively low P/E.The Verdict On Great Eagle Holdings's P/E RatioGreat Eagle Holdings has a P/E of 4.2. That's below the average in the HK market, which is 10.7.
