(BME:GEST) An Attractive Dividend Stock?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosCould Gestamp Automoción, S.A. (BME:GEST) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.With only a two-year payment history, and a 3.0% yield, investors probably think Gestamp Automoción is not much of a dividend stock. Many of the best dividend stocks typically start out paying a low yield, so we wouldn't automatically cut it from our list of prospects. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Gestamp Automoción for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Gestamp Automoción! BME:GEST Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that of Gestamp Automoción's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Last year, Gestamp Automoción paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.Is Gestamp Automoción's Balance Sheet Risky?As Gestamp Automoción has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 2.77 times its EBITDA, Gestamp Automoción's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 3.45 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Gestamp Automoción, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Gestamp Automoción's latest financial position,

The dividend has not fluctuated much, but with a relatively short payment history, we can't be sure this is sustainable across a full market cycle. Its most recent annual dividend was €0.13 per share, effectively flat on its first payment two years ago.Story continuesIt's good to see at least some dividend growth. Yet with a relatively short dividend paying history, we wouldn't want to depend on this dividend too heavily.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. It's good to see Gestamp Automoción has been growing its earnings per share at 14% a year over the past five years. A company paying out less than a quarter of its earnings as dividends, and growing earnings at more than 10% per annum, looks to be right in the cusp of its growth phase. At the right price, we might be interested.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Firstly, the company has a conservative payout ratio, although we'd note that its cashflow in the past year was substantially lower than its reported profit. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, although its dividend history is not as long as we'd like. In sum, we find it hard to get excited about Gestamp Automoción from a dividend perspective. It's not that we think it's a bad business; just that there are other companies that perform better on these criteria.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
