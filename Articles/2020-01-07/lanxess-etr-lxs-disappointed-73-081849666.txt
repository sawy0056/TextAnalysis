And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term LANXESS Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:LXS) shareholders have enjoyed a 73% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 19% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 43% , including dividends . See our latest analysis for LANXESS While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last half decade, LANXESS became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. In fact, the LANXESS stock price is 6.6% lower in the last three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 6.4% per year. So there seems to be a mismatch between the positive EPS growth and the change in the share price, which is down -2.3% per year.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).XTRA:LXS Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreWe know that LANXESS has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, LANXESS's TSR for the last 5 years was 85%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that LANXESS shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 43% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
