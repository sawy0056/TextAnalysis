Identity Hub extends Prebid’s open-source User ID module, making it easier for publishers to monetize programmatically and ensure buyers can recognize and bid on their desired audiences as third-party cookies become more restricted.The increase of consumer privacy regulations and reactions from tech platforms to block the usage of third-party cookies has caused audience addressability to erode.

Against this landscape, the digital advertising ecosystem is scrambling to find solutions to these challenges.“As the digital advertising ecosystem urgently looks for consumer-friendly audience addressability solutions, the rapid expansion of ID choices is creating growing complexity.
