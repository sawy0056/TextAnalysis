And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like NIBE Industrier (STO:NIBE B). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. Check out our latest analysis for NIBE Industrier How Fast Is NIBE Industrier Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. NIBE Industrier managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note NIBE Industrier's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 16% to kr25b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for NIBE Industrier?Are NIBE Industrier Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Like standing at the lookout, surveying the horizon at sunrise, insider buying, for some investors, sparks joy. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.In the last twelve months NIBE Industrier insiders spent kr440k on stock; good news for shareholders. While this isn't much, we also note an absence of sales.Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for NIBE Industrier is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at kr25b. Coming in at 29% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.While insiders already own a significant amount of shares, and they have been buying more, the good news for ordinary shareholders does not stop there. The cherry on top is that the CEO, Gerteric Lindquist is paid comparatively modestly to CEOs at similar sized companies. For companies with market capitalizations between kr38b and kr113b, like NIBE Industrier, the median CEO pay is around kr17m.Story continuesThe NIBE Industrier CEO received total compensation of just kr6.3m in the year to December 2018. That looks like modest pay to me, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. While the level of CEO compensation isn't a huge factor in my view of the company, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Should You Add NIBE Industrier To Your Watchlist?As I already mentioned, NIBE Industrier is a growing business, which is what I like to see. Better yet, insiders are significant shareholders, and have been buying more shares. That makes the company a prime candidate for my watchlist - and arguably a research priority. Of course, just because NIBE Industrier is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.The good news is that NIBE Industrier is not the only growth stock with insider buying.
