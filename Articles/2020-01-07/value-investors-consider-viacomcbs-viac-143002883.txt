After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put ViacomCBS Inc. VIAC stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, ViacomCBS has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8.32, as you can see in the chart below:View photos This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.19. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, ViacomCBS’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.View photos Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.41. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. View photosStory continues We should also point out that ViacomCBS has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 6.76, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for ViacomCBS stock in the near term too.    P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings. Right now, ViacomCBS has a P/S ratio of about 1.02. This is higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.49 right now.  Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. View photos If anything, VIAC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of overvalued trading—at least compared to historical norms. Broad Value Outlook In aggregate, ViacomCBS currently has a Zacks Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ViacomCBS a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.  For example, the PEG ratio for ViacomCBS is just 0.60, a level that is lower than the industry average of 0.97. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, VIAC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall? Though ViacomCBS might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of B. This gives VIAC a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>) Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current year has seen twelve estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the full year 2020 estimate has seen eight downward revision compared to ten upward in the same time period.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 9.8% in the past two months, while the full year 2020 estimate has increased by 10.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:ViacomCBS Inc. Price and Consensus View photosCBS Corporation Price and ConsensusMoreViacomCBS  price-consensus-chart | CBS Corporation QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom Line  ViacomCBS is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front. A strong industry rank (among top 38% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #2 further instils our confidence.However, over the past two years, the Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:View photos So, value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
