Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.While Rapala VMC's 2.2% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. During the year, the company also conducted a buyback equivalent to around 24% of its market capitalisation. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Rapala VMC for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis HLSE:RAP1V Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Rapala VMC paid out 85% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Paying out a majority of its earnings limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate a commitment to paying a dividend, or a dearth of investment opportunities.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. The company paid out 53% of its free cash flow, which is not bad per se, but does start to limit the amount of cash Rapala VMC has available to meet other needs. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Is Rapala VMC's Balance Sheet Risky?As Rapala VMC has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 4.85 times its EBITDA, investors are starting to take on a meaningful amount of risk, should the business enter a downturn.We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 12.40 times its interest expense, Rapala VMC's interest cover is quite strong - more than enough to cover the interest expense.We update our data on Rapala VMC every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Rapala VMC's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €0.19 in 2010, compared to €0.06 last year. This works out to a decline of approximately 68% over that time.Story continuesA shrinking dividend over a ten-year period is not ideal, and we'd be concerned about investing in a dividend stock that lacks a solid record of growing dividends per share.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. Rapala VMC's earnings per share have shrunk at 26% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective, as even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Rapala VMC's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Rapala VMC's is paying out more than half its income as dividends, but at least the dividend is covered by both reported earnings and cashflow. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and its dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Overall, Rapala VMC falls short in several key areas here. Unless the investor has strong grounds for an alternative conclusion, we find it hard to get interested in a dividend stock with these characteristics.See if management have their own wealth at stake, by checking insider shareholdings in Rapala VMC stock.Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
