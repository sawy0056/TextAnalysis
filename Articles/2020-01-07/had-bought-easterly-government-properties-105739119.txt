But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. To wit, the Easterly Government Properties, Inc. (NYSE:DEA) share price is 46% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 27% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! However, the longer term returns haven't been so impressive, with the stock up just 19% in the last three years. View our latest analysis for Easterly Government Properties While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over the last twelve months, Easterly Government Properties actually shrank its EPS by 18%.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, it seems likely that investors are putting more weight on metrics other than EPS, at the moment.We haven't seen Easterly Government Properties increase dividend payments yet, so the yield probably hasn't helped drive the share higher. Rather, we'd posit that the revenue increase of 41% might be more meaningful. After all, it's not necessarily a bad thing if a business sacrifices profits today in pursuit of profit tomorrow (metaphorically speaking).The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:DEA Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Easterly Government Properties's TSR for the last year was 53%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectivePleasingly, Easterly Government Properties's total shareholder return last year was 53%. That includes the value of the dividend. That gain actually surpasses the 11% TSR it generated (per year) over three years. These improved returns may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
