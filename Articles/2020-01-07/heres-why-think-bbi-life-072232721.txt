And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in BBI Life Sciences (HKG:1035).

That makes it extra important to check on its balance sheet strength.Are BBI Life Sciences Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I always like to check up on CEO compensation, because I think that reasonable pay levels, around or below the median, can be a sign that shareholder interests are well considered. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like BBI Life Sciences with market caps between CN¥697m and CN¥2.8b is about CN¥2.1m.The CEO of BBI Life Sciences only received CN¥518k in total compensation for the year ending December 2018. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance, that arrangement seems generous to shareholders, and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Is BBI Life Sciences Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for BBI Life Sciences is that it is growing EPS.
