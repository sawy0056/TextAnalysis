(CVE:GPV) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 16% in the last month. But over the last three years we've seen a quite serious decline. Regrettably, the share price slid 58% in that period. So it's good to see it climbing back up. After all, could be that the fall was overdone. Check out our latest analysis for GreenPower Motor Given that GreenPower Motor didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.In the last three years, GreenPower Motor saw its revenue grow by 93% per year, compound. That's well above most other pre-profit companies. The share price has moved in quite the opposite direction, down 25% over that time, a bad result. It seems likely that the market is worried about the continual losses. When we see revenue growth, paired with a falling share price, we can't help wonder if there is an opportunity for those who are willing to dig deeper.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).TSXV:GPV Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months.
