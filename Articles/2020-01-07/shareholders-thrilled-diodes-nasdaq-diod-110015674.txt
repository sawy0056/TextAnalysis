But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For example, the Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ:DIOD) share price has soared 121% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! Also pleasing for shareholders was the 38% gain in the last three months. Check out our latest analysis for Diodes There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance.
