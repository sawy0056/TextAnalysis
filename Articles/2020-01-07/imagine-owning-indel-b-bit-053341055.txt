When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Unfortunately the Indel B S.p.A. (BIT:INDB) share price slid 11% over twelve months. That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 25%. Because Indel B hasn't been listed for many years, the market is still learning about how the business performs. See our latest analysis for Indel B In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Even though the Indel B share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the the market had expectations of much higher growth, last year. But looking to other metrics might better explain the share price change.Indel B's revenue is actually up 6.4% over the last year. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).BIT:INDB Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreIf you are thinking of buying or selling Indel B stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Indel B, it has a TSR of -8.1% for the last year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveGiven that the market gained 25% in the last year, Indel B shareholders might be miffed that they lost 8.1% (even including dividends) . While the aim is to do better than that, it's worth recalling that even great long-term investments sometimes underperform for a year or more. It's great to see a nice little 4.5% rebound in the last three months. Let's just hope this isn't the widely-feared 'dead cat bounce' (which would indicate further declines to come). Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Indel B's dividend track record.
