A patented coating that’s applied during the glass manufacturing process, Kastus is scientifically proven to eliminate up to 99.99% of harmful bacteria including MRSA, E. coli and C. diff, delivering antimicrobial protection to all glass and touchscreen surfaces for life.Story continuesPowered by the patented Kastus® Intelligent Surface Technology™, this invisible coating also transforms glass into an easy-clean surface, reducing the need for chemical cleaners while providing antimicrobial protection. Once ‘baked in’ to the glass surface, the coating technology is incredibly durable, plus being non-leaching it is also friendly to the environment.Kastus uses a unique Photo-physical coating process fuelled by ambient air moisture and light, both unlimited fuel resources. The reactive oxygen species generated on surfaces by our patented process, effectively ‘bash’ the bacteria, disrupting its cell wall until it’s eliminated. The game changer here, is that bacteria cannot build up a resistance or immunity to Kastus coating technology and as the fuel source is unlimited, the protective antimicrobial power is ‘always on’ through the lifetime of the product.To find out more about Kastus visit www.kastus.comTo view the Kastus Brand and Tech video click here brand video link.Media Contacts:ZAGG BrandsJeff DuBois801-506-7336jeff.dubois@ZAGG.com KastusMichelle O’Brien +353 1 5241681info@kastus.comTwo photos accompanying this announcement are available at:https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3827746a-1457-40fd-bdf7-ec03c3ebbf60https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a7d69e98-e23f-4ae2-b4ac-81329ae8d8e3ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
