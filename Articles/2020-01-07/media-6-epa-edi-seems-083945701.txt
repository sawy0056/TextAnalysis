What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital. So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Media 6 SA (EPA:EDI) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Media 6 How Much Debt Does Media 6 Carry?As you can see below, at the end of March 2019, Media 6 had €5.01m of debt, up from €6.0 a year ago. Click the image for more detail. But it also has €20.5m in cash to offset that, meaning it has €15.5m net cash.ENXTPA:EDI Historical Debt, January 6th 2020MoreHow Strong Is Media 6's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Media 6 had liabilities of €24.1m falling due within a year, and liabilities of €7.88m due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had €20.5m in cash and €17.5m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast €6.10m more liquid assets than total liabilities.This excess liquidity suggests that Media 6 is taking a careful approach to debt. Because it has plenty of assets, it is unlikely to have trouble with its lenders. Simply put, the fact that Media 6 has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.Also positive, Media 6 grew its EBIT by 24% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is Media 6's earnings that will influence how the balance sheet holds up in the future. So if you're keen to discover more about its earnings, it might be worth checking out this graph of its long term earnings trend.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. Media 6 may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Media 6 recorded free cash flow worth 70% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Summing upWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Media 6 has €15.5m in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And we liked the look of last year's 24% year-on-year EBIT growth. So we don't think Media 6's use of debt is risky. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all.
