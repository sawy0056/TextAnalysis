But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term Northgate plc (LON:NTG) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 48% over a half decade. View our latest analysis for Northgate To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Looking back five years, both Northgate's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 2.9% per year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 12% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 8.65.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).LSE:NTG Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreWe know that Northgate has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Northgate the TSR over the last 5 years was -36%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Northgate had a tough year, with a total loss of 11% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 20%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8.4% over the last half decade. We realise that Buffett has said investors should 'buy when there is blood on the streets', but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality businesses.
