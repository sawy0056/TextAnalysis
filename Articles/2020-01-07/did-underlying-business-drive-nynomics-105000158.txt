While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. To wit, the Nynomic AG (ETR:M7U) share price has soared 380% over five years. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. It's also good to see the share price up 18% over the last quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 9.6% in the last three months. See our latest analysis for Nynomic While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years of share price growth, Nynomic moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the Nynomic share price has gained 127% in three years. During the same period, EPS grew by 17% each year. This EPS growth is lower than the 31% average annual increase in the share price over three years. So one can reasonably conclude the market is more enthusiastic about the stock than it was three years ago.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).XTRA:M7U Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Nynomic's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveNynomic shareholders gained a total return of 3.3% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 37% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. Is Nynomic cheap compared to other companies?
