To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Middlesex Water:0.044 = US$34m ÷ (US$887m - US$103m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Middlesex Water has an ROCE of 4.4%. Check out our latest analysis for Middlesex Water Is Middlesex Water's ROCE Good?One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies.

Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Middlesex Water has total liabilities of US$103m and total assets of US$887m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 12% of its total assets. With a very reasonable level of current liabilities, so the impact on ROCE is fairly minimal.The Bottom Line On Middlesex Water's ROCEMiddlesex Water has a poor ROCE, and there may be better investment prospects out there.
