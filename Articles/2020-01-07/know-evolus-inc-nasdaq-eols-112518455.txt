(NASDAQ:EOLS) Insiders Have Been Buying SharesSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosWe've lost count of how many times insiders have accumulated shares in a company that goes on to improve markedly. Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So before you buy or sell Evolus, Inc. (NASDAQ:EOLS), you may well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling.Do Insider Transactions Matter?It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. Check out our latest analysis for Evolus The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At EvolusOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman of the Board Vikram Malik for US$25m worth of shares, at about US$19.25 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$11.57 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 1.97m shares for US$38m. But insiders sold 2612 shares worth US$35k. Overall, Evolus insiders were net buyers last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 7.5% of Evolus shares, worth about US$29m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The Evolus Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Evolus insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us.
