She also did not say if there were any Lebanese nationals in Japan wanted in Lebanon.RED NOTICEAccording to a Lebanese judicial source, Lebanon has yet to receive a formal notice from Interpol requesting Ghosn's arrest and will not take any steps until it does.The source said on Monday that the so-called red notice it received last week had been sent directly from Japan rather than via Interpol's headquarters in Lyon, France."There are questions in Wiesbaden and Lyon over the legality of sending the notification directly from Tokyo to Lebanon without passing through Interpol headquarters," the source said, referring to Interpol offices.When Lebanon has received red notices in the past, suspects have not been detained but their passports have been confiscated and bail has been set, a judicial source said last week.Mori offered little insight into the events of Ghosn's escape to his ancestral home, repeatedly saying she could not comment on specifics because of an ongoing investigation.Japanese officials broke days of silence about the Ghosn case on Sunday, saying they would tighten immigration measures and investigate his escape thoroughly. The authorities have also issued an international notice for his arrest.Mori also defended Japan's justice system against Ghosn's charges that it was "rigged" and discriminatory.In Japan, suspects who deny charges against them are often detained for long periods and subject to lengthy questioning without a lawyer present, a system critics call "hostage justice"."Various comments about Japan's justice system and this unjust departure are two different things," Mori told reporters, saying criticism of the justice system could not be used to justify Ghosn's escape."Departure in an unjust way without proper procedure is tantamount to smuggling, an illegal departure amounting to a crime."(Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka and Kevin Buckland; Additional reporting by Laila Bassam in Beirut; Writing by David Dolan and Eric Knecht; Editing by Christopher Cushing and David Clarke)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergJapan scrambles for workarounds after Abe urges March school shutdown to stem coronavirusReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
