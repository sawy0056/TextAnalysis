(Sanan IC), a pure-play wafer foundry with its advanced compound semiconductor technology platform, today announced its recognition of Plextek RFI, a UK-based design house specializing in RF microwave and millimeter-wave circuit designs, as an authorized resource for gallium arsenide (GaAs) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) design services in the emerging 5G market. The effectiveness of this collaboration has been demonstrated by the recent design by Plextek RFI of a single-chip surface mount packaged 4-channel 5G millimeter wave power amplifier (PA) for the 28GHz spectrum using Sanan IC’s P15EP1 0.15µm 6” GaAs E/D pHEMT process technology. The reference design was displayed and presented by Plextek RFI at the recent Automated RF and Microwave Measurement Society (ARMMS) Conference held in Bedfordshire, UK.“As the 5G infrastructure market expands from sub-6GHz into the millimeter-wave spectrum, RF front-end design activities for the associated telecoms equipment are naturally increasing,” said Raymond Cai, Chief Executive Officer of Sanan IC. “We are pleased to have Plextek RFI as an authorized design services partner, to assist our customers worldwide in augmenting their GaAs IC design and development resources with RF engineering expertise. We anticipate that our newly launched P15EP1 E/D pHEMT GaAs process will be widely adopted in high-performance millimeter-wave applications, particularly in the 5G space.”“The roll-out of 5G infrastructure has generated demand for a variety of millimeter-wave RF front-end architectures and topologies that require high performance GaAs IC designs,” commented Plextek RFI Chief Executive Officer Liam Devlin. “We are delighted to provide our clients innovative solutions and design options to address these requirements, as demonstrated by our compact, multi-channel power amplifier reference design on Sanan IC GaAs technology. We expect to build on this success by leveraging other Sanan IC GaAs processes and exploiting its future roadmap for high-performance, high integration, and high quality RF designs.”The company’s P15EP1 process is a high-performance 6” GaAs pHEMT technology, highly integrated with E-mode, 0.15µm gate length transistors which have an Ft of 85GHz and Fmax of 155GHz. The process is ideal for millimeter-wave PA and LNA designs, offering excellent gain, low noise figure, and wide bandwidth, and can be combined with 0.5µm E-mode/D-mode devices for single-die logic implementation. This technology platform provides up to 3 metal interconnect layers, with 12 mask layers with and a back lapping thickness of 75µm. The P15EP1 process is part of the P15 family of GaAs technologies, which can provide other options such as D-mode transistors, PIN diodes for switches and limiters, and which will be augmented later next year with a lower process node for higher frequency support.For more information on the company’s III-V semiconductor technology manufacturing platform, Sanan IC is available to meet at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week on January 7-10.About Sanan ICSanan Integrated Circuit Co., Ltd.
