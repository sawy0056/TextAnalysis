But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. To wit, the Blackstone Minerals Limited (ASX:BSX) share price is 55% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 19% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. Note that businesses generally develop over the long term, so the returns over the last year might not reflect a long term trend. See our latest analysis for Blackstone Minerals Blackstone Minerals recorded just AU$100,980 in revenue over the last twelve months, which isn't really enough for us to consider it to have a proven product. So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. For example, investors may be hoping that Blackstone Minerals finds some valuable resources, before it runs out of money.As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some such companies do very well over the long term, others become hyped up by promoters before eventually falling back down to earth, and going bankrupt (or being recapitalized). Blackstone Minerals has already given some investors a taste of the sweet gains that high risk investing can generate, if your timing is right.When it reported in June 2019 Blackstone Minerals had minimal cash in excess of all liabilities consider its expenditure: just AU$13k to be specific. So if it has not already moved to replenish reserves, we think the near-term chances of a capital raising event are pretty high. Given how low on cash the it got, investors must really like its potential for the share price to be up 122% in the last year .
