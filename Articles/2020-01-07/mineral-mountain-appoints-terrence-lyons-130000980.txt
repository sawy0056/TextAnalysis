The Standby Gold Project and its Rochford area contiguous land holdings cover in excess of 7,500 acres. Five major trends of structurally thickened auriferous iron formation geologically comparable to the Ledge -type gold mineralization developed at the Homestake Mine which produced over 40 million ounces of gold offer above average potential to host a large gold resource.Along one of the five major trends, drilling on the 100%-owned Standby Mine Property to date has partially defined a gold-bearing, arsenopyrite-pyrrhotite mineralized, near-vertical shear zone in iron formation, approximately 30 m wide, striking 129 degrees Azimuth, in structurally thickened iron formation which comprises a tight isoclinal, steeply dipping closed anticlinal structure forming the eastern limb of the Standby Syncline. This structure, the East Limb Structure, based on the Company's comprehensive database and the 2018 and 2019 drilling to date confirms that this gold mineralization also extends down-plunge for at least 1.5 kilometers. In 1987, Homestake drilled SM87-3A which intersected
3.1 m @ 10.29 g/t Au within a broader gold zone 1.5 km down plunge.Story continuesThe Company's Phase 1 drill campaign completed in 2018 consisted of nine (9) holes totaling 2,937 meters (9,637 feet). This program was successful in intersecting broad intervals of economic "Upper Tail" gold mineralization within the East Limb Structure to about 500m down plunge from the historical Standby Mine. The "Upper Tail" gold mineralization from surface to 500 meters down plunge averages 24 m in width with grades up to 3.36 g/t Au but locally with high-grade gold concentrations of up to 9.80 g/t Au occurring within classic Homestake-style quartz vein-hydrothermal chlorite breccia with quartz flooding, 3-15% coarse-grained arsenopyrite and 3-7% pyrrhotite.A directional drill program was initiated in early October to test the down plunge length of the East Limb Structure. Based on 3D modelling of the Company's airborne magnetics, surface geological mapping and the control provided by several historic deep holes completed by Homestake Mining in 1986-87, this structure is of sufficient scale (i.e. multi-kilometer plunge length of structurally thickened, sheared iron formation) to host a major gold resource.The Company's primary focus in early 2020 will be to define the limits of Target 1 down dip and  along strike with several short offset holes cutting across the East Limb Structure supported by downhole EM and to test the high gold mineralization intersected by Homestake in 1986 at approximately 1500 m down plunge.On Behalf of the Board of DirectorsMINERAL MOUNTAIN RESOURCES LTD."Nelson W.
