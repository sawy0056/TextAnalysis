And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Huber+Suhner (VTX:HUBN). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. See our latest analysis for Huber+Suhner How Fast Is Huber+Suhner Growing?As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Huber+Suhner grew its EPS by 9.1% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth.

As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own Huber+Suhner shares worth a considerable sum. Notably, they have an enormous stake in the company, worth CHF295m. Coming in at 20% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.Does Huber+Suhner Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As I already mentioned, Huber+Suhner is a growing business, which is what I like to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination appeals to me, for one. So yes, I do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Huber+Suhner is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Although Huber+Suhner certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
