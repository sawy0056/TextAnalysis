DVYE, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones Emerging Markets Select Dividend Index.The Dow Jones Emerging Markets Select Dividend Index measures the performance of the companies in emerging market countries that have provided relatively high dividend yields on a consistent basis over time.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.49%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 5.96%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.When you look at individual holdings, Astral Foods Ltd (ARL) accounts for about 2.33% of the fund's total assets, followed by Nanya Technology Corp and Severstal (CHMF).DVYE's top 10 holdings account for about 19.42% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, DVYE return is roughly 0.15%, and was up about 14.85% in the last one year (as of 01/06/2020). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $36.90 and $42.09.DVYE has a beta of 0.78 and standard deviation of 13.59% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 118 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Emerging Markets Dividend ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Emerging Market ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are other ETFs in the space which investors should consider.IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has $62.06 B in assets, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has $67.20 B. IEMG has an expense ratio of 0.14% and VWO charges 0.12%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Emerging Market ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
