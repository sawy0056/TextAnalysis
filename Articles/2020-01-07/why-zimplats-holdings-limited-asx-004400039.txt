Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Zimplats Holdings:0.16 = US$215m ÷ (US$1.5b - US$136m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Zimplats Holdings has an ROCE of 16%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. Given the industry it operates in, Zimplats Holdings could be considered cyclical.

The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Zimplats Holdings has total assets of US$1.5b and current liabilities of US$136m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 9.0% of its total assets. Low current liabilities have only a minimal impact on Zimplats Holdings's ROCE, making its decent returns more credible.Story continuesOur Take On Zimplats Holdings's ROCEThis is good to see, and while better prospects may exist, Zimplats Holdings seems worth researching further.
