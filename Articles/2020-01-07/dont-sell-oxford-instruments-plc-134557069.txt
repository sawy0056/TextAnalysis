We'll look at Oxford Instruments plc's (LON:OXIG) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Based on the last twelve months, Oxford Instruments's P/E ratio is 26.14. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying £26.14 for every £1 in prior year profit. Check out our latest analysis for Oxford Instruments How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Oxford Instruments:P/E of 26.14 = £15.54 ÷ £0.59 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Oxford Instruments Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. As you can see below, Oxford Instruments has a higher P/E than the average company (21.5) in the electronic industry.LSE:OXIG Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreOxford Instruments's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Oxford Instruments's 84% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. The cherry on top is that the five year growth rate was an impressive 39% per year. So I'd be surprised if the P/E ratio was not above average.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting Oxford Instruments's P/E?The extra options and safety that comes with Oxford Instruments's UK£14m net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.The Bottom Line On Oxford Instruments's P/E RatioOxford Instruments's P/E is 26.1 which is above average (18.3) in its market. Its net cash position is the cherry on top of its superb EPS growth. To us, this is the sort of company that we would expect to carry an above average price tag (relative to earnings).Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
