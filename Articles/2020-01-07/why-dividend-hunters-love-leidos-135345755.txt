(NYSE:LDOS)Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosIs Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LDOS) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.With a 1.4% yield and a eight-year payment history, investors probably think Leidos Holdings looks like a reliable dividend stock. A 1.4% yield is not inspiring, but the longer payment history has some appeal. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 4.8% of market capitalisation this year. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Leidos Holdings! NYSE:LDOS Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Leidos Holdings paid out 28% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Leidos Holdings paid out 18% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservative and suggests the dividend is sustainable. It's positive to see that Leidos Holdings's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Is Leidos Holdings's Balance Sheet Risky?As Leidos Holdings has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). Leidos Holdings has net debt of 2.31 times its EBITDA. Using debt can accelerate business growth, but also increases the risks.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Leidos Holdings has EBIT of 6.20 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Leidos Holdings's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Looking at the last decade of data, we can see that Leidos Holdings paid its first dividend at least eight years ago. Although it has been paying a dividend for several years now, the dividend has been cut at least once by more than 20%, and we're cautious about the consistency of its dividend across a full economic cycle. During the past eight-year period, the first annual payment was US$1.92 in 2012, compared to US$1.36 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 4.2% a year during that period. Leidos Holdings's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 4.2% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.Story continuesA shrinking dividend over a eight-year period is not ideal, and we'd be concerned about investing in a dividend stock that lacks a solid record of growing dividends per share.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Leidos Holdings has grown its earnings per share at 37% per annum over the past five years. With high earnings per share growth in recent times and a modest payout ratio, we think this is an attractive combination if earnings can be reinvested to generate further growth.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Leidos Holdings's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Firstly, we like that Leidos Holdings has low and conservative payout ratios. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, but it was concerning to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. All things considered, Leidos Holdings looks like a strong prospect. At the right valuation, it could be something special.Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
