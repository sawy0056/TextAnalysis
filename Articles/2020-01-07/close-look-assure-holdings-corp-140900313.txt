(CVE:IOM) to see whether it might be an attractive investment prospect. To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Assure Holdings:0.15 = US$5.8m ÷ (US$44m - US$6.2m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Assure Holdings has an ROCE of 15%.

To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Assure Holdings has total assets of US$44m and current liabilities of US$6.2m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 14% of its total assets.
