(LON:MWE) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.While M.T.I Wireless Edge's 2.8% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding M.T.I Wireless Edge for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis AIM:MWE Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 46% of M.T.I Wireless Edge's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Of the free cash flow it generated last year, M.T.I Wireless Edge paid out 33% as dividends, suggesting the dividend is affordable. It's positive to see that M.T.I Wireless Edge's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.With a strong net cash balance, M.T.I Wireless Edge investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Consider getting
our latest analysis on M.T.I Wireless Edge's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of M.T.I Wireless Edge's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.012 in 2010, compared to US$0.015 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.6% a year over that time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments, we don't think this is an attractive combination.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see M.T.I Wireless Edge has grown its earnings per share at 34% per annum over the past five years. With high earnings per share growth in recent times and a modest payout ratio, we think this is an attractive combination if earnings can be reinvested to generate further growth.Story continuesConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that M.T.I Wireless Edge's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Firstly, we like that M.T.I Wireless Edge has low and conservative payout ratios. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Overall we think M.T.I Wireless Edge scores well on our analysis. It's not quite perfect, but we'd definitely be keen to take a closer look.Are management backing themselves to deliver performance?
