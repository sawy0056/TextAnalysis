To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Nilörngruppen:0.29 = kr77m ÷ (kr453m - kr188m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Nilörngruppen has an ROCE of 29%. See our latest analysis for Nilörngruppen Is Nilörngruppen's ROCE Good?One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies. Using our data, we find that Nilörngruppen's ROCE is meaningfully better than the 8.9% average in the Luxury industry.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Do Nilörngruppen's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Short term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Nilörngruppen has total liabilities of kr188m and total assets of kr453m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 41% of its total assets. Nilörngruppen has a medium level of current liabilities, boosting its ROCE somewhat.The Bottom Line On Nilörngruppen's ROCEEven so, it has a great ROCE, and could be an attractive prospect for further research.
