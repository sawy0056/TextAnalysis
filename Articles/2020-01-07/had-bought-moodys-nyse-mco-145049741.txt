But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) stock is up an impressive 157% over the last five years. It's also good to see the share price up 16% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 11% in 90 days). See our latest analysis for Moody's To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Moody's achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.9% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).NYSE:MCO Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreWe know that Moody's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Moody's's TSR for the last 5 years was 173%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Moody's has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 70% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 22% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
