Last December, it had completed the acquisition of the Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies business of TransDigm Group Incorporated TDG for $920 million.This acquisition will expand Eaton’s presence in the growing market for electrical content on aircraft. Also, the move perfectly fits in with its strategy of providing broad electrical expertise to new markets.Wide Market ReachEaton sells products in a number of markets and faces a wide array of competitors in varied niches. The quality of products supplied by the company enables it to retain strong market position.
