Provides Regulatory Update on VAZALOREGlobeNewswireJanuary 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShare-- PLx Aligning with the FDA on Data Requirements for VAZALORE -- FDA Approves Labeling for 325 mg -- -- Expect to Launch VAZALORE in late 2020 --SPARTA, N.J., Jan. 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PLx Pharma Inc. (PLXP) (“PLx” or the “Company”), a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company initially focused on developing its clinically validated and patent-protected PLxGuard™ delivery system to provide more effective and safer products, VAZALORE™ 325 mg and VAZALORE™ 81 mg (referred to together as “VAZALORE”™), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is providing clarification for the regulatory path forward for VAZALORE.Over the last year, the Company has refined and optimized its formulation, resulting in a high-quality and stable product. VAZALORE will deliver better absorption and improved GI safety for millions of patients at a high risk for cardiovascular events. In the Company’s recent interactions with the FDA, PLx agreed to provide some additional data on VAZALORE 325 mg dose strength to bridge the new formulation to the original approved formulation, and expects to meet with the FDA to finalize the data modeling components shortly. In addition, PLx gained alignment with the FDA on the necessary data required for approval for the 81 mg dose. PLx anticipates completing the data modeling and the submissions for both the 325 mg and 81 mg simultaneously in the second quarter of 2020. It is projected that this will shift the timing of the launch of both dosages of VAZALORE in the United States towards the end of 2020.Additionally, the FDA has approved updated labeling for 325 mg dose strength, and the Company will apply the approved 325 mg labeling to the 81 mg labeling in the CMC submission planned for second quarter 2020.“We believe this valuable feedback from the FDA will result in a stronger submission with a higher likelihood of approval. The approval of our labeling for VAZALORE 325 mg is a great accomplishment and is vital to our continuing commercialization efforts,” said Natasha Giordano, President and Chief Executive Officer of PLx Pharma.About VAZALORE VAZALORE 325 mg is an FDA-approved aspirin product being developed to provide patients with vascular disease and diabetic patients who are candidates for aspirin therapy with more reliable and predictable antiplatelet efficacy as compared to enteric-coated aspirin, while also reducing the adverse gastric events common in an acute setting. PLx is focused on manufacturing, scale-up and label finalization for VAZALORE 325 mg aspirin dosage form and preparing an sNDA for VAZALORE 81 mg maintenance dose form. Our goal is to begin selling both products in the United States towards the end of 2020, subject to approval by the FDA.About PLx Pharma Inc.PLx Pharma Inc. is a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing its clinically validated and patent-protected PLxGuard™ delivery system to provide more effective and safer products.
