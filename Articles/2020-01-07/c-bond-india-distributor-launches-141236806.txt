The product is sprayed directly onto a windshield and then wiped off using a squeegee. The strengthening process begins immediately upon application and continues while the material cures in the following days.C-Bond NanoShield and C-Bond NanoShield Plus are tested and validated to strengthen glass through a patent-pending nanotechnology emulsion that increases impact resistance. C-Bond NanoShield Plus features the same glass strengthening technology as C-Bond NanoShield and contains a hydrophobic to help improve driver visibility and reaction times in wet weather conditions. “Our international presence is growing as we continue to work with distributors around the world who see the value proposition of C-Bond NanoShield,” said Scott R. Silverman, C-Bond’s Chairman and CEO. “C-Bond NanoShield is a great complement to Quantron’s automotive product portfolio.”C-Bond’s glass strengthening technology is protected by 23 patents and patent pending applications.  The C-Bond solution increases the mechanical properties of the window glass unit, enabling the glass to dissipate higher energy by targeting and repairing the microscopic flaws and defects that are randomly distributed naturally on the glass surface.  These surface imperfections weaken the glass composite structure and initiate failures.  C-Bond chemically bonds to the defects increasing both strength and flexibility. About QuantronQuantron is a high value-added distribution company engaged in distribution of products in multiple verticals and is a pioneer in taking novel products to the Indian and South Asian market with custom supply-chain solutions, marketing and localized repackaging solutions.
