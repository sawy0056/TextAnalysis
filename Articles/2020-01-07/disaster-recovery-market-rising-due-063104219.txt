The market is also deemed to record a stunning growth rate of 44% between 2017 and 2023, which is the forecast period.Disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) helps facilitate business continuity during cases of system failure. These solutions feature cross-cloud infrastructure management, cross-platform health monitoring and hybrid cloud availability monitoring. The increasing need to back up public as well as private data is believed to be one of the prime reasons for the strong growth of the global disaster recovery as a service market.It is estimated that close to 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced every day, and the main cause of loss of this data is sudden downtime of systems that leads to the shutdown of a number of companies. The potential damage incurred during system failures or downtimes is massive and thereby calls for effective backup services. Backup services help companies gain foresight of any unforeseen disasters and prove to be an integral aspect of data safety; a factor that helps with the growth of the DRaaS market. For example, as per studies conducted in the year 2017, not more than 10% of the companies are able to deal with any disaster without any disaster recovery backup. These companies are not only the small sized ones but also major players like Nissan and FedEx among others.Given the surge in the number of cyber threats, a number of companies have started deploying AI as well as Machine Learning in DRaaS solutions for threat detection or any unusual behavior. Predictive learning algorithms are being used to identify real or false disaster recovery situations. These also help automatically conduct proactive recoveries and curb outages much before being detected.Get a Free Sample @ https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/sample_request/3230Segmentation:The market segments for disaster recovery as a service include service type, service provider, deployment and vertical.The service types covered in the report are data security, real-time replication, professional services, backup, system integration, support & maintenance, and training & consulting.Depending on the service provider, the global disaster recovery as a service market includes managed service provider, telecom & communication service provider, cloud service provider, and others.The disaster recovery as a service market, deployment-wise, comprises public, hybrid and private.Vertical-based segments in the disaster recovery as a service market are healthcare, BFSI, governments, retail, manufacturing, IT & telecommunication, media, and others.Regional Insight The geographical classification of the disaster recovery as a service market includes North America, Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, and the Rest of the World (RoW).As of now, North America holds the top position in the global market for disaster recovery as a service and has the potential to maintain its supremacy throughout the review period.
