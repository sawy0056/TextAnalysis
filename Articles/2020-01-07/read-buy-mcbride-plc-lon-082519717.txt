We'll show how you can use McBride plc's (LON:MCB) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. McBride has a P/E ratio of 12.70, based on the last twelve months. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying £12.70 for every £1 in prior year profit. View our latest analysis for McBride How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for McBride:P/E of 12.70 = £0.83 ÷ £0.07 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.How Does McBride's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (19.2) for companies in the household products industry is higher than McBride's P/E.LSE:MCB Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreMcBride's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with McBride, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.McBride saw earnings per share decrease by 37% last year. And over the longer term (3 years) earnings per share have decreased 11% annually. This growth rate might warrant a low P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).McBride's Balance SheetNet debt totals 80% of McBride's market cap. This is a reasonably significant level of debt -- all else being equal you'd expect a much lower P/E than if it had net cash.The Verdict On McBride's P/E RatioMcBride's P/E is 12.7 which is below average (18.3) in the GB market. When you consider that the company has significant debt, and didn't grow EPS last year, it isn't surprising that the market has muted expectations.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. So this free visual report on analyst forecasts could hold the key to an excellent investment decision.But note: McBride may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20).Story continuesIf you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
