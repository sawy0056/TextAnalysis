This is especially true as a U.S. drone strike in Iraq that has killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani has ratcheted up tensions between Washington and Tehran leading to investors’ flight to safety.Following the attack, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani said it would no longer abide by any limits on its enrichment of uranium and Iraq’s parliament voted to expel U.S. troops from the country. On the other hand, President Donald Trump threatened Tehran that America will hit Iran "harder than they have ever been hit before" if it carried out retaliatory attacks or expelled U.S. troops from the country. The move has sparked fears of broader conflicts (read: Iraq Attack: Sector ETF Winners and Losers).Against this backdrop, gold is considered a great store of value and hedge against market turmoil.Apart from geopolitics, the latest economic data has made investors’ jittery. The U.S. manufacturing sector fell into its deepest slump in more than a decade in December due to tit-for-tat tariffs in U.S.-China trade war though the long-awaited Phase 1 deal between Washington and Beijing could limit further downside.With this, the yellow metal has entered 2020 with strong momentum and is building on the largest annual gain in almost a decade, which was driven by a weaker dollar, lower interest rates and trade war fears. The central banks across the globe have been on a monetary easing spree that is boosting demand for the yellow metal. The Fed slashed interest rates three times last year and the European Central Bank also cut interest rates in a package of easing measures. Lower rates will continue to weigh on the dollar against the basket of currencies, raising the metal’s attractiveness as it does not pay interest like fixed-income assets.ETFs to TapGiven this, investors could tap the rise in bullion price with the help of ETFs.
