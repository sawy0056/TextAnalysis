(“NIO” or the “Company”) (NIO), a pioneer in China’s premium electric vehicle market, today provided its December 2019 delivery results.NIO delivered 3,170 vehicles in December 2019, representing a robust 25.4% month-over-month growth contributed by strong sales of both the ES6, the Company’s 5-seater high-performance premium electric SUV, and the ES8, the Company’s 7-seater high-performance premium electric SUV and its 6-seater variant. The deliveries consisted of 2,537 ES6s and 633 ES8s, an increase of 22.7% and 37.3% respectively, compared with November 2019. As of December 31, 2019, aggregate deliveries of the ES6 and the ES8 reached 31,913 vehicles, of which 20,565 were delivered in 2019.“December marked the fifth consecutive month of increasing deliveries for NIO despite the continuous softness of the overall auto industry and in particular, the significant decline of the electric vehicle sales in the second half of 2019,” said William Bin Li, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of NIO. “These results are attributable, not only to our products and services that continue to stand out from competition in quality, performance and pricing, but also to our passionate, loyal and supportive user base. Through favorable word of mouth and referrals, our existing users remain a steady and relevant driver of new orders. Our sales also benefited from the expansion of our sales network through the continued launch of more efficient NIO Spaces. With our product offerings further deepened and upgraded in 2020 though the all-new ES8, the 100-kWh battery pack and the upcoming EC6, a 5-seater smart premium electric coupe SUV, we expect our order momentum to continue going forward.”About NIO Inc.
