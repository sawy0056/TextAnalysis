Of the roughly 800 North American stocks we cover, 32% have an overvalued rating of 1 or 2 stars compared with only 21% with an undervalued rating of 4 or 5 stars. Only three of the 11 sectors we cover have a median stock with a price/fair value ratio below 1: energy, consumer cyclical, and communication services.Energy remains the cheapest sector in our coverage. The long-term economics of supply and demand point to oil and natural gas prices of $55 per barrel (West Texas Intermediate) and $2.80 per thousand cubic feet (Nymex)—levels that make many U.S. energy stocks attractive at today's prices.Consumer cyclical stocks also look relatively attractive. Those looking for a bargain in the sector may want to take advantage of the uncertainty plaguing travel and leisure, which trades at a 12% discount to our valuations.Technology stocks were on fire in 2019, and we don't see much value in the sector today. The median U.S. technology stock is 11% overvalued, and we see no subsectors where the median stock is cheap.Energy Continues to Hold the Largest Share of Buying Opportunities - source: MorningstarReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
