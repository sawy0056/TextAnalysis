The first major change to the PCIe interface since 2010, its x16 slot configuration can reach approximately 32 gigabytes per second (GB/s) of data flowing in each direction. By comparison, the previous PCIe 3.0 format maxed out around 16 GB/s. PCIe 4.0 also doubles the bandwidth of servers, creating “superhighways” to increase their data load capacity to 64 GB/s. All of this clears a path for more powerful SSDs.SSSTC expects to ship two PCIe Gen4 SSD models, the CA6 and EA1, one for client and another for the enterprise use, in the second half of the year.“PCIe Gen4 will be a key enabler for organizations trying to stay relevant in the digital age,” said Darlo Perez, Managing Director, Americas region, SSSTC. “Success in today’s constantly changing digital world all depends on how you collect, aggregate and analyze data to gain richer insights into customer behavior. With SSDs built around PCIe 4.0, businesses will be able to store and share critical data much faster and far more efficiently than they ever imagined.”In addition to its PCIe Gen4 announcement at CES, SSSTC also revealed its second generation EDSFF E1.S and E1.L SSDs for data centers and hyperscale environments, providing improved manageability, serviceability, and reduced power efficiency.To learn more about the upcoming SSDs, please contact Christine.hsing@ssstc.com or Mylene.mazza@ssstc.com for an appointment during CES.About Solid State Storage Technology Corporation (SSSTC)A subsidiary of LITE-ON Group, Solid State Storage Technology Corporation is a global leader in the design, development and manufacturing of Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for PC Client, Enterprise, Cloud and Edge Computing, Industrial and Automotive solutions.Available in a variety of interfaces and form factors to deliver the right product for the right application, SSSTC’s SSD solutions are highly customizable using industry-leading key components.
