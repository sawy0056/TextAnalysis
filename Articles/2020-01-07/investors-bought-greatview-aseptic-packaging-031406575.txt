While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Unfortunately the Greatview Aseptic Packaging Company Limited (HKG:468) share price slid 23% over twelve months. That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 14%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 6.1% in that time. It's down 2.7% in the last seven days. See our latest analysis for Greatview Aseptic Packaging In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Even though the Greatview Aseptic Packaging share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.It seems quite likely that the market was expecting higher growth from the stock. But looking to other metrics might better explain the share price change.We don't see any weakness in the Greatview Aseptic Packaging's dividend so the steady payout can't really explain the share price drop. The revenue trend doesn't seem to explain why the share price is down. Unless, of course, the market was expecting a revenue uptick.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:468 Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Greatview Aseptic Packaging, it has a TSR of -17% for the last year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 14% in the last year, Greatview Aseptic Packaging shareholders lost 17% (even including dividends) . However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3.6% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Greatview Aseptic Packaging's dividend track record.
