We'll look at Creative Enterprise Holdings Limited's (HKG:3992) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Creative Enterprise Holdings has a P/E ratio of 20.27. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 4.9%. Check out our latest analysis for Creative Enterprise Holdings How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Creative Enterprise Holdings:P/E of 20.27 = HK$0.92 ÷ HK$0.05 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each HK$1 of company earnings. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does Creative Enterprise Holdings Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (7.0) for companies in the real estate industry is lower than Creative Enterprise Holdings's P/E.SEHK:3992 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreCreative Enterprise Holdings's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Creative Enterprise Holdings saw earnings per share decrease by 55% last year.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Creative Enterprise Holdings's Balance SheetCreative Enterprise Holdings has net cash of HK$76m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Bottom Line On Creative Enterprise Holdings's P/E RatioCreative Enterprise Holdings trades on a P/E ratio of 20.3, which is above its market average of 10.7. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: and the high P/E suggests the market thinks it will.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
