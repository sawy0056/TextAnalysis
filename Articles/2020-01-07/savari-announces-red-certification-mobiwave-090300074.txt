In order to pass this set of tests, the device has to not only successfully execute its mission-mode transmission and reception, but it has to demonstrate that it will not interfere with other radio devices in both the spectral and physical vicinities. Additionally, the device must show that it does not emit spurious radio transmissions in excess of specifications. Finally, compliance with the applicable health and safety requirements must be proven."I am proud that our team was able to complete this difficult and far-reaching radio certification milestone, and show our continuing technical leadership," said Paul Sakamoto, Chief Operating Officer, Savari, Inc."We have had a successful working relationship with Savari for several years and are pleased that they have achieved the RED certification milestone for the MobiWAVE OBU and StreetWAVE RSU platforms, powered by the Qualcomm 9150 C-V2X Platform," said Dino Flore, Vice President, Technology, Qualcomm Europe, Inc.
