However, a tough competitive landscape and foreign exchange uncertainties are likely to offset the positives to some extent.This $1.03-billion worth animal health and mineral nutrition company expects an earnings growth rate of 3.2% for the next five years. Also, the company has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 8.2%, on average.In the past three months, the company’s shares have outperformed the industry. The stock has rallied 18.3% compared with the industry’s 4.9% growth.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Diversified Product Portfolio: Phibro’s key animal health products, including MFAs and nutritional specialty products, are expected to continue driving growth in the long term. The company’s leading product franchise, Stafac/V-Max/Eskalin, is approved in more than 30 countries for use in poultry and swine and regarded as one of the leading MFA products for livestock. Similarly, the company’s nutritional product offerings, such as OmniGen-AF, are being used increasingly in the global dairy industry. Foray in Emerging Markets: Phibro’s existing operations and established sales, marketing and distribution network in more than 65 countries provide it ample scope to take advantage of global growth opportunities. Outside the United States, the company’s global footprint extends to key high-growth regions, including South America, the Asia Pacific, Russia and former CIS countries, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, Canada and South Africa.Prospering Vaccine Business: Lately, Phibro has been inking deals with various companies to bolster its vaccine business. In December 2018, the company bought the assets of KoVax, an Israel-based developer and manufacturer of vaccines for the international aquaculture market. The buyout has widened Phibro’s portfolio of aquaculture products.However, a few factors are affecting the company’s growth.Competitive Headwinds:Phibro faces tough competition from key market rivals like Bayer AG, Ceva Santé Animale, Boehringer Ingelheim International GMBH, Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco Animal Health), Huvepharma Inc., Lallemand Inc., Merck & Co., Inc.
