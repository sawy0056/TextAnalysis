An intraoral scanner is a handheld digital device that captures images of the teeth and bite structure and simultaneously displays them on a screen to be viewed by both Dr. HagShenas and the patient. The ability to see what the doctor sees helps patients more fully and comfortably understand their current oral health and the procedures needed.The Carestream intraoral camera is an advanced piece of technology that makes capturing detailed digital images fast and easy. Patients no longer need to experience goopy, gag-inducing impressions, as the intraoral scanner is a minimally invasive handheld device. Images are captured instantly and displayed on a monitor visible to both the dentist and the patient. This makes treatment planning and workflow significantly more streamlined. By using the Carestream intraoral scanner, Dr. HagShenas and his patients gain many benefits, including: Real-time view of teeth Accurate digital image captures No goopy, gag-inducing impressions Quick results Better patient education Improved treatment planningPatient education is important to Dr. HagShenas. He wants to assure that patients have a clear understanding of restorative dentistry procedures, oral concerns and what can be improved. When patients are able to see exactly what the doctor sees during their impressions, they more fully understand the extent of their oral health. Dr. Hagshenas is then able to better explain patient needs and treatment methods, as well as stress the importance of proper oral healthcare routines.The Carestream intraoral scanner is often used for those who need full mouth dental implants to replace an entire mouth of missing or failing teeth. Both a functional and restorative dentistry solution, full mouth dental implants utilize as few as four implants to secure a lifelike arch of teeth to the jaw. This treatment allows patients to enjoy the benefits of a fully functional and aesthetic smile. The Carestream intraoral scanner helps Dr. HagShenas discover the areas of the jaw with the most bone to support the dental implants, in order to provide the most accurate and longest lasting results.Those in need of restorative dentistry in San Jose, CA who are looking to return to an ideal smile are encouraged to connect with Dr. HagShenas.
