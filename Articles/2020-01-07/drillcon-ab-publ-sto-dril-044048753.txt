Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Drillcon. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Drillcon! OM:DRIL Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Drillcon paid out 60% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A payout ratio above 50% generally implies a business is reaching maturity, although it is still possible to reinvest in the business or increase the dividend over time.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Drillcon paid out 101% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. While Drillcon's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, free cash flow is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to Drillcon's ability to maintain its dividend.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Drillcon's latest financial position,

Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Drillcon has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was kr0.03 in 2010, compared to kr0.35 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 28% a year over that time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 28% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.So, its dividends have grown at a rapid rate over this time, but payments have been cut in the past. The stock may still be worth considering as part of a diversified dividend portfolio.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. It's good to see Drillcon has been growing its earnings per share at 27% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share are sharply up, but we wonder if paying out more than half its earnings (leaving less for reinvestment) is an implicit signal that Drillcon's growth will be slower in the future.Story continuesConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, we think Drillcon has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Ultimately, Drillcon comes up short on our dividend analysis. It's not that we think it is a bad company - just that there are likely more appealing dividend prospects out there on this analysis.See if management have their own wealth at stake, by checking insider shareholdings in Drillcon stock.If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of dividend stocks yielding above 3%.If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
