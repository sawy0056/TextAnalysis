If you purchase the stock on or after the 9th of January, you won't be eligible to receive this dividend, when it is paid on the 12th of February.Bowl America's next dividend payment will be US$0.17 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.70 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Bowl America has a trailing yield of 4.5% on the current share price of $15.5318. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Bowl America Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Bowl America distributed an unsustainably high 125% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without extenuating circumstances, we'd consider the dividend at risk of a cut. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Bowl America generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the past year it paid out 133% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is uncomfortably high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Bowl America's payments were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we are concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.Click here to see how much of its profit Bowl America paid out over the last 12 months.AMEX:BWL.A Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MoreHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, Bowl America's earnings per share have been growing at 16% a year for the past five years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly, but we're disturbed to see the company paid out 125% of its earnings last year. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, we feel this is a clear concern around the sustainability of the dividend.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Bowl America has delivered 1.6% dividend growth per year on average over the past ten years. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.The Bottom LineIs Bowl America an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have been growing, despite the company paying out a concerningly high percentage of its earnings and cashflow. We struggle to see how a company paying out so much of its earnings and cash flow will be able to sustain its dividend in a downturn, or reinvest enough into its business to continue growing earnings without borrowing heavily. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.Story continuesWant to learn more about Bowl America?
