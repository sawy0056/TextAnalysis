Per a McKinsey research, autonomous vehicles are expected to contribute to 66% of passenger-kilometers traveled in 2040, while generating $1.1 trillion in mobility services revenues and $0.9 trillion in sales.Increasing popularity of mobility as a service (MaaS) solutions and accelerated deployment of 5G are anticipated to be tailwinds.
