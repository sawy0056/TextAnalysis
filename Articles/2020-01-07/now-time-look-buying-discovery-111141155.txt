(NASDAQ:DISC.A)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosLet's talk about the popular Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:DISC.A). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Discovery’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Discovery What's the opportunity in Discovery?Great news for investors – Discovery is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $58.74, but it is currently trading at US$32.03 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Discovery’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Discovery look like?NasdaqGS:DISC.A Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
