His playing is demanding, intricate, and deeply influenced by the likes of Sergei Rachmaninoff, Gustav Mahler, and Franz Liszt. His sound can be described as atmospheric and highly textured — an attempt to create new tonal tapestries that interweave a soaring, ornate, romantic sensibility with a modern, cinematic haze."My intent is to combine the emotive nature and technical intricacies of Late Romantic classical music with tactile, atmospheric styling that is both painterly and organic in feel," says Seif. "Though many of my influences are modern, I am not a minimalist in my approach. I compose from my heart, at the very edge of my technical ability, and with a sense of great urgency."With Works for Solo Piano, Vol. 1, Seif returns to his first love, the piano. Raised in multiple countries and now firmly rooted in California, Seif was a classically trained pianist prior to shifting into the visual arts to become an accomplished professional cinematographer and celebrity photographer (josephseif.com). He plans to perform the sonatas in multiple cities in 2020, while simultaneously promoting his recently published fine art photography book, ONWARD.ABOUT JOSEPH SEIFJoseph Seif is a composer and pianist, as well as a professional cinematographer and photographer. As a visual artist, he has lensed campaigns for Levi's, Mercedes-Benz, Visa, Airbnb, and many others, and his images have appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, and Forbes — having photographed the likes of Sir Richard Branson, Sean Penn, Sting, Metallica, and many other high-profile subjects.In the summer of 2019, while experiencing a creative burnout, Seif drove up the California coast intending to do some landscape photography, when he began to hear the first sonata in his head. He describes it as such: "The landscape seemed to howl and twist, and memories of childhood, distant lands, and people lost all hummed in unison. The cameras never came out of their bag. I came home and started writing the score. I worked late into the night, for weeks. When it was finished, I immediately booked a studio and an engineer, and recorded it in a matter of days." His second sonata quickly followed, and was completed in December 2019. He lives and works in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where he is currently composing his third sonata.Contact:  Joseph Seif 231801@email4pr.com www.josephseifmusic.com (310) 736-1499 Press Kit View photosCisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/composer-and-pianist-joseph-seif-releases-new-classical-piano-works-300981154.htmlSOURCE Joseph SeifReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
