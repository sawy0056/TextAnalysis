But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like goeasy (TSE:GSY), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. See our latest analysis for goeasy How Quickly Is goeasy Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price will eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, goeasy has grown EPS by 31% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be smiling.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. I note that goeasy's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort my analysis of its margins. While we note goeasy's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 15% to CA$379m. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are goeasy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I like company leaders to have some skin in the game, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own goeasy shares worth a considerable sum. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at CA$271m. Coming in at 27% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. So it might be my imagination, but I do sense the glimmer of an opportunity.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like goeasy with market caps between CA$519m and CA$2.1b is about CA$2.0m.goeasy offered total compensation worth CA$1.6m to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Story continuesIs goeasy Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that goeasy has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. Each to their own, but I think all this makes goeasy look rather interesting indeed. Of course, just because goeasy is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Although goeasy certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
