[1] "Insurance carriers are aware of the need to upgrade their technology," says John Clifford, COO, Ensurem LLC, "but they are also aware that in an industry full of highly complex legacy systems, this is not an overnight process. Meanwhile, consumer expectations in terms of service continue to escalate."To help both consumers and insurance carriers achieve their objectives, says Clifford, what is needed is a user-friendly online platform serving as an insurance broker on one side and a provider of tailored product information and purchasing opportunities on the other. Ensurem which has carrier relationships with Aetna, Humana, Ameritas, and other major health insurers, has designed such a platform.Ensurem, which was founded in 2016, operates in two divisions: one focused on improving the consumer-facing digital insurance shopping experience and the other focused on providing technology solutions for insurance carriers. Both divisions are backed by a fully licensed Contact Center. Together they form an integrated platform that insurance companies can use to market their direct products more efficiently and effectively to a growing and massive senior market, thereby swiftly and effectively aiding the agent-based business model. Ensurem builds company- and product-specific marketing programs designed to drive qualified traffic to the platform. The use of lead generation within social media platforms and search engines, online consumer tools such as quoting engines and educational microsites, and first-in-industry in-store retail kiosks allows the insurer to reach their specific demographic consumers, Baby Boomers.The need for a streamlined consumer interface is especially acute in a time-sensitive and rapidly changing market such as that for Medicare solutions. Late enrollees for example—seniors who for one reason or another have failed to sign up for Medicare during the seven-month period surrounding their 65th birthday—will be required to act during the next General Enrollment Period, which will run from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020. [2] Meanwhile, there are now 22 million people enrolled in managed-care Medicare Advantage plans [3], which continue to change in ways that encourage both increasing enrollment and greater complexity. And while the Medicare Annual Enrollment Period ended December 7, current Medicare Advantage beneficiaries get one last chance to make changes to their 2020 coverage during the Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period (January 1 – March 31.)"The Medicare solutions market today," Clifford says, "is in some ways a microcosm of the overall insurance industry. It is notable for a costly and inconsistent agent sales model, complicated and somewhat old-fashioned products, and a slow, expensive selling-and-buying process. The Ensurem solution is to provide an online consumer marketplace designed to educate visitors and rapidly match customer to product, simplify application, automate underwriting, and instantly provide finished documents. Our goal, in other words, is to help insurers meet the needs of a 21st-century consumer base."About Ensurem Ensurem, headquartered in Clearwater, FL, is a leading technology and product distribution company serving carriers and consumers within the massive U.S. senior market. The company provides end-to-end solutions for carriers, including product development, digital marketing, and consumer-centric front ends and back end.
