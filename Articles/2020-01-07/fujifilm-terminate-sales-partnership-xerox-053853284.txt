Xerox, on the other hand, will be able to enter growing Asian office equipment markets from April 2021.Meanwhile, Fuji Xerox has already announced it would change its corporate name to Fujifilm Business Innovation, effective April 2021.The relationship between Fujifilm and Xerox soured recently as merger talks between the two companies broke down, and they started playing the blame game in May 2019.Fujifilm scraped a deal with Xerox in November under which it would buy a 25% stake in Fuji Xerox after investor activism ruined a deal involving the two companies.Photo Credit: Courtesy of Fujifilm Corporation0See more from BenzingaSony To Develop New Vision Sensor For Self-Driving VehiclesChip Market Could Rebound In 2020: Nintendo And Apple Chip MakerSamsung Shipped 6.7M Smartphones With 5G In 2019, Exceeding Its Own Expectations© 2020 Benzinga.com.
