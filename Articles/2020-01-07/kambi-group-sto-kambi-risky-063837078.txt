It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Kambi Group plc (STO:KAMBI) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Kambi Group What Is Kambi Group's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2019 Kambi Group had debt of €7.29m, up from €7.5 in one year. But on the other hand it also has €41.5m in cash, leading to a €34.2m net cash position.OM:KAMBI Historical Debt, January 6th 2020MoreA Look At Kambi Group's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Kambi Group had liabilities of €15.9m due within a year, and liabilities of €13.2m falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of €41.5m and €19.7m worth of receivables due within a year. So it can boast €32.1m more liquid assets than total liabilities.This short term liquidity is a sign that Kambi Group could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Simply put, the fact that Kambi Group has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.But the other side of the story is that Kambi Group saw its EBIT decline by 3.5% over the last year. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Kambi Group can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Kambi Group has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Looking at the most recent three years, Kambi Group recorded free cash flow of 44% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.Summing upWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Kambi Group has net cash of €34.2m, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities.
