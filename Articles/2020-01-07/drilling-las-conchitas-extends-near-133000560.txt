The Las Conchitas area is located approximately 2.5 kilometers south of the fully permitted San Albino gold project currently under construction.The goal of the 2019 drill program at Las Conchitas was to confirm near surface, shallow dipping, high-grade gold mineralization previously encountered in trenches and drill holes across eight separate gold bearing zones and to prioritize targets to begin delineating a maiden resource at Las Conchitas. The Company completed 81 shallow drill holes totaling 5,994.60 meters ("m") within the Las Conchitas area in 2019 (see the attached map). Akiba Leisman , Chief Executive Officer of Mako states "our 2019 Las Conchitas drilling was designed to prioritize drilling targets to the south of our San Albino gold project currently under construction. The surface area with known gold mineralization at Las Conchitas is already larger than that of San Albino, and we have had numerous near surface intercepts of over one ounce gold at the Mango Zone, which has become our most advanced target. In 2020, drilling at Las Conchitas will be focused on delineating a maiden resource at the Mango Zone."This press release contains results from 21 holes totaling 1,794.90 m drilled into five zones. Results from the 2019 drill program at Las Conchitas were previously reported in press releases dated May 6, 2019 , May 21, 2019 , August 19, 2019 and September 10, 2019 . There are 19 additional drill holes still awaiting assay results from the laboratory as the Company has prioritized receiving assays from the recently completed 15,312.52-meter San Albino infill drill program to the north.The highest grade interval reported in this press release was in drill hole LC19-135, which intersected 56.80 g/t Au and 70.3 g/t Ag over 1.4 m (see the attached cross and long sections).  LC19-135 successfully tested the southwest extension of the Mango Zone for an additional 30 m from hole LC11-01 which intersected 62.96 g/t Au and 61.7 g/t Ag over 3.0 meters (see press release dated February 22, 2012 ) and confirmed a 140 m down dip extension from the surface exposure observed in trench LC11-TR01 (see press release dated February 25 , 2013).  LC19-135 is approximately 52 meters to the north of LC19-70 which intersected 376.49 g/t Au and 103 g/t Ag over 1.0 meters (see press release dated May 6, 2019 ).Additionally, drill hole LC19-141, which was collared 130 m along strike from drill hole LC11-01 (see press release dated February 22, 2012 ), intersected three strongly mineralized intervals as follows:Upper Mango Zone - 4.11 g/t Au and 4.1 g/t Ag over 0.5 m from 27.5 m to 28 m downhole Mango Zone - 3.22 g/t Au and 4.5 g/t Ag over 0.5 m from 61 m to 61.5 m downhole Mango Zone - 44.6 g/t Au and 43.1 g/t Ag over 0.7 m from 68.2 m to 68.9 m downholeDrilling at the Mango Zone has confirmed high-grade, near surface gold mineralization and remains open both at depth and along strike.Furthermore, drill hole LC19-124 was designed to test the southwest extension of the Intermediate Zone, which intersected 7.20 g/t Au and 14.2 g/t Ag over 21.3 meters, including 28.45 g/t Au and 53.7 g/t Ag over 5.0 meters (see press release dated September 11, 2013 ) and to test the down dip extension of the Mango Zone further downhole.  LC19-124 intersected two voids where the southwest extension of the Intermediate Zone was projected and intersected two intervals representing the Mango Zone of 8.68 g/t Au and 24.9 g/t Ag over 0.8 m and 26.8 g/t Au and 50.1 g/t Ag over 0.7 m , respectively.  The second interval contains visible gold and intersected mineralization at a vertical depth of 155 meters.Las Conchitas Assay Results Reported In This Press Release

The mineralized intervals shown above utilize a 1.0 g/t gold cut-off grade with not more than 1.0 meter of internal dilution. *Lengths are reported as core lengths. True widths vary depending on drill hole dip, the veins are shallow dipping and typical true widths are 80-100% of the downhole width. **Indicates assays determined using the metallic screening method

All reported drill results in this press release used the metallic screening method.  The Company follows industry standards in its QA&QC procedures. Control samples consisting of duplicates, standards, and blanks were inserted into the sample stream at a ratio of 1 control sample per every 10 samples.  Analytical results of control samples confirmed reliability of the assay data.  No top cut has been applied to the reported assay results.Qualified PersonJohn M.
