Additionally, Parallax holds exclusive worldwide licenses with Montecito Bio Sciences, Ltd., (“Montecito”).  The Montecito portfolio of patents include: 1) a “Method to Produce a Plurality of Antibodies”, United States patent number US9,573,990 covering its breakthrough; 2) a “Portable Apparatus for Sample Analysis”, United States patent number US8,920,725 with; 3) its international counterparts in China CN200780039901.x; and 4) Hong Kong HK 10103654.9; and 5) India IN279743; and 6) Macau MOJ00129; and 7)  a “Flow Through Testing System with Pressure Indicator”, United States patent number US9,588,114 to name a few of the Company’s patents or licenses now owned within the IP portfolio of assets.   Parallax has studied and already acquired unbiased third-party confirmation of the infringing landscape and is in the process of compiling a detailed third-party validity report from a highly respected IP valuation group as to the infringement claims and damages within the Human Diagnostics and Behavioral Healthcare markets.  Top tier international law firms have interviewed with the Company clearing for all legal conflicts and have begun to propose to Parallax’s management various strategies best to monetize value for our shareholders through a variety of possible licensing strategies, which could include litigation.  The Company is focused on possible non-dilutive litigation financing and various hybrid contingency proposals for a robust patent enforcement initiative that will begin to address Parallax’s damages stemming from infringement of our operations Nathaniel Bradley, Parallax Health Sciences, Inc., Chief Technology Officer, stated, “IP monetization is a long process although we were early in our innovations, as a result we have the patents to prove it. Parallax is now well informed and positioned to properly monetize the substantial worth of our IP in today’s marketplace and to continue to protect our patented position in the growing landscape as the telehealth and diagnostics markets further mature.”  Mr. Bradley continued, “We are continuing to reduce to practice what our IP claims state and are furthering the build out of our leading diagnostic and cognitive behavioral platform for remote patient monitoring. Parallax owns foundational patents and those rights are ours to defend for our shareholders. We are continuing to innovate and protect our patented position in the marketplace.”   Paul Arena, Parallax Health Sciences, Inc., Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We continue to believe there are a number of companies operating in the marketplace whose activities and products infringe on our patents.”  Further Mr. Arena stated, “We are now positioned with strategic offensive as well as defensive claims in our IP portfolio and while we believe we have complete freedom to operate our platform technologies, others in our space do not.  Therefore, we will approach a number of these infringing companies with the offer to either license our technology or they should be prepared to defend against our claims.”About Parallax Health Sciences Story continuesParallax Health Sciences is an advanced technology, outcome-driven telehealth company that allows for cost-effective remote diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients through proprietary platforms of integrated products and services.
