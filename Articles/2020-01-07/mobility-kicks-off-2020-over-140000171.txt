These factors have combined to account for a shared mobility market projected to grow to $1.5-2 trillion by 2030. Sustainable mobility solutions are increasingly critical worldwide as cities are expected to hold 60% of the world's population by 2030 and total driven miles are predicted to reach an all-time high in 2040.With popular ridesharing services only exacerbating congestion issues, HERE Mobility's open and competitive smart mobility marketplace tackles transportation concerns for businesses in every sector by enabling them to connect their customers to the widest array of regional mobility options available on a single multi-modal platform. The Mobility Marketplace allows businesses to enrich their core offering, creating a full, end-to-end customer experience.With more than 2.5 million signed vehicles, the HERE Mobility Marketplace is now available in more than 100 major cities around the world. In 2019, the Marketplace saw 200% growth among North American demand partners and 100% growth among demand partners in Europe."To compete in today's oversaturated ecosystem, businesses are looking for a door-to-door customer experience – including first and last-mile transportation," said Liad Itzhak, SVP, Head of HERE Mobility. "In connecting new sectors to our mobility solutions, we are not only helping create sustainable mobility, but enabling businesses to provide a complete experience for their customers.""While the ride-hailing giants have captured a percentage of the hyper-fragmented market by undercutting other mobility suppliers, we are disrupting the disruptors," Itzhak continued. "Our technology empowers the majority of the market and enables these suppliers to be competitive by ensuring that they are as efficient as possible. This enables suppliers to provide high-quality service, decrease their prices, and make every kilometer count with optimized routing; it's a win for suppliers, consumers and the environment."Companies from a wide variety of sectors partnered with HERE Mobility in 2019 to meet their mobility needs. Hospitality industry partners include Marriott International's Westin San Diego, W Hollywood, and Four Points by Sheraton in San Diego. Finance and banking sector partners include digital fintech leader Wirecard, and Bancolombia.
