More than 90% of the mineral processed in 2019 produced two concentrates.During 2019, the Plant produced high grade quality concentrates for third parties in twenty-two mineral campaigns, or batches, ranging from 232 metric tonnes to 1,750 metric tonnes. All but two of the batches were polymetallic. The Plant achieved excellent recoveries by producing 4,091 metric tonnes of highly marketable Zinc concentrates averaging 52.4% Zn and 1,364 tonnes of Lead-Silver concentrates averaging 52.9% Pb and 125 ounces Ag per tonne. Forty-six tonnes of Copper concentrate was also produced by processing only one small batch of copper mineral.

The Plant is producing quality concentrates and the Company has established good relationships in Northern Peru, while continuously reviewing new opportunities. During 2020 the Company intends to continue processing mineralized material with a few select miners while also entering mineral purchase and profit-sharing agreements with other miners. The Company will continue to focus on improving profit margins and plans to divest of certain non-core assets during 2020."The Aguila Norte processing plant has an environmental permit ("IGAC") from the Peruvian government which provides the Plant with the ability to expand operations past the current 100 tonnes per day level.Jeffrey Reeder, P Geo, a qualified person as defined in National Instrument 43-101, has prepared, supervised the preparation or approved the scientific and technical disclosure contained in this news release.About Peruvian Metals Corp.Peruvian Metals Corp. is a Canadian Exploration and Mineral Processing company.
