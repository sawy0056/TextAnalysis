But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Gilat Satellite Networks (NASDAQ:GILT). Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. View our latest analysis for Gilat Satellite Networks How Fast Is Gilat Satellite Networks Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Gilat Satellite Networks has grown earnings per share (EPS) like young bamboo after rain; fast, and from a low base. So I don't think the percent growth rate is particularly meaningful. As a result, I'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Over twelve months, Gilat Satellite Networks increased its EPS from US$0.30 to US$0.32. That's a modest gain of 6.9%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Unfortunately, Gilat Satellite Networks's revenue dropped 8.7% last year, but the silver lining is that EBIT margins improved from 7.0% to 9.4%. That's not ideal.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So check Gilat Satellite Networks's balance sheet strength, before getting too excited.Are Gilat Satellite Networks Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I always like to check up on CEO compensation, because I think that reasonable pay levels, around or below the median, can be a sign that shareholder interests are well considered. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Gilat Satellite Networks with market caps between US$200m and US$800m is about US$1.7m.Gilat Satellite Networks offered total compensation worth US$920k to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given its below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Gilat Satellite Networks Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As I already mentioned, Gilat Satellite Networks is a growing business, which is what I like to see. Not only that, but the CEO is paid quite reasonably, which makes me feel more trusting of the board of directors. So all in all I think it's worth at least considering for your watchlist. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Gilat Satellite Networks is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Story continuesAlthough Gilat Satellite Networks certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
