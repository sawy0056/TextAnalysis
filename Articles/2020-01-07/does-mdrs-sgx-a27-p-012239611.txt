Zooming out, the recent drop wiped out a year's worth of gains, with the share price now back where it was a year ago.All else being equal, a share price drop should make a stock more attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So, on certain occasions, long term focussed investors try to take advantage of pessimistic expectations to buy shares at a better price. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. View our latest analysis for mDR Does mDR Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?mDR's P/E of 9.71 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. If you look at the image below, you can see mDR has a lower P/E than the average (12.2) in the electronic industry classification.SGX:A27 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoremDR's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.mDR's earnings per share fell by 38% in the last twelve months. And EPS is down 21% a year, over the last 3 years. This could justify a low P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Is Debt Impacting mDR's P/E?mDR's net debt equates to 35% of its market capitalization. While that's enough to warrant consideration, it doesn't really concern us.The Verdict On mDR's P/E RatiomDR's P/E is 9.7 which is below average (13.5) in the SG market. The debt levels are not a major concern, but the lack of EPS growth is likely weighing on sentiment. Given mDR's P/E ratio has declined from 19.4 to 9.7 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is more worried about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for deep value investors this stock might justify some research.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
