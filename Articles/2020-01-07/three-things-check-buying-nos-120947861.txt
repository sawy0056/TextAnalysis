(ELI:NOS) For Its DividendSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosDividend paying stocks like NOS, S.G.P.S., S.A. (ELI:NOS) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.In this case, NOS S.G.P.S likely looks attractive to investors, given its 7.2% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on NOS S.G.P.S! ENXTLS:NOS Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. NOS S.G.P.S paid out 116% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. NOS S.G.P.S paid out 103% of its free cash flow last year, which we think is concerning if cash flows do not improve. As NOS S.G.P.S's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.Is NOS S.G.P.S's Balance Sheet Risky?As NOS S.G.P.S's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. NOS S.G.P.S has net debt of 1.78 times its EBITDA, which we think is not too troublesome.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. NOS S.G.P.S has interest cover of more than 12 times its interest expense, which we think is quite strong.We update our data on NOS S.G.P.S every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. NOS S.G.P.S has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €0.16 in 2010, compared to €0.35 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.1% a year over that time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 8.1% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.Story continuesA reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see NOS S.G.P.S has grown its earnings per share at 60% per annum over the past five years. The company has been growing its EPS at a very rapid rate, while paying out virtually all of its income as dividends. Generally, a company that is growing rapidly while paying out a majority of its earnings, is seeing its debt burden increase. We'd be conscious of any extra risk added by this practice.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. NOS S.G.P.S paid out almost all of its cash flow and profit as dividends, leaving little to reinvest in the business. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. In summary, NOS S.G.P.S has a number of shortcomings that we'd find it hard to get past. Things could change, but we think there are likely more attractive alternatives out there.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
