But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. For example, the Kadmon Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:KDMN) share price is up 90% in the last year, clearly besting the market return of around 27% (not including dividends). So that should have shareholders smiling. On the other hand, longer term shareholders have had a tougher run, with the stock falling 8.0% in three years. See our latest analysis for Kadmon Holdings Kadmon Holdings recorded just US$396,000 in revenue over the last twelve months, which isn't really enough for us to consider it to have a proven product. So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. It seems likely some shareholders believe that Kadmon Holdings has the funding to invent a new product before too long.As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. There is usually a significant chance that they will need more money for business development, putting them at the mercy of capital markets. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some companies like this go on to deliver on their plan, making good money for shareholders, many end in painful losses and eventual de-listing. Some Kadmon Holdings investors have already had a taste of the sweet taste stocks like this can leave in the mouth, as they gain popularity and attract speculative capital.When it reported in September 2019 Kadmon Holdings had minimal cash in excess of all liabilities consider its expenditure: just US$47m to be specific. So if it hasn't remedied the situation already, it will almost certainly have to raise more capital soon.
