(CSE:BLGV) in 2016. This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels. Check out our latest analysis for Belgravia Hartford Capital How Does Mehdi Azodi's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?Our data indicates that Belgravia Hartford Capital Inc. is worth CA$4.0m, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as CA$979k for the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at CA$318k.
