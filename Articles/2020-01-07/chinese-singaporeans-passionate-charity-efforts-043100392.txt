Through a fusion of music and charity, and with different aspects of art displaying the values of life, this New Year ceremony brought the disabled community into the spotlight. This concert was organised by the Beijing Foundation for Disabled Persons and Chinese-Singaporean youth Yifeng Hu, who was the initiator for this event. As a representative of students studying abroad, Yifeng Hu, through his breathtaking piano playing, calls to more students who study abroad to take notice of the disabled, and to help charity in China. 2020 marks the 30th anniversary of Sino-Singaporean relations, and the participation of youths from both countries saw a success in helping the disabled through music.Chinese-Singaporean youth Yifeng Hu was playing piano at “sing out the passion of life - 2020 Beijing Foundation for Disabled Persons Concert” on January 3rd, 2020.MoreChinese-Singaporean youth, Yifeng Hu, was born in Shanghai, and currently resides in Singapore with his parents. He started studying piano at age 6 and went to England to study at age 9. Although only 17, he is already very experienced in helping those with special needs. He visits a school for special needs to help the children each week. Some of the kids have problems with hearing, some have autism, and although he found it difficult to communicate with them at first, Yifeng slowly became better at helping the children, and they too in turn warmed to him. He notes that they are just as excited and expectant of the future as anyone else, and at certain skills they even out-perform their peers. Yifeng says: "when engaging with these children with special needs, we should not look at them with any bias or predetermined opinion. We should welcome them, support them, give them confidence. We should nurture and help give them more opportunities to fulfil their potential."Music is an incredibly powerful medium, and adds colour to lives of people. As 2020 arrives, Yifeng Hu hopes to use his musical talent, and through the medium of music to raise more attention from youths to the disabled community, to help these people have more opportunities and a brighter future.During the concert, there were many guests who featured, including famous blind dizi player Tan Weihai, visually impaired erhu player Zhang Zhixuan, armless pianist Liu Wei, and they all helped to create a special and moving occasion. Through the whole concert it would be impossible to imagine that the people producing the wonderful music had any disabilities. Music has no boundaries, and cannot be stopped by disabilities; music has a place in every person's heart.For many years, the Beijing Foundation for Disabled Persons have made significant contributions to charity in Beijing, through research and experimenting with many different approaches, and continue to devote their full effort to the cause. The start of the new year, through music singing out the passion of life, reminds everyone of the power of life. Life is not perfect and often has defects, but these disabled people have shown society that they do not lack artistic talent and willpower. They have and are always working hard. They also hope there will be more talented youths like Yifeng Hu, who are willing the carry their generation's responsibility, that pay more attention to those with special needs, and offer their own power to help charity for their country.Photo - https://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20200106/2682838-1SOURCE Beijing Foundation for Disabled PersonsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, two others arrested on illegal assembly charges - mediaReutersDiary of a quarantined American in coronavirus-era ChinaMarketWatchChina Makes Bad Loans Disappear as Virus Pummels Banking SystemBloombergBeijing’s city government issued 10 anti-coronavirus rules for workplacesQuartzOfficials: Chinese industry recovering, more aid comingAssociated PressRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
