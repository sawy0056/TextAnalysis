But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the Auto Trader Group plc (LON:AUTO) share price is up 42% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 6.4% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 33% , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for Auto Trader Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Auto Trader Group was able to grow its EPS at 16% per year over three years, sending the share price higher.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Auto Trader Group, it has a TSR of 48% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Auto Trader Group shareholders have gained 33% (in total) over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain actually surpasses the 14% TSR it generated (per year) over three years.
