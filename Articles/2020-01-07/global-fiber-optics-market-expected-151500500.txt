A detailed analysis of key industry players has been conducted to provide insights into their business overviews, products & services, and key strategies associated with the market for fibre optics.The key players profiled in the report include Corning Incorporated (US), Prysmian Group (Italy), Finisar (US), AFL Global (US), Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd (Japan), LS Cable & System (South Korea), Leoni AG (Germany), Furukawa Electric Co. Ltd. (Japan), General Cable Corporation (US), Sterlite Technologies Limited (India), and Optical Cable Corporation (US).Increasing demand for the internet is expected to drive the fibre optics market. The fibre optics market is mainly driven by the increasing demand for internet and growing need for Fiber To The x (FTTx). The internet is a global system of connected devices. Fibre optics acts as the backbone of the internet; optical fibre cable is used as the medium for transmitting information from one point to another. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 51.2% of the global population was using the internet in 2018. The growth rate of the number of the internet users was around 45% in the same year. The growing importance of cloud computing, data transfer and storage, and Internet of Things (IoT) is driving the use of the internet. Glass is projected to account for the largest share of the overall fibre optics market, in terms of value, between 2019 and 2024.Glass is the largest fibre type of fibre optics due to its increasing demand from various applications. The high performance and easy availability of glass fibre optics is driving the glass fibre optics market. North America and Europe are mature markets. On the other hand, the markets in APAC and the Middle East & Africa are growing because of the rapid industrial growth in these regions.Single-mode is the largest cable type in the overall fibre optics market in terms of value.The consumption of single-mode fibre optic is very high in the fibre optics market. The single-mode type optical cables are designed to transmit a single propagation mode per polarization direction for a given wavelength. Factors including changing demographic trends, increasing number of connected devices, and growth in penetration are expected to contribute to the growth of the single-mode cable type segment of the fibre optics market.Rapid industrialization in APAC to drive the demand for fibre optics.The APAC fibre optics market is projected to be the largest during the forecast period. The growing industrialization and infrastructural development in the region have offered enormous opportunities for the use of fibre optics across various applications in APAC. The major fibre optics markets in APAC are China, Japan, India, Australia, and South Korea. China is the major hub for manufacturing activities, globally, and is also one of the largest in terms of a number of internet users. Also, China is the most populous country in the world, which has resulted in the growth of applications, such as telecom, premises, utility, CATV, and industrial. Moreover, countries including India and South Korea are also witnessing significant growth rates on account of the growing industrial activities in the region.Story continuesKey Topics Covered1 Introduction 2 Research Methodology 3 Executive Summary 4 Premium Insights 4.1 Growth Opportunities for the Fiber Optics Manufacturers4.2 Fiber Optics Market, By Region4.3 Asia-Pacific Fiber Optics Market, By Country, and Application4.4 Fiber Optics Market, By Key Country4.5 Fiber Optics Market, By Application5 Market Overview 5.1 Introduction5.2 Market Dynamics5.2.1 Drivers5.2.1.1 Increasing Demand for the Internet5.2.1.2 Growing Need for FTTx5.2.2 Restraints5.2.2.1 Wireless Communication Systems5.2.3 Opportunities5.2.3.1 Growing Telecommunication Industry in Middle East & Africa5.2.3.2 Advances in Technology5.3 Regulatory Framework6 Industry Trends 6.1 Porter's Five Forces Analysis6.1.1 Bargaining Power of Buyers6.1.2 Bargaining Power of Suppliers6.1.3 Threat of New Entrants6.1.4 Threat of Substitutes6.1.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry6.4 Macroeconomic Indicators6.4.1 GDP Trends and Forecast6.4.2 Internet Users7 Fibre Optics Market, By Cable Type 7.1 Introduction7.2 Market Analysis, By Cable Type7.2.1 Single Mode7.2.2 Multi-Mode8 Fibre Optics Market, By Optical Fiber Type 8.1 Introduction8.2 Market Analysis, By Optical Fiber Type8.2.1 Glass8.2.2 Plastic9 Fibre Optics Market, By Application 9.1 Introduction9.2 Market Analysis, By Application9.2.1 Communications9.2.1.1 Telecom9.2.1.2 Premises9.2.1.3 Utility9.2.1.4 CATV9.2.1.5 Industrial9.2.1.6 Military9.2.1.7 Others9.2.2 Non-Communications9.2.2.1 Sensors9.2.2.2 Fiber Optic Lighting10 Fibre Optics Market, Regional Analysis 10.1 Introduction10.2 Asia-Pacific10.3 North America10.4 Europe10.5 Middle East & Africa10.6 South America11 Competitive Landscape 11.1 Introduction11.2 Competitive Leadership Mapping, Tier 1 Companies11.2.1 Visionary Leaders11.2.2 Innovators11.3 Strength of Product Portfolio11.4 Business Strategy Excellence11.5 Competitive Leadership Mapping (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises)11.5.1 Progressive Companies11.5.2 Responsive Companies11.5.3 Starting Blocks11.6 Strength of Product Portfolio11.7 Business Strategy Excellence11.8 Market Share Analysis11.9 Competitive Scenario12 Company Profiles 12.1 Corning Inc.12.2 Prysmian Group12.3 Finisar12.4 AFL Global12.5 Sumitomo Electric Industries (SEI)12.6 LS Cable & System12.7 Leoni AG12.8 Furukawa Electric12.9 Finolex12.10 Sterlite Technologies Limited12.11 Optical Cable Corporation12.12 Fujikura Limited12.13 Yangtze Optical Fiber & Cable Co.
