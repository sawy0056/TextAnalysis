On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Fufeng Group Limited (HKG:546).What Is Insider Selling?It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. View our latest analysis for Fufeng Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Fufeng GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Principal Founder & Chairman Xuechun Li for HK$11m worth of shares, at about HK$3.70 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than HK$3.66 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Xuechun Li was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.Xuechun Li purchased 3.58m shares over the year. The average price per share was HK$3.70.
