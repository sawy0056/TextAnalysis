All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does American States Water's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (37.9) for companies in the water utilities industry is roughly the same as American States Water's P/E.NYSE:AWR Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that American States Water shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.American States Water increased earnings per share by a whopping 29% last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 7.7%. So we'd generally expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does American States Water's Balance Sheet Tell Us?American States Water's net debt is 15% of its market cap. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.The Bottom Line On American States Water's P/E RatioAmerican States Water's P/E is 39.3 which is above average (18.9) in its market. While the company does use modest debt, its recent earnings growth is very good. Therefore, it's not particularly surprising that it has a above average P/E ratio.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
