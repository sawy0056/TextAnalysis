To keep it practical, we'll show how Sampo Oyj's (HEL:SAMPO) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Sampo Oyj has a price to earnings ratio of 19.31, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 5.2%. Check out our latest analysis for Sampo Oyj How Do I Calculate Sampo Oyj's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Sampo Oyj:P/E of 19.31 = €39.40 ÷ €2.04 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each €1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.How Does Sampo Oyj's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (12.5) for companies in the insurance industry is lower than Sampo Oyj's P/E.HLSE:SAMPO Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Sampo Oyj shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Sampo Oyj shrunk earnings per share by 32% over the last year. And over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have decreased 5.9% annually. This might lead to muted expectations.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does Sampo Oyj's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Sampo Oyj has net cash of €7.3b. This is fairly high at 33% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Bottom Line On Sampo Oyj's P/E RatioSampo Oyj's P/E is 19.3 which is about average (20.1) in the FI market. While the absence of growth in the last year is probably causing a degree of pessimism, the net cash position means it's not surprising that expectations put the company roughly in line with the market average P/E.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
