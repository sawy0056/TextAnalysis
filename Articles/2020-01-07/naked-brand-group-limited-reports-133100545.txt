Management Commentary "The positive results from the implementation of our new strategic direction, as a lean, direct-to-consumer business model were demonstrated in our first half fiscal 2020 financial results," said Anna Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of Naked. "Significant reductions with our cost structure have resulted in a 37% reduction in our EBITDA loss versus the same year ago period."Since our last update we have completed a full global strategic review, supported by external professional services firm FTI Consulting Limited. This has resulted in a complete global restructure in particular to the Bendon and FOH Online operating subsidiaries to consolidate and right size the business, in line with future forecasted sales and costs. I am happy to report the following activity has been undertaken in the first stage of our business transformation as a result of this work:Closure of Sydney office, New York wholesale office and Los Angeles distribution center presence with return of all functions to the home office of Bendon in New Zealand;Review and renegotiation of all unfavorable contracts including restructuring of the merchandise, planning, sourcing, production and marketing functions to New Zealand;Completed FOH Online operational review with an investment in the implementation of new platforms and partners to reduce operating expenses by an additional USD$1.2 million over the next 12-18 months;Review of technology and partners in our E-commerce business andHead count reduction by 67 employees and a salary saving of an estimated USD$3.5 million."Due to our recent financing initiatives, which cleared a significant amount of supplier payables while providing us with additional cash to stock the channel - we are now on track to have sufficient inventory in place to supply our growing customer demand, enabling a resumption of revenue growth. Our balance sheet has also improved as we now have creditors currently sit at circa USD$4.8 million versus USD$17.0 million in October 2018 or a reduction of 72% in the last 14 months. Debtors have been reduced from USD$5.0 million with USD$0.9 million aged over 60 days to a new total of USD$2.7 million and aged over 60 days at just USD$0.015 million or a total reduction of 54%."Overall, the first stage of our transformation is complete and we are excited about what's to come and have some excellent plans in progress and on the horizon for our business. We plan to provide an operational update in the first quarter of 2020 to discuss new product initiatives, sourcing and supply chain initiatives and potential divestitures. As a much loved, iconic New Zealand company with a history dating back 72 years, we are excited to be bring Bendon home and to reset the company for the next 72 years," concluded Johnson.First Half Fiscal 2020 Financial ResultsNet sales in the first half of 2020 totaled NZD$42.1 million, or USD$ 27.6 million, compared to NZD$56.8 million, or USD$37.2 million, in the first half of 2019. Sales were down in all markets except US Wholesale and e-commerce, negatively impacting our group trading result overall for the period. Sales continued to be impacted by the lack of current season stock supply due to past significant cashflow restraints and timing to rebuild inventory levels.Gross profit totaled approximately NZD$14.0 million, or USD$9.2 million, in the first half of 2020 as compared to NZD$17.7 million, or USD$11.6 million, in the first half of 2019. Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 33.2% in the first half of 2020, as compared to approximately 31.2% in the first half of 2019. The increase in gross margin was caused by reduced discounts provided to customers and lower product costs.Operating expenses totaled NZD$41.9 million, or USD$27.7 million, in the first half of 2020, compared to NZD$44.2 million, or USD$29.0 million, in the first half of 2019. The decrease in operating expenses was largely attributable to the adoption of IFRS16 lease accounting treatment.Net loss totaled NZD$28.7 million, or USD$18.8 million, in the first half of 2020, or NZD$0.52, or USD$0.34, per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of NZD$26.1 million, or USD$17.1 million, in the first half of 2019, or NZD$1.28, or USD$0.84, per basic and diluted share. The net loss was mainly due to the impact of lower sales resulting largely from inventory cash funding constraints, as well as impairment costs and transaction expenses related mainly to the issue of shares to manufacturers, all partially offset by improved gross margin percentage, and lower costs in proportion to lower sales and additional cost savings.Story continuesEBITDA loss decreased to NZD$9.8 million, or USD$6.4 million, in the first half of 2020 from NZD$15.4 million, or USD$10.1 million, in the first half of 2018. See below under the heading "Use of Non-IFRS Financial Information" for a discussion of EBITDA and a reconciliation of such measure to the most comparable measure calculated under IFRS.Cash and cash equivalents at July 31, 2019 totaled NZD$1.5 million, or USD$1.0 million, as compared to $4.2 million, or USD$2.7 million, at July 31, 2018. Subsequent to the closing of the first half fiscal 2020, the company raised a total of USD$14.0 million in the form of issued capital and convertible notes.The New Zealand Dollar figures in this press release were converted to United States Dollar figures at an 0.66 exchange rate.Further details about the Company's results in the first half 2020 are available on Form 6-K, which is accessible in the investor relations section of the Company's website at www.nakedbrands.com and through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website here.About Naked Brand Group Limited:Naked Brand Group Limited (NAKD) is a leading intimate apparel and swimwear company with a diverse portfolio of brands.

Specifically, we make use of the non-IFRS measures "EBITDA".EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and depletion, amortization, brand transition, restructure and transaction expenses, impairment losses, change in fair value losses and gains, and certain other non-cash charges, as set forth in the table below. Our management uses EBITDA as a measure of our operating results and considers it to be a meaningful supplement to loss before income taxes as a performance measurement, primarily because we incur significant depreciation and depletion, impairment losses and other non-cash expenses and charges, as well as significant non-operating expenses, and EBITDA substantially eliminates their impact. The intent of EBITDA is to provide additional useful information to investors. However, the measure does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Accordingly, this measure should not be considered in isolation or used in substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently.A reconciliation of EBITDA to profit (loss) before income tax, the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, is as follows:
