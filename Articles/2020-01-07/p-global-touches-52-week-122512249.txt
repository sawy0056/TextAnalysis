While the company’s bottom line continued to gain from revenue growth and benefits of productivity initiatives, the top line performed well on the back of strength across all the segments namely S&P Global Ratings, S&P Global Market Intelligence, S&P Global Platts and S&P Dow Jones Indices.Upbeat 2019 EPS GuidanceS&P Global raised its 2019 guidance for adjusted earnings per share in the last two reported quarters.During third-quarter 2019, the company raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $9.30-$9.40 from $9.10-$9.25 projected earlier.Strategic Acquisitions Bode WellAcquisitions have been a key growth strategy for S&P Global, helping it continuously innovate, increase differentiated content and develop new products.So far in 2019, the company has made acquisitions of 451 Research, Canadian Enerdata, Live Rice Index and Orion technology center. 451 Research is likely to strengthen S&P Global Market Intelligence's emerging technology expertise and offerings. Canadian Enerdata enhances S&P Global's Platts division's energy analytical capabilities and strengthens its foothold in North American natural gas market. Live Rice Index is a great addition to S&P Global’s Platts global agriculture offering. Orion technology center provides the company’s employees with access to the latest technologies and global communications infrastructure.On Nov 21, 2019, S&P Global announced that it has inked a deal to acquire the ESG Ratings Business from RobecoSAM.
