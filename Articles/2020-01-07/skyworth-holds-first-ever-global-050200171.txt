SKYWORTH aims to become the brand that leads the consumer electronics market of the future, offering 8K TVs and flagship-level OLED TVs, among other differentiated products, that meet the demands of the growing middle class."View photosTony Wang, Chief Executive and President of SKYWORTH TVMoreSKYWORTH's first 8K TV, the Q91 series: Reality, RealizedAs the mainstream TV market begins to shift away from 4K LCD TVs to address consumer desires for ultra-high-definition picture quality, the demand for higher quality TVs is growing stronger. Therefore, at CES SKYWORTH launched the latest in its Q series of TVs, the Q91. Q stands for "quality", and that is exactly what the Q91 provides for users who value the highest-end products and viewing experience. As SKYWORTH's first 8K TV available in the U.S. and other markets, the Q91 allows viewers to see realistic image quality combined with intelligent performance.With four times higher resolution than 4K, the 8K Q91 series offers image quality that rivals reality, supported by 120fps 8K for a smoother picture. The SoC supports 8K hardware decoding for up to 60fps, making 8K picture quality naturally smooth. The Q91 series adopts an 8K IPS LED hard screen, which arranges the liquid crystal molecules horizontally, offering wider viewing angles, faster response and more. It maintains a consistent and clear image from any angle, so the picture maintains color and optimal brightness.Story continuesThe 8K AI Image Processing Engine uses advanced image recognition and processing technology to improve the contrast, color and clarity of the picture, while intelligently modifying lower-resolution video content to closer to 8K resolution. The bezel-less 75-inch screen enables viewers to enjoy unrestricted viewing with a wide viewing angle of 178 degrees. In addition, the Q91 features Dolby Vision imaging technology, offering ultra-vivid picture quality – incredible brightness, contrast, color and detail that bring entertainment to life before your eyes. The Q91 series also provides an immersive audio experience with Dolby Atmos 2.1.2, as well as a HiFi passive filter and SKYWORTH's Wonder Audio Sky Echo built into the SoundBar, which moves soundwaves upwards to echo precisely into the user's ears.The 75-inch Q91 will be priced at US $5,999.SKYWORTH's wallpaper-thin OLED TV, the W81 and W81 Pro: See the Wonder As the first Chinese manufacturer of OLED basic modules (OBM), SKYWORTH launched its first self-manufactured OBM OLED TV series, the W81 and W81 Pro. As part of the "wonder" series, the cutting-edge W81 models offer an amazing viewing experience and sleek design.Inspired by the thin and light qualities of paper, the design of the W81 series is elegant and modern. The signature one-line design of the lower frame offers a minimalistic yet practical feel, with the microphone array and AI camera embedded on a thin illuminated line, while the combination of glass and metallic materials convey a sense of cleanliness and strength. At only 4.6mm thick at its slimmest point, the OLED screen seamlessly attaches to the wall. A 21-inch secondary display on the W81 Pro, equipped with the Swaiot OS, shows always-on information such as time and weather, as well as real-time updates including IoT device responses. With Dolby Vision, an ultra-wide viewing angle, expert image calibration, blue-light filtering for eye health and SOBiF non-afterimage technology, together with Dolby Atmos immersive audio, the W81 series offers a world-class entertainment experience in the comfort of your home.The W81 series can also be paired with the Swaiot PANEL, a new 4-inch or 10.1-inch supplementary display powered by SKYWORTH's Swaiot OS that automatically syncs with the program being played on the main TV. It will be available for purchase separately and will be compatible with other SKYWORTH TVs in the near future.The 65" W81 and 65" W81 Pro will retail for US $3,599 and US $4,599 respectively. Pricing and availability for the 77" W81 Pro will be announced at a later date.20 years of overseas expansion: SKYWORTH's global strategyThe launch of the Q91 and W81 series products at CES 2020 marks an important milestone in SKYWORTH's international business strategy.
