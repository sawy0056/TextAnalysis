But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. For example, the Select Harvests Limited (ASX:SHV) share price is up 39% in the last year, clearly besting the market return of around 19% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! However, the stock hasn't done so well in the longer term, with the stock only up 25% in three years. Check out our latest analysis for Select Harvests To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the last year Select Harvests grew its earnings per share, moving from a loss to a profit.When a company is just on the edge of profitability it can be well worth considering other metrics in order to more precisely gauge growth (and therefore understand share price movements).For starters, we suspect the share price has been buoyed by the dividend, which was increased during the year. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield, pushing the price up in the process. Though we must add that the revenue growth of 10% year on year would have helped paint a pretty picture.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:SHV Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreWe know that Select Harvests has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store?

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Select Harvests, it has a TSR of 44% for the last year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Select Harvests has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 44% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 10%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
