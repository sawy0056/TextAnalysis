(NYSE:  CXW) (the “Company") announced today that it has completed the acquisition of a portfolio of 28 properties, 24 of which the counter-party contributed to a newly formed partnership of the Company's, for total consideration of $83.2 million, excluding transaction-related expenses.  All of the properties are leased to the federal government through the General Services Administration (GSA).  The 445,000 square foot portfolio serves numerous federal agencies, including primarily the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of Hearings Operations. The 28-property portfolio is strategically located throughout the Mid-South, complementing CoreCivic's existing real estate footprint, and each property was built-to-suit for its federal tenant.  The buildings have been continuously owned and professionally managed by the original developer since construction.  The portfolio-average property age is 15 years and the portfolio's weighted average remaining lease term is 5.6 years.CoreCivic financed the acquisition with $7.7 million of cash, assumed debt of $52.2 million and the issuance of 1.3 million limited partnership units that are convertible after two years into cash or shares of our common stock.  The assumed debt carries a fixed interest rate of 4.9%, with fixed monthly payments extending through November 2025, and a balloon payment of $46.2 million due at maturity.  The acquisition is expected to contribute $0.01 to $0.02 of Funds From Operations per share on an annualized basis."We are excited to announce the acquisition of this 28-property portfolio, which highlights our ability to source transactions and execute our acquisition strategy to further expand our portfolio of government-lease real estate assets," said Damon Hininger, CoreCivic's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Utilizing a 'DownREIT' partnership structure provides us with another form of capital outside our traditional debt and equity securities, which provided us with the flexibility to complete an accretive transaction at an above average cap rate despite an equity price that we believe currently undervalues the Company's real estate assets and cash flows, while limiting the cash required to complete the acquisition."Including the acquisition announced today, the Company owns 56 properties representing nearly 2.9 million square feet of real estate within its CoreCivic Properties portfolio, all used by government agencies.  This portfolio complements the Company's portfolio of 50 correctional and detention facilities within its CoreCivic Safety segment and 29 residential reentry centers within its CoreCivic Community segment, with an aggregate design capacity of approximately 78,000 beds and 15.2 million square feet of real estate.  We believe the transaction further solidifies our place as the largest private owner of real estate used by U.S. government agencies and elevates our ranking to a top-15 owner of GSA-leased assets.CoreCivic completed this off-market transaction following introduction to the portfolio's ownership group by Colliers International's Rossi-Campton team.  About CoreCivicThe Company is a diversified government solutions company with the scale and experience needed to solve tough government challenges in flexible, cost-effective ways.
