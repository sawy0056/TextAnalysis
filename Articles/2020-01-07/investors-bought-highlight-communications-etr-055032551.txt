And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Highlight Communications AG (ETR:HLG) share price is up 26% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 19% (ignoring dividends). See our latest analysis for Highlight Communications While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Highlight Communications managed to grow its earnings per share at 0.5% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 4.7% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).XTRA:HLG Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Highlight Communications's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Highlight Communications's TSR for the last 5 years was 54%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveHighlight Communications shareholders are down 11% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 21%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9.0% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Highlight Communications's dividend track record.
