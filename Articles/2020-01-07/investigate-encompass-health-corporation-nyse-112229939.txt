With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Encompass Health’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Encompass Health What is Encompass Health worth?Great news for investors – Encompass Health is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $92.05, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Encompass Health’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Encompass Health generate?NYSE:EHC Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
