(CVE:GROW) Share Price Tend To Follow The Market?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosIf you're interested in CO2 Gro Inc. (CVE:GROW), then you might want to consider its beta (a measure of share price volatility) in order to understand how the stock could impact your portfolio. Modern finance theory considers volatility to be a measure of risk, and there are two main types of price volatility. The first category is company specific volatility. This can be dealt with by limiting your exposure to any particular stock. The second sort is caused by the natural volatility of markets, overall. For example, certain macroeconomic events will impact (virtually) all stocks on the market.Some stocks mimic the volatility of the market quite closely, while others demonstrate muted, exagerrated or uncorrelated price movements. Beta is a widely used metric to measure a stock's exposure to market risk (volatility). Before we go on, it's worth noting that Warren Buffett pointed out in his 2014 letter to shareholders that 'volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' Having said that, beta can still be rather useful. The first thing to understand about beta is that the beta of the overall market is one. A stock with a beta greater than one is more sensitive to broader market movements than a stock with a beta of less than one. See our latest analysis for CO2 Gro What we can learn from GROW's beta valueGiven that it has a beta of 1.22, we can surmise that the CO2 Gro share price has been fairly sensitive to market volatility (over the last 5 years). If this beta value holds true in the future, CO2 Gro shares are likely to rise more than the market when the market is going up, but fall faster when the market is going down. Beta is worth considering, but it's also important to consider whether CO2 Gro is growing earnings and revenue. You can take a look for yourself, below.TSXV:GROW Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreHow does GROW's size impact its beta?With a market capitalisation of CA$17m, CO2 Gro is a very small company by global standards. It is quite likely to be unknown to most investors. Relatively few investors can influence the price of a smaller company, compared to a large company. This could explain the high beta value, in this case.What this means for you:Beta only tells us that the CO2 Gro share price is sensitive to broader market movements. This could indicate that it is a high growth company, or is heavily influenced by sentiment because it is speculative. Alternatively, it could have operating leverage in its business model. Ultimately, beta is an interesting metric, but there's plenty more to learn. In order to fully understand whether GROW is a good investment for you, we also need to consider important company-specific fundamentals such as CO2 Gro’s financial health and performance track record.
