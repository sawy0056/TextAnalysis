Embrace academic coursesView photosGetty ImagesWhether studying Shakespeare or statistics (or hopefully both), academic work must be the centerpiece of any student's college experience. It may seem like simple advice, but far too many students take the path of least resistance and/or take classes in one narrow corner of the college. This is the time to be rigorous. Sign up for a wide range of challenging classes and take advantage of being fully engaged in each of them. Find joy and power in the books you read, the classes you attend and the papers you write. This should be priority one.SEE ALSO: 10 Financial Commandments for Your 20s2. Choose co-curricular activities wiselyView photosGetty ImagesCo-curricular activities, like student organizations, student government, campus newspapers, athletics and arts organizations, offer fun and learning, but students tend to get overly involved or not involved at all. Get involved in something you are already interested in, and stretch yourself by pursuing a new interest. Remember, learning comes to those who value depth, commitment and excellence -- not just keeping busy.Story continuesSEE ALSO: The Millionaire Quiz: Do You Have What It Takes?3. Make room for cultural and intellectual eventsView photosGetty ImagesLectures, plays, concerts, art openings and panel conversations are just a few of the extraordinary events that fill college campuses. Too many students don't take advantage of the range of cultural and intellectual events to expand their minds, imagination and world views.

Explore careers earlyView photosGetty ImagesCollege should help you develop ideas for the kind of life you want to live, give you an understanding of how careers allow people to build lives and help you acquire the skills, values, habits, networks and experiences to successfully get started post-graduation. Use three of the suggestions above -- courses, co-curricular activities, and campus events -- to examine unfamiliar topics and identify your interests and passions. Also, visit your career service center early (don't wait until late in your senior year) and get to know some alumni. They are the ones that may give you jobs later. Seek out internships and other career-related programs. Study abroad for a semester. All of this is critical in the era of globalization.SEE ALSO: 25 Best College Majors for a Lucrative Career5. Develop a wide set of friendshipsView photosGetty ImagesCollege campuses represent one of the few places in the country where people are living across class, race, ethnic backgrounds, political ideology and religious views. Proactively seek out friendships across differences. Learning to read cultures and/or work in diverse teams is a 21st century skill across the professions. In class, if someone expresses a view that makes you uncomfortable, ask them out for coffee. Your ability to learn from those who see the world differently and/or resolve conflicts will serve you well in your work life. You'll be surprised by what may unfold.SEE ALSO: 10 Money Mistakes Millennials Should Avoid (No. 10's a Shocker)6.

Their recommendations could make the difference early in your career.SEE ALSO: How Well Do You Know 529 Plans?7.

Many colleges offer classes and students are using apps like Calm, 10% Happier and Headspace. Figure out what keeps you healthy. College is a place to learn the habits to manage and thrive in a busy, competitive and challenging world.
