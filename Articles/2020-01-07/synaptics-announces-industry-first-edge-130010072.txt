Combined with the ongoing transfer of personal data associated with cloud processes, and the actual personal benefits of using smart devices, consumers are struggling to be inspired by promises of manufactures and service providers. This has led to the increased need for edge-based processing of smart home systems.”Kozak added, “Home security cameras and smart speakers that historically relied on the cloud will soon have significant functionality done right at the edge, bringing more security and peace of mind to consumers. Although some cloud interfaces will be needed for home automation features, especially connections with external sources such as asking for a weather forecast, it is expected that advanced processes will move from a cloud infrastructure to being done locally in the home where device-to-device communication, computer vision, and machine learning will improve the user experience. This will be apparent at CES 2020 and for the remainder of year.”“Synaptics’ VS600 family represents a new era for consumer technology as we can now deploy low cost SoCs with powerful neural network compute accelerators and video with voice functionality into smart displays, security cameras, as well as service operator and retail streaming devices,” said Saleel Awsare, SVP & GM, IoT Division at Synaptics. “This leap forward is driving our vision of ambient computing and will make the human-machine interaction more seamless, useful and private.”Availability:
