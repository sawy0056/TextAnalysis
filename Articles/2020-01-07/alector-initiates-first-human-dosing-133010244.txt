(ALEC), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering immuno-neurology, today announced that in December 2019, it initiated dosing in healthy volunteers in its Phase 1 study of AL101, an investigational product candidate designed to increase progranulin levels. The Phase 1 study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of AL101 in healthy volunteers, as well as the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and bioavailability of intravenously and subcutaneously administered doses of AL101.AL101 is Alector’s second product candidate targeting the progranulin pathway to enter the clinic in the last two years.“Progranulin is a regulator of immune activity in the brain. Human genetics have shown that even moderately reduced progranulin expression may lead to an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. We strongly believe that increasing progranulin in the brain of patients suffering from these diseases may counteract disease pathology,” said Robert Paul, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Alector.“This study will pave the way for exploring multiple indications for progranulin therapy as well as delivery formulations of this novel investigational medicine. The results will inform our decisions on future development of AL101 for neurodegeneration,” said Robert King, Ph.D., chief development officer of Alector.The Phase 1 study of AL101 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial expected to enroll up to 42 healthy volunteers at a clinical study site in the United States. The ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier for the AL101 study is: NCT04111666.About AL101AL101 is Alector’s wholly-owned human monoclonal antibody and second product designed to increase progranulin, a regulator of immune activity in the brain with genetic links to multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations that moderately reduce the expression levels of progranulin have been shown to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, and increased progranulin levels have been demonstrated to be protective for these diseases in animal models.AL101 has the potential to be developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. AL101 received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of FTD in July 2019.About AlectorAlector is a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering immuno-neurology, a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Immuno-neurology targets immune dysfunction as a root cause of multiple pathologies that are drivers of degenerative brain disorders. Alector is developing a broad portfolio of programs designed to functionally repair genetic mutations that cause dysfunction of the brain’s immune system and enable the rejuvenated immune cells to counteract emerging brain pathologies. The Company’s product candidates are supported by biomarkers and target genetically defined patient populations in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Alector is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.
