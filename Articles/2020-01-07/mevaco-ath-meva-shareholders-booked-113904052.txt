But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the Mevaco S.A. (ATH:MEVA) share price is up 94% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 38% (not including dividends). View our latest analysis for Mevaco While Mevaco made a small profit, in the last year, we think that the market is probably more focussed on the top line growth at the moment. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.In the last 3 years Mevaco saw its revenue shrink by 13% per year. Despite the lack of revenue growth, the stock has returned 25%, compound, over three years. Unless the company is going to make profits soon, we would be pretty cautious about it.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).ATSE:MEVA Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at Mevaco's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered Mevaco's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Its history of dividend payouts mean that Mevaco's TSR of 102% over the last 3 years is better than the share price return.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Mevaco shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 82% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
