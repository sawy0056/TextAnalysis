The Coinbase CEO predicts a scenario where BTC will reach $200,000 and more than half of the world’s billionaires will have their fortunes in crypto.This theory was made popular by Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan, who are good friends of Armstrong.Discussing the potential effects of such a scenario, Armstrong shared: “It would mean that more pro-technology people will have access to large amounts of capital in the 2020s. Presumably, this will increase the amount of investment made in science and technology, and I think we’ll also see more crypto folks turn to philanthropy.” Despite Coinbase’s role as a trading platform and exchange, Armstrong has long been a proponent of blockchain utility, and has previously indicated a wish to move beyond trading and drive innovation.The post Coinbase CEO reveals top crypto predictions for the next decade appeared first on Coin Rivet.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHouse committee to explore benefits of blockchain for small businesses next weekThe BlockSteven Seagal settles with SEC over undisclosed bitcoin promotionsEngadgetDusk Network Plans to Tokenize Equity for Thousands of Dutch CompaniesCoindeskMillennials & Gen Z to Drive Gaming Industry: 5 Stocks to WatchZacksStellar Invests in Security Token Platform Targeting Developing MarketsCoindeskBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
