But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Interpump Group S.p.A. (BIT:IP) share price has soared 144% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. We note the stock price is up 1.8% in the last seven days. Check out our latest analysis for Interpump Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Interpump Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 24% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 20% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).BIT:IP Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreDive deeper into Interpump Group's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Interpump Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Interpump Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 156%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveInterpump Group shareholders gained a total return of 7.3% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 21% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. Is Interpump Group cheap compared to other companies?
