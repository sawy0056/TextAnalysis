To keep it practical, we'll show how Merck & Co., Inc.'s (NYSE:MRK) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Merck has a price to earnings ratio of 25.31, based on the last twelve months. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying $25.31 for every $1 in prior year profit. Check out our latest analysis for Merck How Do You Calculate Merck's P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Merck:P/E of 25.31 = $91.25 ÷ $3.61 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Merck's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. As you can see below, Merck has a higher P/E than the average company (18.1) in the pharmaceuticals industry.NYSE:MRK Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreMerck's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Merck's 190% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. And earnings per share have improved by 22% annually, over the last three years. So you might say it really deserves to have an above-average P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does Merck's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Merck has net debt worth just 7.8% of its market capitalization. It would probably trade on a higher P/E ratio if it had a lot of cash, but I doubt it is having a big impact.The Verdict On Merck's P/E RatioMerck trades on a P/E ratio of 25.3, which is above its market average of 18.9. While the company does use modest debt, its recent earnings growth is superb. So to be frank we are not surprised it has a high P/E ratio.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
