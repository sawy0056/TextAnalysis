Among its discoveries are three clinical-stage therapeutics: mavacamten (formerly MYK-461) in Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM); MYK-491 in Phase 2 for patients with stable heart failure; and MYK-224 in Phase 1 development for HCM.  MyoKardia’s mission is to change the world for people with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.Contacts: Michelle Corral Corporate Communications & Investor RelationsMyoKardia, Inc.650-351-4690mcorral@myokardia.comHannah Deresiewicz (investors)Stern Investor Relations, Inc.212-362-1200hannah.deresiewicz@sternir.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBaidu Becomes Latest Tech Giant to Deliver Disappointing OutlookBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
