But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Retelit S.p.A. (BIT:LIT) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 179% in five years. Then again, the 8.2% share price decline hasn't been so fun for shareholders. View our latest analysis for Retelit There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last half decade, Retelit became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).BIT:LIT Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreDive deeper into Retelit's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Retelit's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Retelit, it has a TSR of 186% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveRetelit shareholders gained a total return of 15% during the year. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 23% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market.
