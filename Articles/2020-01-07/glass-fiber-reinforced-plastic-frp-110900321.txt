The major drivers for growth in this market are increasing demand for lightweight materials in the transportation industry; corrosion and chemical resistance materials demand in construction and pipe & tank industry; electrical resistivity and high flame retardant materials demand in electrical and electronics industry.
An emerging trend, which has a direct impact on the dynamics of the glass fiber reinforced plastic industry, includes penetration of low dielectric glass fiber in high-performance PCB.Some of the glass fiber reinforced plastic companies profiled in this report include Owens Corning, Jushi Group Co., Ltd., Chongqing Polycarp International Corporation (CPIC), Taishan Fiberglass Inc., Nippon Electric Glass Co., Ltd., and others.The study includes the glass fiber reinforced plastic market size and forecast for the glass fiber reinforced plastic market through 2024, segmented by end-use industry, resin type, manufacturing process, glass fiber type, and by region.Within the glass fiber reinforced plastic market, injection molding, hand layup, compression molding, spray-up, filament winding, resin infusion, and prepreg layup are some of the major processes utilized to manufacture composite parts. Injection molding is expected to be the largest process in terms of value and volume in composite manufacturing because of low cycle time, low manufacturing cost, and the ability to make complex shapes.Within the glass fiber reinforced plastic market, transportation will remain the largest market by value and volume and it is also expected to witness in the highest growth over the forecast period. Government regulations, such as CAFE Standards in the US and carbon emission targets in Europe, are putting pressure on OEMs to incorporate lightweight materials to curb the overall vehicle weight, and this is the key driver for glass fiber in the transportation industry. The Asia-Pacific is expected to remain the largest region by value and volume and it is also expected to experience the highest growth over the forecast period because of growth in construction, transportation, and the electrical and electronics segments. rowing economy, growth in population, and urbanization are the major forces that drive the construction segment, especially in China and India.Some features of this report include:Market size estimates:
