And so the S&P 500 still hasn’t declined more than 1% since early October. And financial markets seem to have begun 2020 with the same resilience we grew accustomed to in 2019.That markets faded the negative geopolitical developments that sprung up out of nowhere late Thursday, however, should not come as a total surprise. Not only does the character of this market suggest a weak open would be bought, but geopolitical events in general tend not to be major long-term market events.“Geopolitical events by their nature are unpredictable, but previous periods of increased tensions suggest that the impact on wider markets tend to be short-lived,” said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for global wealth management at UBS. “More lasting effects [are] confined to local markets and assets that are directly impacted by the tensions.”Oil prices spiked higher on Friday, finishing the session up some 2.2%. But even this move underwhelmed relative to how a potential closing of the Strait of Hormuz would have previously been received by investors.Capital Economics, for instance, said Friday that they’ve previously estimated a closing of the Strait would push oil prices up towards $150 a barrel. This indicates prices that could more than double from Friday’s level and make the 3% jump to finish the week seem paltry by comparison.Iranian men monitor the stock market at Tehran Stock Exchange on July 1, 2019.

One, that this will not be a full-scale war. And secondly, that the Fed is on the sideline and will intervene if there’s too much market volatility.”And so while all the details are different, investors eventually begin 2020 where we left off 2019: Betting on the Fed and betting against events that might upset this bull run in the months ahead.By Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round. Follow him @MylesUdlandRead more Top NewsGulf markets plunge on U.S.-Iran tensions, Aramco at lowest since IPO [Reuters]What heightened US-Iran tensions could mean for oil prices [Yahoo Finance]China's services sector expands at slower pace in December as confidence dips [Reuters]Rep.
