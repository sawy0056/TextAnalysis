Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether KB Home's current trading price of US$34.91 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at KB Home’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for KB Home What is KB Home worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 10% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy KB Home today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $38.92, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since KB Home’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of KB Home look like?NYSE:KBH Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. KB Home’s earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 32%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? KBH’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on KBH, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
