But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. To wit, the Haitian International Holdings Limited (HKG:1882) share price is 30% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 9.7% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! Longer term, the stock is up 25% in three years. Check out our latest analysis for Haitian International Holdings To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over the last twelve months, Haitian International Holdings actually shrank its EPS by 26%.Given the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.Haitian International Holdings's revenue actually dropped 9.5% over last year. So using a snapshot of key business metrics doesn't give us a good picture of why the market is bidding up the stock.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SEHK:1882 Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. You can see what analysts are predicting for Haitian International Holdings in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Haitian International Holdings the TSR over the last year was 34%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Haitian International Holdings has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 34% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 7.4%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
