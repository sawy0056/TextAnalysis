Understanding how Matas performed requires a benchmark rather than trying to assess a standalone number at one point in time. Below is a quick commentary on how I see MATAS has performed. Check out our latest analysis for Matas Did MATAS perform worse than its track record and industry?MATAS's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 30 September 2019) of ø228m has declined by -17% compared to the previous year.Furthermore, this one-year growth rate has been lower than its average earnings growth rate over the past 5 years of -6.3%, indicating the rate at which MATAS is growing has slowed down. Why is this? Well, let's look at what's transpiring with margins and whether the whole industry is facing the same headwind.CPSE:MATAS Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreIn terms of returns from investment, Matas has fallen short of achieving a 20% return on equity (ROE), recording 8.6% instead. Furthermore, its return on assets (ROA) of 4.0% is below the DK Specialty Retail industry of 4.1%, indicating Matas's are utilized less efficiently. And finally, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for Matas’s debt level, has declined over the past 3 years from 11% to 6.3%.What does this mean?Matas's track record can be a valuable insight into its earnings performance, but it certainly doesn't tell the whole story. Usually companies that endure a prolonged period of diminishing earnings are undergoing some sort of reinvestment phase Although, if the entire industry is struggling to grow over time, it may be a signal of a structural change, which makes Matas and its peers a higher risk investment.
