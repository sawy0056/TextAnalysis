That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.How Does Raymond Industrial's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. As you can see below Raymond Industrial has a P/E ratio that is fairly close for the average for the consumer durables industry, which is 13.0.SEHK:229 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreThat indicates that the market expects Raymond Industrial will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. The company could surprise by performing better than average, in the future. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future.

And EPS is down 13% a year, over the last 3 years. This might lead to low expectations.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting Raymond Industrial's P/E?With net cash of HK$210m, Raymond Industrial has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 47% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On Raymond Industrial's P/E RatioRaymond Industrial trades on a P/E ratio of 13.7, which is above its market average of 10.7. The recent drop in earnings per share might keep value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth.
