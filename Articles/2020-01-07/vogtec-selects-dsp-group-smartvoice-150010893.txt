The combination of high-performance low-power voice processing hardware and algorithms enabled far-field voice control and clear two-way voice calls despite high ambient noise environments and difficult conversation conditions.Called the Cybic AI Bicycle, the SmartBike is the first pedal-assist electric bicycle to have built-in support for voice control and user interaction and offers hands-free interaction with the bicycle’s computer system. This system comprises a built-in LTE interface and Wi-Fi hotspot capability, GPS tracking, cycling sensors, connected head and tail lights and, and smart LED lane lighting.“The addition of VUI capability to bicycles is another exciting and innovative application of our SmartVoice voice and audio processing capabilities that can completely change the cycling paradigm,” said Yosi Brosh, CVP Smart Voice at DSP Group. “We are delighted Vogtec chose our SmartVoice far-field voice SoC with HDClear to make cycling safer and more enjoyable for individuals, families, and groups.”Cybic, a division of Vogtec that specializes in AI-enabled sports, offers the complete bicycle as well as a separate navigation unit with a built-in VUI. Using the VUI, cyclists can make handsfree calls, communicate with each other more clearly in groups, and verbally interact with their bike to plan routes, track progress and schedule breaks at known landmarks. More commercial cloud-based applications include tourist navigation features, restaurant delivery, and public bike rental.“The Cybic AI Bicycle will change the cycling experience, using localized and cloud-based technology to ensure safety, track movement and physical fitness, and enable a host of new and as yet-to-be imagined commercial services,” said Lawrence Lau, CEO at Vogtec. “By working with DSP Group, we were able to quickly and effectively integrate power- and performance-optimized VUI capability to ensure the best possible user experience.”The Cybic AI Bicycle will be exhibited during CES (Las Vegas, Jan 7 – 10) in DSP Group’s Private meeting room, along with a select array of the many products powered by DSP Group’s technologies.
