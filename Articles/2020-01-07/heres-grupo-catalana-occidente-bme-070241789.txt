is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Grupo Catalana Occidente:P/E of 9.71 = €31.40 ÷ €3.23 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each €1 of company earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Grupo Catalana Occidente Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company.

If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Most would be impressed by Grupo Catalana Occidente earnings growth of 10% in the last year.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does Grupo Catalana Occidente's Balance Sheet Tell Us?With net cash of €1.2b, Grupo Catalana Occidente has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 31% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On Grupo Catalana Occidente's P/E RatioGrupo Catalana Occidente trades on a P/E ratio of 9.7, which is below the ES market average of 17.1. It grew its EPS nicely over the last year, and the healthy balance sheet implies there is more potential for growth. The relatively low P/E ratio implies the market is pessimistic.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
