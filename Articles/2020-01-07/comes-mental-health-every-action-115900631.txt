The theme of this year's Bell Let's Talk Day campaign is Mental Health: Every Action Counts, and we hope you can join the discussion about how we can all take action to create positive change for Canadians who live with mental illness."I look forward to joining with Canadians and people around the world as we celebrate the 10th annual Bell Let's Talk Day and talk about the actions big and small we can all take to drive positive change in mental health," said Mirko Bibic , President and CEO of Bell. "2020 promises to be another year of progress in Canadian mental health, the first in a new decade of heightened awareness of the impact of mental illness and of the opportunities to make a real and enduring difference.""Canada has come a long way over the last decade in de-stigmatizing mental illness and increasing awareness of how it affects all of us," said Mary Deacon , Chair of Bell Let's Talk. "We can build on our progress by focusing on the real-world actions we can all take to support mental health in our communities, schools and workplaces. We can learn from trailblazers and from each other about how to make a difference, as individuals or in groups, for others or for our own mental health."Mental Health: Every Action CountsWith a nationwide multimedia campaign, this year's Bell Let's Talk Day theme highlights the ways we can convert awareness and acceptance into action. Whether by institutions or individuals – setting up one-stop-shops for young people to access mental health, wellness and social services, organizing your community or team to advocate for better access to care, supporting someone who struggles with kind gestures and other support, advocating for a family member, making your voice heard on social media, or even just taking the time to care for our own mental health – we can all take action to support people living with mental illness.The Bell Let's Talk Day campaign also features the work of 8 outstanding Canadian organizations providing frontline access to mental health services throughout the country: the Canadian Mental Health Association, Canadian Red Cross, Foundry, Jack.org, Kids Help Phone, Revivre, St. John Ambulance and Strongest Families Institute."Kids Help Phone is very proud to be part of this year's Bell Let's Talk campaign.
