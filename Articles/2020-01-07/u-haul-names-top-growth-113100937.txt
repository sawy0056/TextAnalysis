Migration trends data is compiled from more than 2 million one-way U-Haul truck-sharing transactions that occur annually.Although U-Haul migration trends do not correlate directly to population or economic growth, the Company's growth data is an effective gauge of how well cities and states are attracting and maintaining residents."Florida has been showing signs of growth for a decade," said Miguel Caminos, U-Haul Company of Orlando president. "Central Florida is really booming. I can't think of any major suburb where there aren't home developments or new shopping centers being built."There's an expectation of comfort for people moving here. They know there are jobs. Plus, there are tons of attractions, and our state is family-friendly. The weather is perfect, and no matter where you live, you're less than an hour from the beach."Florida arrivals of one-way U-Haul trucks increased 1% while departures were down 1% compared to the state's 2018 numbers. Arrivals accounted for 50.6% of all one-way U-Haul traffic in the state.Kissimmee, Ocala, West Palm Beach, Port Saint Lucie and the Bradenton-Sarasota corridor lead Florida's gains. Boca Raton, Ft. Lauderdale, Pensacola, Miami and St. Petersburg are among the other notable cities to see a net increase of U-Haul trucks.Alabama was the biggest year-over-year climber in the rankings, surging 36 spots to No. 6. Maryland took the largest tumble, backsliding 39 spots to No. 45.

"We're Floridians – we don't leave. Our communities stick together. We banded together and U-Haul gave free self-storage to affected residents. Our neighbors are our family."U-Haul is the authority on migration trends thanks to its expansive network that blankets all 50 states and 10 Canadian provinces.
