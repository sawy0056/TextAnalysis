To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Société de Services, de Participations, de Direction et d'Elaboration (EBR:SPA).Société de Services de Participations de Direction et d'Elaboration has a ROE of 20%, based on the last twelve months. That means that for every €1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated €0.20 in profit. View our latest analysis for Société de Services de Participations de Direction et d'Elaboration How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Société de Services de Participations de Direction et d'Elaboration:20% = €40m ÷ €201m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does Return On Equity Mean?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Société de Services de Participations de Direction et d'Elaboration Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Société de Services de Participations de Direction et d'Elaboration has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the Beverage industry.ENXTBR:SPA Past Revenue and Net Income, January 6th 2020MoreThat is a good sign. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. For example, I often check if insiders have been buying shares.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Société de Services de Participations de Direction et d'Elaboration's Debt And Its 20% ROESociété de Services de Participations de Direction et d'Elaboration has a debt to equity ratio of just 0.07, which is very low. The fact that it achieved a fairly good ROE with only modest debt suggests the business might be worth putting on your watchlist. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
