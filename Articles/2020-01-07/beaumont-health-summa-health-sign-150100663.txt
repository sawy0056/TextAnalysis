SummaCare, Summa's health insurance operation, will remain an integral part of Summa, and the organizations will work together to identify opportunities to drive future expansion."Over the past few months, our team has spent a considerable amount of time with the Beaumont team," Summa Board Chair Anthony Lockhart said.
