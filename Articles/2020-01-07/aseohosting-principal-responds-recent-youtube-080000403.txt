Bloomberg notes that the real reason behind this has nothing to do with children and families. Rather, it speculates it's simply an attempt to appease the Federal Trade Commission (FCC), targeting primarily channels that produce animated children's content.Some channels have seen significant spikes in viewership, while others have suffered a considerable downturn. At the time of writing, there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason as to what the algorithm targets, although Bloomberg has speculated that its focus is on animated videos."YouTube parent company Alphabet has been vague regarding its reasoning behind which videos it deems acceptable and which ones it buries," said Daniel Page, Director of Business Development at ASEOHosting."Unfortunately, that means that for content creators, there's little to be done at this stage," he continued. "The only good news is that if your channel isn't focused on kid-friendly content, you may not suffer as much with the update. The video creators who were most significantly impacted were those who already market to younger demographics."User YouTube feeds have been overtaken with family-friendly content that was largely irrelevant to them, according to digital media publication The Verge. A few channels also attempted to exploit the new algorithm, pumping out low-quality nursery rhyme videos with keyword-stuffed titles.The best thing for any content creators, says Page, is to simply focus on publishing well-made videos geared towards their target audience."There's little that can be done about algorithm updates like this one," Page said. "That's the reality of operating on the modern web. I have little doubt that YouTube will eventually reach some form of equilibrium with the most recent changes."About ASEOHosting: Launched in 2002, ASEOHosting is a leader in providing SEO Hosting, including Shared SEO Hosting, Dedicated SEO Hosting, US Dedicated SEO Servers, and EU Dedicated SEO Servers.
