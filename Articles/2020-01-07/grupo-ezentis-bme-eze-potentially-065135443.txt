(BME:EZE) Potentially Undervalued?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosGrupo Ezentis, S.A. (BME:EZE), which is in the communications business, and is based in Spain, saw significant share price movement during recent months on the BME, rising to highs of €0.52 and falling to the lows of €0.40. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Grupo Ezentis's current trading price of €0.42 reflective of the actual value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Grupo Ezentis’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Grupo Ezentis What is Grupo Ezentis worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 15% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Grupo Ezentis today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is €0.49, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Grupo Ezentis’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Grupo Ezentis?BME:EZE Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
