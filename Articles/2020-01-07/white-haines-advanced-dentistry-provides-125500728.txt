They now welcome new patients with or without a referral.DAVIDSON, N.C., Jan. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Drs. Steven White, Brad Haines, and Colton Fischer, the respected dentists at White and Haines Advanced Dentistry, provide gum disease treatment options for patients in Davidson, NC. Depending on the severity of the gum disease, the doctors offer scaling and root planing (or periodontal therapy), local antibiotic placement, and gingivectomies. Their commitment to offering these effective treatments gives gum disease sufferers the solutions they need to take charge of their oral healthcare.Gum disease occurs when bacteria builds in the area between the gums and the teeth. Over time, the bacteria eat away at healthy soft and hard tissues, causing an infection that will continue unless the patient seeks dental intervention. As gum disease advances, the gums pull away from the teeth and supporting gum tissues are destroyed. When this occurs, bone can be lost and the teeth may loosen or eventually fall out.Some of the warning signs of gum disease include chronic bad breath, swollen and red gums and gums that regularly bleed. Drs. White, Haines, and Fischer recommend that patients experiencing these symptoms seek treatment due to the effect gum disease has on a person's overall health. In fact, researchers are finding links between periodontal disease and systemic diseases like diabetes, heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis.Periodontal therapy offers a non-surgical method of removing the bacteria that cause gum disease. With scaling and root planing, the dentists use ultrasonic tools and hand instruments to remove diseased tissues and harmful bacteria before gum disease can cause irreversible damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and bone. Local antibiotic placement helps keep gum disease sites free from increasing bacteria. In some cases, gum tissue may become infected and need to be removed in order to prevent further infection. Gingivectomies restore the look and function of the gums by removing this diseased tissue and restoring proper oral health.Early detection of gum disease is the best way to ward off significant health concerns.
