We'll show how you can use Hexagon AB (publ)'s (STO:HEXA B) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Based on the last twelve months, Hexagon's P/E ratio is 25.42. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 3.9%. Check out our latest analysis for Hexagon How Do You Calculate Hexagon's P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price (in reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Hexagon:P/E of 25.42 = SEK50.29 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, EUR ) ÷ SEK1.98 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Hexagon Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. As you can see below Hexagon has a P/E ratio that is fairly close for the average for the electronic industry, which is 24.2.OM:HEXA B Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreThat indicates that the market expects Hexagon will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. So if Hexagon actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Hexagon shrunk earnings per share by 7.9% last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 13%.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does Hexagon's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Hexagon has net debt worth just 10.0% of its market capitalization. So it doesn't have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On Hexagon's P/E RatioHexagon's P/E is 25.4 which is above average (19.3) in its market. With a bit of debt, but a lack of recent growth, it's safe to say the market is expecting improved profit performance from the company, in the next few years.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
