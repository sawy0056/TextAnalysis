(NYSE:CBU) Could Be Worth WatchingSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosCommunity Bank System, Inc. (NYSE:CBU), operating in the financial services industry based in United States, saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Community Bank System’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Community Bank System What is Community Bank System worth?According to my valuation model, Community Bank System seems to be fairly priced at around 9.73% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Community Bank System today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $64.31, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Community Bank System’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Community Bank System generate?NYSE:CBU Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations.

It seems like the market has already priced in CBU’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team.

Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CBU, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.
