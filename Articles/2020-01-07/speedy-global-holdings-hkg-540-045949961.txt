But you want to avoid the really big losses like the plague. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of Speedy Global Holdings Limited (HKG:540), who have seen the share price tank a massive 80% over a three year period. That'd be enough to cause even the strongest minds some disquiet. But it's up 5.3% in the last week. View our latest analysis for Speedy Global Holdings While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Speedy Global Holdings saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 10% per year, over the last three years. The share price decline of 42% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 6.83.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SEHK:540 Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreDive deeper into Speedy Global Holdings's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Speedy Global Holdings's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered Speedy Global Holdings's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Speedy Global Holdings shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 79%, over the last 3 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Speedy Global Holdings had a tough year, with a total loss of 14% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 14%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 13% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
