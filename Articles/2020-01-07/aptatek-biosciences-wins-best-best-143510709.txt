One such disease is Phenylketonuria (PKU), which causes a buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine and can result in intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders if not well managed. Once diagnosed, typically at birth, PKU patients must closely monitor their phenylalanine levels using expensive and slow central lab tests for their entire lifetimes to help manage potentially severe health challenges. Aptatek’s monitoring device, allowing patients to test their phenylalanine levels at home, could be game changing for thousands of people affected by PKU because it provides clinical grade testing in an easy-to-use, portable device. "Aptatek's lab-at-home testing platform for chronic disease monitoring is fully-consistent with the ongoing trend toward lower-cost, home-based health care and has the potential to change the way the patients and physicians manage chronic disease," added Jon Popke, angel investor and MABA Steering Committee Member.About AptatekAptatek is a digital health company developing a novel patient-directed home monitoring system for chronic diseases ranging from inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria to chronic kidney disease.  The privately held company is a spin out of Columbia University and is based in Princeton, New Jersey.About 1st Pitch Life Science 1st Pitch Life Science (http://www.1stpitchlifescience.com) is a program initiated by Mid Atlantic Bio Angels to educate early stage life science and healthcare companies and an audience consisting of life science ecosystem participants about how angel investing works.  Although specific formats vary, at each event at least three early stage companies present a pitch deck and experienced investors provide either one-on-one coaching or direct constructive feedback intended to help the companies improve their chances of getting investment.  The audience members vote on “Best in Show”.  In all cases, the companies receive constructive criticism of the company’s presentation, business model and perceived viability in the market. At the end of each year, the “Best in Show” winners compete against each other for the title of “Best of the Best.”About MABA Mid Atlantic Bio Angels (http://bioangels.net) is a group of active angel investors, which meets in New York City monthly (except July and August) solely to hear from pre-screened early-stage life science companies.
