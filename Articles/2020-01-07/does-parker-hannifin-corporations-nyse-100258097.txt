Understanding how Parker-Hannifin performed requires a benchmark rather than trying to assess a standalone number at one point in time. Below is a quick commentary on how I see PH has performed. Check out our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin Were PH's earnings stronger than its past performances and the industry?PH's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 30 September 2019) of US$1.5b has jumped 28% compared to the previous year.Furthermore, this one-year growth rate has exceeded its 5-year annual growth average of 8.5%, indicating the rate at which PH is growing has accelerated. What's enabled this growth? Let's see whether it is merely because of industry tailwinds, or if Parker-Hannifin has experienced some company-specific growth.NYSE:PH Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreIn terms of returns from investment, Parker-Hannifin has invested its equity funds well leading to a 24% return on equity (ROE), above the sensible minimum of 20%. Furthermore, its return on assets (ROA) of 8.5% exceeds the US Machinery industry of 7.2%, indicating Parker-Hannifin has used its assets more efficiently. However, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for Parker-Hannifin’s debt level, has declined over the past 3 years from 14% to 13%. This correlates with an increase in debt holding, with debt-to-equity ratio rising from 33% to 149% over the past 5 years.What does this mean?Parker-Hannifin's track record can be a valuable insight into its earnings performance, but it certainly doesn't tell the whole story.
