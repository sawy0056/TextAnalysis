If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.While ASM Pacific Technology's 2.5% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis SEHK:522 Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. ASM Pacific Technology paid out 179% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, from the perspective of an investor who hopes to own the company for many years, a payout ratio of above 100% is definitely a concern.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. ASM Pacific Technology paid out 58% of its free cash flow last year, which is acceptable, but is starting to limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested into the business. It's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and ASM Pacific Technology fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Extraordinarily few companies are capable of persistently paying a dividend that is greater than their profits.Is ASM Pacific Technology's Balance Sheet Risky?As ASM Pacific Technology's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). ASM Pacific Technology has net debt of 0.45 times its EBITDA, which we think is not too troublesome.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Net interest cover of 6.86 times its interest expense appears reasonable for ASM Pacific Technology, although we're conscious that even high interest cover doesn't make a company bulletproof.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of ASM Pacific Technology's latest financial position,

Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of ASM Pacific Technology's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was HK$1.90 in 2010, compared to HK$2.80 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.0% a year over that time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.Story continuesIt's good to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth, anyway. We're not that enthused by this.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. ASM Pacific Technology's earnings per share have been essentially flat over the past five years. Over the long term, steady earnings per share is a risk as the value of the dividends can be reduced by inflation. Still, the company has struggled to grow its EPS, and currently pays out 179% of its earnings. As they say in finance, 'past performance is not indicative of future performance', but we are not confident a company with limited earnings growth and a high payout ratio will be a star dividend-payer over the next decade.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that ASM Pacific Technology's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. We're a bit uncomfortable with its high payout ratio, although at least the dividend was covered by free cash flow. Unfortunately, the company has not been able to generate earnings growth, and cut its dividend at least once in the past. In summary, ASM Pacific Technology has a number of shortcomings that we'd find it hard to get past. Things could change, but we think there are likely more attractive alternatives out there.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
