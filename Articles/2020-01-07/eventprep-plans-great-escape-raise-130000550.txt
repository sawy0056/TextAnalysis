At the onset of their meeting, EventPrep franchisees hosted a creative fund-raising event to benefit the Meetings Industry Fund called "The Great Escape".Upon check-in, each EventPrep franchisee was served a very official looking summons to appear at a designated place and time, and was subsequently greeted by the event "prison warden," Steve Davis, President / COO, EventPrep, Inc. It was at this time they learned their fate: Each franchisee was "sentenced" to serve time in a make-shift jail until such time they could raise enough bail money to bust them out.Donned in prison attire, complete with a plastic ball and chain ankle bracelet, each franchisee was armed only with their cell phones, their contact list and a pledge sheet. Their task was to call their friends, family and business contacts to raise as much bail money they could within 60 minutes; with 100% of every donation going directly to The Meetings Industry Fund."The hospitality industry is relationship driven, so we couldn't think of a better way to leverage our relationships to benefit such a worthy cause," said Paul Trapp, founder and CEO of EventPrep. "We chose The Meetings Industry Fund because they do so much to help our industry brothers and sisters in need."Time passed quickly with one phone call after another, pledges pouring in, with only minutes left on the one-hour clock. When it was all done and said, the EventPrep franchisees proudly raised a grand total of $5,000!"We are very grateful to the EventPrep team as the monies they raised will help several hospitality professionals who are facing dire situations," said Gary Schirmacher, CMP, Chairman, The Meetings Industry Fund. "Supporters like, EventPrep, are critical to our mission of helping those in desperate need."About EventPrep® Founded in 2016 by military veterans, EventPrep is a full-service event and meeting planning management company headquartered in Central Florida with franchise owners located throughout the U.S. EventPrep's focus is to eliminate the anxiety and frustration of researching, planning, and delivering conferences by making the business of event planning and management streamlined, simple and efficient for the client.
