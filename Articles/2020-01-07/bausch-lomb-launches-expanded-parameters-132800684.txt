"With the additional parameters of Biotrue® ONEday for Astigmatism lenses, more of my patients will be able to experience the benefits that this toric lens offers, including all-day comfort and convenience," said Mile Brujic , O.D., Premier Vision Group, Bowling Green, OH . "Finding a solution for patients with astigmatism was once a barrier. However, given the advancements in technology and the expansion of parameters such as those seen in Biotrue® ONEday for Astigmatism lenses, we can now provide patients the comfort and quality of vision they expect and deserve with a daily disposable toric lens."Similar to the other products in the Biotrue® ONEday brand family, Biotrue® ONEday for Astigmatism lenses are formulated with a patented dehydration barrier, which allows the lens to maintain nearly 100 percent of its moisture for a full 16 hours.1 Biotrue® ONEday for Astigmatism contact lenses also offer an evolved peri-ballast design, featuring a tapered edge to limit lid interaction, and spherical aberration control to help reduce halos and glare, particularly in low light conditions. For more information on the full family of Biotrue® ONEday contact lenses, including how eye care professionals and patients can properly recycle these lenses and their packaging through the Bausch + Lomb ONE by ONE Recycling program, visit www.biotrueonedaylenses.com.About Bausch + LombBausch + Lomb, a leading global eye health business of Bausch Health Companies Inc., is solely focused on helping people see better to live better.
