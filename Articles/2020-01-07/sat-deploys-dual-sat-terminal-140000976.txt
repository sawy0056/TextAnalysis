The innovative solution employs Get SAT's lightweight micronized Milli SAT LM terminals using Inmarsat's worldwide Global Xpress Ka-band network. The solution significantly reduces installation costs and efficiently manages communications-on-the-move. Dual SAT system – Visuals are for illustration purposes onlyMore Dual SAT provides an antenna diversity solution for mobility platforms where obstructions such as ship's superstructures would cause blockage for a single antenna system. A fully automated software switching system that requires no external components, Dual SAT's two terminals operate redundantly as a single system to ensure complete high-speed connectivity. When the primary antenna is blocked, the alternate antenna is switched seamlessly to provide services. This solution is ideal for the roll on, roll off requirements of Special Operations and Executive Staff onboard Afloat Forward Staging Bases (AFSB). Based on the micronized, ruggedized and portable Milli SAT terminal replacing large and bulky alternatives consisting of multi-modem and control units, the solution leverages Get SAT's highly efficient flat panel antenna technologies to enable fully autonomous operation for high bandwidth data rates. Following certification, the roll on, roll off solution is truly a one-person operation.   According to Get SAT CEO Kfir Benjamin, "Get SAT's Dual SAT solution proves that there is no obstacle that can hold back any SATCOM-on-the-move application. Our miniaturized package enables true, un-blocked, constant, crisp communications. Our solution drastically cuts back on installation time and costs while easily integrating with pre-existing on-board systems." "Global Xpress has established itself as the de-facto solution for reliable, interoperable high-throughput communications across the government sector for mobile connectivity nearly anywhere. The Get SAT terminals, including the Dual SAT solution, are the lightest and most compact all-in-one 'on-the-move' solutions serving the Global Xpress network. We are proud to be part of a solution that delivers government users access to reliable, redundant, assured wideband capability on terminals that have been proven to operate in the world's harshest environmental conditions," said Steve Gizinski, Chief Technology Officer, Inmarsat Government.Global Xpress is the world's first and only, globally available, seamless mobile wideband service. In U.S. government operation since July 2014, Global Xpress has established itself as the gold standard for reliable communications across land, air and sea for assured mobile connectivity and interoperability with government satellite systems.Get SAT's micronized communications terminals are based on the company's patented fully-interlaced InterFLAT panel technology that transmits and receives signals on the same panel.
