Set to an original score by renowned northern African and Norwegian composer Malika Makouf Rasmussen, the show is a feast for the senses.Fresh from thrilling audiences the world over, it’s Canada’s turn to experience the Norwegian ensemble’s latest contemporary work. A deconstruction of the historical ritual and dance, Limbo is bodies in synch with the rhythm and colour of the African and Caribbean experience and set to the soundtrack of its spirit. A juxtaposition of light and dark, sound and silence, capture and liberation, Limbo is a journey of displacement and triumph.

The result is artistry steeped in the preservation and equity of the African diaspora shown through their patented Talawa Technique™, which pushes the boundaries of human movement. The ensemble makes each presentation an entire experience.Tabanka adds a stimulating Nordic aesthetic of the African diaspora, and dance Immersion is honoured to bring the group to Canada for three performances on February 21 and 22, 2020, at the stunning new Greenwin Theatre performance space at the Meridian Arts Centre.

Tabanka is known for its Talawa Technique™, one of the few fully codified techniques based on African and Caribbean movement practices. Working against the marginalization of black talent in the Nordic countries, Tabanka seamlessly fuses community work with high quality art production. Tabanka uses the rich aesthetics of Africa and the Caribbean in order to create vibrant contemporary work. The performance technology of deep cultural rituals is given a continuation as it claims new spaces through reverse colonization. Ancient Future is a central principle of narration in Tabanka’s art. Audience and dancers are weaved through call and response, as they imagine, forward, and back, together. Tabanka has coined this process Carib Futurism.
