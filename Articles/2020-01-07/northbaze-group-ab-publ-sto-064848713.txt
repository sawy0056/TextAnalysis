The kr50m market-cap posted a loss in its most recent financial year of -kr15.3m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of -kr26.8m leading to an even wider gap between loss and breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is NBZ’s path to profitability – when will it breakeven? I’ve put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for NBZ, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. See our latest analysis for Northbaze Group NBZ is bordering on breakeven, according to Consumer Durables analysts. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2020, before generating positive profits of kr3.0m in 2021. So, NBZ is predicted to breakeven approximately a few months from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, I calculated the rate at which NBZ must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 104% is expected, which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, NBZ may become profitable much later than analysts predict.OM:NBZ Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreUnderlying developments driving NBZ’s growth isn’t the focus of this broad overview, but, keep in mind that typically a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.One thing I’d like to point out is that NBZ has managed its capital judiciously, with debt making up 10% of equity. This means that NBZ has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital,and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Next Steps:There are too many aspects of NBZ to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – NBZ’s company page on Simply Wall St. I’ve also put together a list of relevant aspects you should further research:Valuation: What is NBZ worth today?
