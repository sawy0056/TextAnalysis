How Do You Calculate Addtech AB (publ.)'s P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Addtech AB (publ.):P/E of 25.73 = SEK303.00 ÷ SEK11.78 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each SEK1 of company earnings. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.How Does Addtech AB (publ.)'s P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. As you can see below, Addtech AB (publ.) has a higher P/E than the average company (15.5) in the trade distributors industry.OM:ADDT B Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreAddtech AB (publ.)'s P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Addtech AB (publ.) increased earnings per share by a whopping 38% last year. And earnings per share have improved by 16% annually, over the last five years. So we'd generally expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.How Does Addtech AB (publ.)'s Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Addtech AB (publ.)'s net debt is 13% of its market cap. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.The Bottom Line On Addtech AB (publ.)'s P/E RatioAddtech AB (publ.) trades on a P/E ratio of 25.7, which is above its market average of 19.3. The company is not overly constrained by its modest debt levels, and its recent EPS growth is nothing short of stand-out. So to be frank we are not surprised it has a high P/E ratio.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
