And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like ID Logistics Group (EPA:IDL). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. View our latest analysis for ID Logistics Group How Quickly Is ID Logistics Group Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years ID Logistics Group grew its EPS by 4.8% per year. While that sort of growth rate isn't amazing, it does show the business is growing.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). ID Logistics Group maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 9.1% to €1.5b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for ID Logistics Group?Are ID Logistics Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I like company leaders to have some skin in the game, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. So it is good to see that ID Logistics Group insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at €253m. Coming in at 25% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalizations between €358m and €1.4b, like ID Logistics Group, the median CEO pay is around €659k.The ID Logistics Group CEO received total compensation of just €180k in the year to December 2018. That looks like modest pay to me, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Story continuesDoes ID Logistics Group Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for ID Logistics Group is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for ID Logistics Group, but the pretty picture gets better than that. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, I'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if ID Logistics Group is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Of course, you can do well (sometimes) buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.
