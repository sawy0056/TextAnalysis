For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. Nonetheless, only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Equus Mining (ASX:EQE) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. View our latest analysis for Equus Mining When Might Equus Mining Run Out Of Money?A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. In June 2019, Equus Mining had AU$399k in cash, and was debt-free. In the last year, its cash burn was AU$2.5m. Therefore, from June 2019 it had roughly 2 months of cash runway. To be frank we are alarmed by how short that cash runway is! You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.ASX:EQE Historical Debt, January 6th 2020MoreHow Is Equus Mining's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Because Equus Mining isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. As it happens, the company's cash burn reduced by 31% over the last year, which suggests that management are mindful of the possibility of running out of cash. Admittedly, we're a bit cautious of Equus Mining due to its lack of significant operating revenues. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.How Easily Can Equus Mining Raise Cash?While Equus Mining is showing a solid reduction in its cash burn, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash to fund growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.Equus Mining's cash burn of AU$2.5m is about 15% of its AU$17m market capitalisation. As a result, we'd venture that the company could raise more cash for growth without much trouble, albeit at the cost of some dilution.So, Should We Worry About Equus Mining's Cash Burn?Even though its cash runway makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought Equus Mining's cash burn reduction was relatively promising. After looking at that range of measures, we think shareholders should be extremely attentive to how the company is using its cash, as the cash burn makes us uncomfortable. While we always like to monitor cash burn for early stage companies, qualitative factors such as the CEO pay can also shed light on the situation.
