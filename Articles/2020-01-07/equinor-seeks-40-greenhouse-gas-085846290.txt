In 2050 there can't be any oil extraction from Norway's continental shelf," tweeted Andreas Radoey, a board member at NGO Nature and Youth.($1 = 8.8451 Norwegian crowns)(Reporting by Terje Solsvik; editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Jason Neely)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextEOG Resources (EOG) Q4 Earnings Top EstimatesZacksChinese scientist sentenced to prison in US for technology theftAFPOccidental posts quarterly loss on impairment, chargesReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
