Notably, contamination-free transportation, storage and delivery of materials have gained immense significance in recent times.Industry participants are benefiting from the ongoing transition in semiconductor manufacturing technology. The demand for advanced packaging that enables the miniaturization of electronic products remains strong. Consistent shift to smaller dimensions, rapid adoption of new device architectures like FinFET transistors and 3D-NAND along with increasing utilization of new manufacturing materials to increase transistor and bit density are driving demand for solutions provided by the industry players. Moreover, emergence of techniques like wafer level packaging (WLP) is anticipated to raise the need for a high-purity manufacturing environment, free of contaminants. The rising demand for clean processing as well as wafer carrier cleaning and conditioning tools is a key catalyst for the industry participants. The requirement of faster, more powerful and more energy efficient semiconductors is expected to increase rapidly on robust adoption of cloud computing, IoT and AI. Semiconductor manufacturers like Intel (INTC), Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors are primarily looking to maximize manufacturing yields at lower costs. This is actually making semiconductor manufacturing processes more complex and in turn driving demand for solutions offered by the industry participants. The rapid adoption of IoT-supported factory automation solutions is also a contributing factor. Further, increasing demand for 5G infrastructure is a key catalyst. Improving demand for particularly NAND and DRAM is a positive for the industry participants. Moreover, strong SSD demand and rising NAND pricing are key catalysts. DRAM is expected to benefit from strong demand in the data center, enterprise and cloud segments. Additionally, anticipated recovery in new equipment spending is a major positive.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Electronics - Manufacturing Machinery industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.
