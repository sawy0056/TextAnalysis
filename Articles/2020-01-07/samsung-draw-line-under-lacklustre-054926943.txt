"Both solid demand forecast from the server/hyperscale (infrastructure) customers and optimism around 5G smartphone adoption are the drivers for growth."Reflecting that mood, analysts polled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate expect Samsung's annual profit to surge nearly 40% in 2020. The company itself doesn't typically issue full-year earnings estimates.Despite 2019's tough times for the world of chips, Samsung still generated half of its January-September profit from the business. That core strength, along with optimism for 2020, helped Samsung's shares ride out weak earnings to end last year with a 44% gain, compared with an 8% rise for the Seoul benchmark index.Still, many industry experts remain cautious about the strength of recovery this year."The chip market will rebound in 2020 from a low base last year, but it is premature to expect a boom (like that) seen in 2017," said Park Jun-hong, a director at S&P Global Ratings.Samsung, also the world's leading maker of mobile phones, TVs and displays, itself echoes that caution. It flagged last week what it said would be a more difficult global economy this year, hurt by rising political uncertainty and a possible slump in consumption.($1 = 1,164.8600 won)(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Additional reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Kenneth Maxwell)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextVerizon Hits 4.2 Gbps Network Speed With Carrier AggregationZacksRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
