At the same time, women spoke out and continued to make inroads into politics and other traditionally male preserves.And while this may be unsettling for some men, it is a good thing, notes Destin Gerek, an internationally recognized expert on masculinity, male sexuality and male empowerment. As he points out in his new book, The Evolved Masculine: Be The Man The World Needs & The One She Craves (Archetypal Publishing), "We are living in a time in which notions of masculinity and femininity and the roles of men and women are being questioned and have become more fluid than ever before. … Increasingly powerful women have necessitated men to rethink their own role: These radical changes have become increasingly uncomfortable for us as men. They have forced us to look within, reassess our own outdated programming, and evolve our understanding of masculinity and what it means to be a man."Gerek's book aims to fill that void even as it chronicles his own transformative search for the answers to what is masculinity, what is the beauty and good in it, and what qualities and values it adds to men's lives.Gerek has been featured in Entrepreneur, Details, the Associated Press, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and on Showtime and Playboy Radio, among others.In an interview, he can discuss:What does it mean to be a good man in 2020? Why does he say that recreating the world to allow for women and the feminine to flourish doesn't need to be at the expense of men? How can men cope with the confusing and conflicting messages that surround them? What did he learn from creating his Erotic Rockstar avatar than led him to a seemingly endless stream of lovers in over two dozen countries? How can men unleash their sexuality without becoming "one of those guys" women despise? What are some of the concepts he promotes that challenge what we have been taught to believe?Praise for The Evolved Masculine"Destin Gerek is THE most informed and skillful educator of conscious masculinity today. During a daunting era for the modern man, he fearlessly leads them out of confusion and into clarity, power, and purpose. His wisdom is the guidance every man should have if he wants to play a bigger game." – Eva Clay, LCSW, clinical sexologist and founder of the Institute of Intimacy Arts"This book takes real risks. Destin plumbs the depths of his own story (and psyche) to offer a path to any person ready for reinvention. … The Evolved Masculine turns the idea of authenticity on its head, and arrives, surprisingly, at a place of vulnerable and authentic being for men." – Boysen Hodgson communications director, ManKind Project USA"I could hardly put it down. … I feel greater understanding and compassion for men as a result of reading The Evolved Masculine."– KC Baker, founder, WomanSpeak, Inc.About the AuthorDestin Gerek is a globally recognized leading voice in masculinity, sexuality, and personal empowerment. He is founder and CEO of The Evolved Masculine, a pioneering coaching and training company for men and an international speaker and hosts a podcast by the same name.Contact: Destin Gerek, (415) 341-2650; 231821@email4pr.com; destin@evolvedmasculine.com; EvolvedMasculine.com;  http://FB.com/DestinGerekProfile; Instagram: @EvolvedMasculine; Twitter: @DestinGerekCisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-book-explores-what-being-a-man-means-in-2020-300981158.htmlSOURCE Destin GerekReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
