(NASDAQ: SRAX), a digital marketing and consumer data management technology company, offers a California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) compliant data set. CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020, and according to major news sources most companies are not yet compliant or prepared for the impact CCPA will have.SRAX (PRNewsfoto/SRAX)MoreThe use of third-party data is threatened by the CCPA as it will greatly affect what data can be used for targeting purposes. This means first-party data still reigns supreme and for brands, managing customer relationships is more important now than ever before.SRAX's BIGtoken is a platform that enables people to own and earn from their data. With more than 16 million users worldwide, BIGtoken is a CCPA compliant data set, which is very valuable when third-party data sets are in question.
