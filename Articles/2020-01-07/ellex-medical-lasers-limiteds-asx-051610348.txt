The AU$114m market-cap company announced a latest loss of -AU$5.8m on 30 June 2019 for its most recent financial year result. The most pressing concern for investors is ELX’s path to profitability – when will it breakeven? I’ve put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for ELX, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. Check out our latest analysis for Ellex Medical Lasers Consensus from the 2 Medical Equipment analysts is ELX is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2021, before turning a profit of AU$2.9m in 2022. So, ELX is predicted to breakeven approximately 2 years from now. What rate will ELX have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, I calculated an average annual growth rate of 77%, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.ASX:ELX Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreGiven this is a high-level overview, I won’t go into details of ELX’s upcoming projects, however, take into account that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.One thing I’d like to point out is that ELX has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 22% of equity. This means that ELX has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital,and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Next Steps:This article is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis on ELX, so if you are interested in understanding the company at a deeper level, take a look at ELX’s company page on Simply Wall St. I’ve also put together a list of pertinent factors you should look at:Historical Track Record: What has ELX's performance been like over the past?
