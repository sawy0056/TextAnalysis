It is not only the highest quality metal, but its density makes it one of the most durable and enduring precious metals. Platinum is also naturally white, unlike white gold, which means it will not cast any tint onto a diamond or gemstone, allowing the stone's genuine color to sparkle brightly.For more information, please visit Platinum Guild International USA's sites:Consumer website: www.platinumjewelry.com Facebook page: www.facebook.com/jewelryplatinumInstagram page: https://www.instagram.com/platinum_jewelry/Hashtag: #BePlatinum CisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-77th-annual-golden-globe-awards-sets-the-stage-for-timeless-platinum-jewelry-300981369.htmlSOURCE Platinum Guild International USAReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
