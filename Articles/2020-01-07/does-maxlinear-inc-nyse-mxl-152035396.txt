(NYSE:MXL) Share Price Tend To Follow The Market?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosAnyone researching MaxLinear, Inc. (NYSE:MXL) might want to consider the historical volatility of the share price. Modern finance theory considers volatility to be a measure of risk, and there are two main types of price volatility. First, we have company specific volatility, which is the price gyrations of an individual stock. Holding at least 8 stocks can reduce this kind of risk across a portfolio. The second type is the broader market volatility, which you cannot diversify away, since it arises from macroeconomic factors which directly affects all the stocks on the market.Some stocks mimic the volatility of the market quite closely, while others demonstrate muted, exagerrated or uncorrelated price movements. Some investors use beta as a measure of how much a certain stock is impacted by market risk (volatility). While we should keep in mind that Warren Buffett has cautioned that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk', beta is still a useful factor to consider. To make good use of it you must first know that the beta of the overall market is one. A stock with a beta greater than one is more sensitive to broader market movements than a stock with a beta of less than one. See our latest analysis for MaxLinear What does MXL's beta value mean to investors?Given that it has a beta of 1.23, we can surmise that the MaxLinear share price has been fairly sensitive to market volatility (over the last 5 years). If the past is any guide, we would expect that MaxLinear shares will rise quicker than the markets in times of optimism, but fall faster in times of pessimism. Many would argue that beta is useful in position sizing, but fundamental metrics such as revenue and earnings are more important overall.
