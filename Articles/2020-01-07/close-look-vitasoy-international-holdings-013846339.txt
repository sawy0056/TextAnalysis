All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Vitasoy International Holdings:0.26 = HK$969m ÷ (HK$6.1b - HK$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, Vitasoy International Holdings has an ROCE of 26%.
