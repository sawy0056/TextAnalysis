The growth of this market is largely driven by the rising geriatric population, high risk of injuries to caregivers during the manual handling of patients, and the implementation of regulations ensuring the safety of healthcare personnel during manual lifting processes. On the other hand, the persistent difficulties in handling bariatric patients are expected to limit market growth to a certain extent.Markets and Markets LogoMoreDownload PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=186358368The wheelchairs & mobility scooters segment is expected to account for the largest share of the mobility devices market in 2019Based on type, the mobility devices market is segmented into wheelchairs & mobility scooters and ambulatory aids.
