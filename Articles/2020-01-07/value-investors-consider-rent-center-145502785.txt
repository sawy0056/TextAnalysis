After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Rent-A-Center, Inc. RCII stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Rent-A-Center has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.28, as you can see in the chart below:View photosThis level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.19. However, if we focus on the long-term PE trend, Rent-A-Center’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 12.08 over the past five years.View photosThe stock’s PE however compares favorably with the Consumer Discretionary Market’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.41. This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now, compared to its peers.View photosStory continuesMeanwhile Rent-A-Center has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 10.88, which is lower than the current level. So, so it is fair to say that a more value-oriented path is ahead of the stock in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Rent-A-Center has a P/S ratio of just 0.6. This is quite lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.49x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.View photosBroad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Rent-A-Center currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Rent-A-Center a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Rent-A-Center might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A. This gives RCII a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>).Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. While the current-quarter estimate has seen two upward and no downward movements, the current-year estimate has also seen one upward and one downward movement over the past two months.This has had a mixed effect on the consensus estimate. While the current-quarter consensus has increased 1.8% over the past two months, the current-year estimate has remained stable. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Rent-A-Center, Inc. Price and ConsensusView photosRent-A-Center, Inc.

QuoteSuch mixed analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineRent-A-Center is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite a strong industry rank (among Top 7% of more than 250 industries), with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about the stock.Also, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:View photosSo, value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank, past industry performance and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
