Institutions would also be allowed to offer other cryptocurrency services such as trading.“The Korean government has to gradually allow institutional investors to deal in crypto assets and promote over-the-counter (OTC) desks dedicated to institutional investors’ trade,” the committee said in the report.To support such a move, the nation’s fintech sector should develop custody solutions for cryptocurrency to avoid a reliance on foreign custodians, said the PCFIR.Addressing crypto exchanges, the committee said the government should look into bringing in a licensing scheme or guidance. The industry is currently loosely controlled via guidance given to banks and a South Korean financial watchdog under the Financial Services Commission is also reportedly aiming to directly supervise exchanges.Related: Closer Look at SEC ‘Accredited Investor’ Revamp Suggests Little Will ChangeOther suggestions from the PCFIR included, notably, that bitcoin might be directly listed on Korea Exchange, the nation’s securities bourse, and that the terms “cryptocurrency” and “virtual currency” could be brought together under the umbrella term crypto assets.The PCFIR was set up in 2017 to advise on policies relating to new technologies and help lay the groundwork for related new industries and services.Related StoriesKorea’s Tax Agency to Withhold $70M From Crypto Exchange BithumbSouth Korean Central Bank to Organize a CBDC Task ForceReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergBTS cancel concerts as South Korea coronavirus cases pass 2,000AFPHyundai suspends output at one factory after worker tests positive for coronavirus - sourceReutersThe 6 largest coronavirus outbreaks outside of ChinaCBS NewsBTS cancels concerts in South Korean capital due to virusAssociated PressBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
