Harrington, provides a thoroughly researched account of the 45th President's first two years in the White House and his questionable dealings over four decades preceding his election.WASHINGTON, Jan. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Retired national security analyst Dr. Michael B. Harrington has published a comprehensive examination of President Donald J. Trump's public life – from his mob connections in the early 1980s through his first two stumbling years in the White House. In "The Forty Year Con Game" Dr. Harrington documents Trump's consistent history of ignorance, self-absorption, poor judgment, corruption, impulsive decision-making, bigotry, and strong authoritarian instincts. Taken together, Dr. Harrington writes, these character flaws guaranteed a disastrous presidency.During the 2016 election, many voters were largely unaware that their soon-to-be president's claims of success were a veneer cloaking his incompetence and failure as a businessman. As the 2020 election approaches, President Trump faces increasing skepticism among Americans – even those who originally entrusted him with their vote – that he is fit for high office."Having witnessed Trump's skill at defrauding others over four decades, I was appalled by his election to the highest office in our country," Dr. Harrington said. "Democracy is fragile, not self-perpetuating. It requires tending for it to flourish. Incompetent, self-serving, and corrupt leadership poses an existential threat to its survival."Dr. Harrington's book serves as a cautionary tale. "The Forty Year Con Game" reminds readers that political con artists are common both in the U.S. and around the world and argues that Trump's forty-year con game may be the nearest, most dangerous threat to democracy the country has faced since the Civil War."Dr. Harrington has had the courage to provide a well-researched, factual, informative book about the character of our current leader," a reader wrote in a five-star Amazon review of the book. "It's a real eye-opener that sheds light on a national crisis.""The Forty Year Con Game: Everything You Need to Know About Donald Trump's Threat to Democracy" By Dr. Michael B.
