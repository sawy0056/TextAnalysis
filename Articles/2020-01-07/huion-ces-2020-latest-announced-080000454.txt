However, for professional creative workers especially interior designers, graphics tablets with a much larger panel size may do the work better and bring them more flexibility; in which case, Kamvas Pro 24 is well worth the consideration. Kamvas Pro 24, equipped with a QHD screen and 2.5K display resolution, is so far the product with the highest display resolution manufactured by Huion. Additionally, 10 press keys located on both sides of the panel can be programmed separately to realize 20 different functions. Touch bars allocated symmetrically on each side of the device are specially designed to meet the requests of both left-handed and right-handed users, which is the embodiment of Huion's mantra, to Bear User Request in Mind, Encourage User Involvement and Fulfill Targets with User-oriented Thoughts. View photosKamvas Pro 24MoreTo unleash and share your creativity as well as learn more details about Huion products, please visit www.huion.com.For media enquiries: Carlos Lin+86-18820178551CisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/huion-at-ces-2020-latest-announced-graphics-tablets-are-ready-to-inspire-creatives-300980804.htmlSOURCE Shenzhen Huion Animation TechnologyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
