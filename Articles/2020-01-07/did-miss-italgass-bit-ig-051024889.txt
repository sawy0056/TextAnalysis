But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, Italgas S.p.A. (BIT:IG) shareholders have seen the share price rise 45% over three years, well in excess of the market return (4.9%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 12% in the last year , including dividends . See our latest analysis for Italgas While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the three years of share price growth, Italgas actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 28% per year.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.Interestingly, the dividend has increased over time; so that may have given the share price a boost. Sometimes yield-chasing investors will flock to a company if they think the dividend can grow over time. On top of that, revenue grew at a rate of 37% per year, and it's likely investors interpret that as pointing to a brighter future.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).BIT:IG Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreItalgas is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Italgas the TSR over the last 3 years was 65%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveOver the last year Italgas shareholders have received a TSR of 12%. It's always nice to make money but this return falls short of the market return which was about 25% for the year. But the (superior) three-year TSR of 18% per year is some consolation. We prefer focus on longer term returns, as they are usually a more meaningful indication of the underlying business. Importantly, we haven't analysed Italgas's dividend history.
