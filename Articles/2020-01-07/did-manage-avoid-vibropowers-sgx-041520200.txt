We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. Spare a thought for those who held VibroPower Corporation Limited (SGX:BJD) for five whole years - as the share price tanked 79%. View our latest analysis for VibroPower While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, VibroPower moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.It could be that the revenue decline of 14% per year is viewed as evidence that VibroPower is shrinking. That could explain the weak share price.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).SGX:BJD Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at VibroPower's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered VibroPower's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Its history of dividend payouts mean that VibroPower's TSR, which was a 78% drop over the last 5 years, was not as bad as the share price return.A Different PerspectiveVibroPower provided a TSR of 8.8% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 26% endured over half a decade. It could well be that the business is stabilizing. Is VibroPower cheap compared to other companies?
