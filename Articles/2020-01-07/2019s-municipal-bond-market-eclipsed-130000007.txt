The municipal bond market also made out well, hitting over the $400 billion mark.“The municipal bond market eclipsed the $400 billion mark for the fourth time since 2010, thanks to taxable trend that led to a vault in fourth quarter volume,” a Bond Buyer report noted. “Municipal issuance picked up the pace in December to the tune of $40.79 billion, with taxable bonds accounting for about a quarter of the month’s supply. For the year, volume jumped 21.8% to $421.69 billion from $346.06 billion in 2018.”Not only has it been a strong December, but also a strong decade for municipal debt—marked by stability, which has made them a prime alternative when considering safe haven assets.“Muni credit has become increasingly stable as the decade progressed,” wrote John Hallacy in Bond Buyer. “Going back to the days of recalibration of ratings, the rating spectrum outstanding has contracted along with spreads. There are many more Aa/AA category ratings than ever before. Analysts use fine gradations to differentiate credits but at times those efforts are lost on the market.”“The credits that depart from the norms become very well known in a relatively short period of time,” Hallacy added. “Resolution of these cases can take considerable time, expense and effort. We should be further along to closure on some of the issues revolving around Puerto Rico. There is still ample time for testing legal concepts within the proceedings. All parties have a different perspective on what constitutes fair settlements. We can only hope that resolution comes well before the end of the next decade.”Three municipal bond funds to consider:Xtrackers Municipal Infrastructure Revenue Bond ETF (RVNU B-): seeks investment results that correspond generally to the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive Municipal Infrastructure Revenue Bond Index. The fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets (but typically far more) in instruments that comprise the underlying index. The underlying index is comprised of tax-exempt municipal securities issued by states, cities, counties, districts, their respective agencies, and other tax-exempt issuers. Franklin Liberty Municipal Bond ETF (FLMB): seeks a high level of current income that is exempt from federal income taxes. Although the fund tries to invest all of its assets in tax-free securities, it is possible that up to 20% of the fund’s net assets may be in securities that pay interest that may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and, although not anticipated, in securities that pay interest subject to other federal or state income taxes. VanEck Vectors AMT-Free Long Municipal Index ETF (MLN A-): seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Bloomberg Barclays AMT-Free Long Continuous Municipal Index. The index is comprised of publicly traded municipal bonds that cover the U.S. dollar-denominated long-term tax-exempt bond market.This article originally appeared on ETFTrends.com.Click here to read the original article on ETFdb.com.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Wells Fargo Advantage Funds to Add to Your PortfolioZacksJunk-bond issuance stops ‘dead in its tracks’ on coronavirus fearsMarketWatchIs VFSTX a Strong Bond Fund Right Now?ZacksNew York's Subway System to Raise $1 Billion in New DebtBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
