Coal pollution has been linked to premature deaths, asthma, heart and lung ailments, cancer, neurological problems, acid rain, global warming and climate change, and other severe impacts.  In the US, a staggering 65% of carbon emissions are produced by coal plants.  US Nuclear’s goal is to slowly replace all coal-fired plants with green, electric fusion generators that are fueled by renewable heavy water from the ocean rather than fossil or nuclear fuels.  US Nuclear will manufacturer the electric generators, which are being developed by their strategic partner, who has already achieved historic milestones towards building a commercial fusion generator powerful enough to economically produce electricity for our power grids. The purpose of these electric generators is to produce safe, clean, low-cost energy, and be scalable and compact compared to all other energy production footprints.Safe Harbor ActThis press release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
