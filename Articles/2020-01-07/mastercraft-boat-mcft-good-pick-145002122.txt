After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. MCFT stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, MasterCraft Boat has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5.59, as you can see in the chart below:View photosThis level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.19. Also, if we focus on the long-term PE trend, MasterCraft Boat’s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 14.65 over the past five years.View photosThe stock’s PE however compares favorably with the Consumer Discretionary Market’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.41. This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now, compared to its peers.View photosStory continuesMeanwhile MasterCraft Boat has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 5.93, which is slightly higher than the current level. So, so it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, MasterCraft Boat has a P/S ratio of just 0.59. This is quite lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.49x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.View photosBroad Value OutlookIn aggregate, MasterCraft Boat currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes MasterCraft Boat a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though MasterCraft Boat might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of B. This gives MCFT a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>).Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. While the current-quarter estimate has seen no upward and two downward movements, the current-year estimate has also seen one upward and no downward movements over the past two months.This has had a mixed effect on the consensus estimate. While the current-quarter consensus has dropped 20.5% over the past two months, the current-year estimate has climbed 0.8%.

QuoteDespite such mixed analyst sentiments, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and it is the reason why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineMasterCraft Boat is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Besides a strong industry rank (among Top 9% of more than 250 industries), a Zacks Rank #2 instils investors’ optimism the stock.However, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:View photosWe believe, despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance and mixed analyst sentiments, a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in MasterCraft Boat.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
