This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Viva Energy Group Limited (ASX:VEA), by way of a worked example.Over the last twelve months Viva Energy Group has recorded a ROE of 18%. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each A$1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made A$0.18 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Viva Energy Group How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Viva Energy Group:18% = AU$505m ÷ AU$2.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does ROE Signify?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, all else being equal, a high ROE is better than a low one. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Viva Energy Group Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Viva Energy Group has a higher ROE than the average (15%) in the Oil and Gas industry.ASX:VEA Past Revenue and Net Income, January 6th 2020MoreThat's clearly a positive. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. One data point to check is if insiders have bought shares recently.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining Viva Energy Group's Debt And Its 18% Return On EquityAlthough Viva Energy Group does use a little debt, its debt to equity ratio of just 0.09 is very low. Its very respectable ROE, combined with only modest debt, suggests the business is in good shape. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Story continuesIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss thisfree list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
