And unfortunately for Marker Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRKR) shareholders, the stock is a lot lower today than it was a year ago. The share price has slid 58% in that time. To make matters worse, the returns over three years have also been really disappointing (the share price is 39% lower than three years ago). Furthermore, it's down 41% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. View our latest analysis for Marker Therapeutics Marker Therapeutics hasn't yet reported any revenue, so it's as much a business idea as an actual business. You have to wonder why venture capitalists aren't funding it. So it seems that the investors focused more on what could be, than paying attention to the current revenues (or lack thereof). For example, they may be hoping that Marker Therapeutics comes up with a great new product, before it runs out of money.As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some such companies do very well over the long term, others become hyped up by promoters before eventually falling back down to earth, and going bankrupt (or being recapitalized). Marker Therapeutics has already given some investors a taste of the bitter losses that high risk investing can cause.When it last reported its balance sheet in September 2019, Marker Therapeutics had cash in excess of all liabilities of US$45m. While that's nothing to panic about, there is some possibility the company will raise more capital, especially if profits are not imminent. With the share price down 58% in the last year , it seems likely that the need for cash is weighing on investors' minds.

However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period.
