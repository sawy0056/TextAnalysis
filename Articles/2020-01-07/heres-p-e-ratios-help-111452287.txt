We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to NGS Group AB (publ)'s (STO:NGS), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is NGS Group's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 9.58. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying SEK9.58 for every SEK1 in prior year profit. View our latest analysis for NGS Group How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for NGS Group:P/E of 9.58 = SEK20.10 ÷ SEK2.10 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each SEK1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does NGS Group Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. The image below shows that NGS Group has a lower P/E than the average (18.9) P/E for companies in the healthcare industry.OM:NGS Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreNGS Group's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with NGS Group, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.NGS Group saw earnings per share decrease by 51% last year. And EPS is down 8.2% a year, over the last 5 years. This might lead to muted expectations.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does NGS Group's Balance Sheet Tell Us?NGS Group's net debt is 17% of its market cap. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.The Verdict On NGS Group's P/E RatioNGS Group trades on a P/E ratio of 9.6, which is below the SE market average of 19.3. Since it only carries a modest debt load, it's likely the low expectations implied by the P/E ratio arise from the lack of recent earnings growth.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. Although we don't have analyst forecasts you might want to assess this data-rich visualization of earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesOf course you might be able to find a better stock than NGS Group.
