But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like JNBY Design (HKG:3306). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. See our latest analysis for JNBY Design How Fast Is JNBY Design Growing?As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years JNBY Design grew its EPS by 15% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note JNBY Design's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 17% to CN¥3.4b. That's progress.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So we're pleased to report that JNBY Design insiders own a meaningful share of the business. Indeed, with a collective holding of 64%, company insiders are in control and have plenty of capital behind the venture. This makes me think they will be incentivised to plan for the long term - something I like to see. And their holding is extremely valuable at the current share price, totalling CN¥3.3b. That means they have plenty of their own capital riding on the performance of the business!It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. For companies with market capitalizations between CN¥2.8b and CN¥11b, like JNBY Design, the median CEO pay is around CN¥3.3m.JNBY Design offered total compensation worth CN¥2.0m to its CEO in the year to June 2019. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. While the level of CEO compensation isn't a huge factor in my view of the company, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Should You Add JNBY Design To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of JNBY Design is that it is growing profits. Earnings growth might be the main game for JNBY Design, but the fun does not stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, I'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. Now, you could try to make up your mind on JNBY Design by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.Story continuesYou can invest in any company you want.
