But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term Investors Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISBC) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 16% in three years, versus a market return of about 49%. Check out our latest analysis for Investors Bancorp While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Although the share price is down over three years, Investors Bancorp actually managed to grow EPS by 3.7% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's pretty reasonable to suspect the market was previously to bullish on the stock, and has since moderated expectations. Looking to other metrics might better explain the share price change.The company has kept revenue pretty healthy over the last three years, so we doubt that explains the falling share price. We're not entirely sure why the share price is dropped, but it does seem likely investors have become less optimistic about the business.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).NasdaqGS:ISBC Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreWe know that Investors Bancorp has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Investors Bancorp stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Investors Bancorp's TSR for the last 3 years was -7.5%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveInvestors Bancorp shareholders are up 12% for the year (even including dividends) . But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 4.8% per year over five year. It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals.
