But along the way some stocks are going to perform badly. For example the GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. (NASDAQ:GNMK) share price dropped 64% over five years. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 17% in thirty days. Check out our latest analysis for GenMark Diagnostics GenMark Diagnostics isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.Over five years, GenMark Diagnostics grew its revenue at 19% per year. That's well above most other pre-profit companies. In contrast, the share price is has averaged a loss of 18% per year - that's quite disappointing. It's safe to say investor expectations are more grounded now.
