As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on SOHO China’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for SOHO China Is SOHO China still cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my relative valuation model. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that SOHO China’s ratio of 9.76x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 6.95x, which means if you buy SOHO China today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that SOHO China should be trading at this level in the long run, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because SOHO China’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will SOHO China generate?SEHK:410 Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations.

It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? 410 seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio.
