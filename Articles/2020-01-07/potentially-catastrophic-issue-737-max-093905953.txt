The safety review was first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by Boeing officials.It grew out of an FAA request to Boeing for an internal audit to confirm the company had accurately assessed the dangers of key systems in light of new assumptions about pilot response times to emergency situations.  Boeing is reviewing whether two bundles of "critical wiring" are too close together and could cause a short circuit.  If a short goes unnoticed by pilots who then do nothing to respond to the situation, it could put the plane in a catastrophic nose dive. But multiple sources tell CBS News Transportation Correspondent Kris Van Cleave that is a hypothetical at best, since Boeing hasn't determined whether that scenario could actually occur in flight.  If necessary, Boeing would have to separate or better insulate those bundles on the  to service.Americans who know of 737 Max troubles say they don't want to fly on plane FAA finds new potential risk in Boeing 737 Max planesThe engine supplier for the 737 Max, CFM International, has also alerted the FAA to a potential weakness with one of the engine's rotors that has a remote possibility of a failure. The agency may require additional engine inspections. CFM is a joint venture between General Electric and the French aerospace company Safran.Boeing is also looking at a manufacturing issue with some engine covers that involves possible damage to a coating that insulates the engine cowlings from lighting strikes. Meanwhile, the FAA confirms it's still reviewing the findings from a round of simulator testing by a cross section of 737 pilots from American, Southwest, United and Aeromexico airlines. They successfully landed the plane and responded to scenarios presented but about half didn't use the prescribed emergency procedures to handle the problems. The next round of FAA flight testing is expected later this month. Those findings could push the FAA to recommend additional simulator training but it's premature to speculate on that.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBoeing airplanes boss earns big stock award after strong launch of new divisionAmerican City Business JournalsP&G veteran tapped for C-suite at BoeingAmerican City Business JournalsGovernment leaders talk layoff response and building Wichita’s future to Emerging LeadersAmerican City Business JournalsSkift Forum Europe Preview: Why Ryanair Still Doesn’t Need to Be LovedSkiftBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
