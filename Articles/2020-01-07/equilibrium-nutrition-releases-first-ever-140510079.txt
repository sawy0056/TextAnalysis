Although there are no extraneous ingredients, there are a number of exclusive nutrients that make these synergies very unique.Capsimax® is a trademarked form of cayenne pepper with clinical research showing its ability to boost thermogenesis and thus burn more calories even while at rest.InnoSlim® is the trademarked combined formula of blending Panax Ginseng with Astragalus root to effectively boost metabolic rate and burn more body fat.GS4® is a trademarked form of the Ayurvedic herb, Gymnema Sylverstre leaf extract. It works by balancing healthy levels of blood sugar, which in turn can help tap into more body fat as a fuel source throughout the day.HTPurity™ is the trademarked source of 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is a naturally occurring precursor to the neurotransmitter, Serotonin. Why this is important is because serotonin helps in appetite suppression, mood boosting, and deeper levels of sleep.Bioperine® is the trademarked source of black pepper fruit extract that better enables the body to digest and absorb nutrients in herbal and nutritional supplement formulas such as the Fatlossity™ DAY & NIGHT.A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/11c2f0fa-8708-44fb-ad80-a0c2213dfb83ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTake This Vitamin for Better WorkoutsSTACKBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
