This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. View our latest analysis for National Express Group How Does Dean Finch's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, National Express Group PLC has a market capitalization of UK£2.4b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth UK£4.2m over the year to December 2018. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at UK£630k. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. When we examined a selection of companies with market caps ranging from UK£1.5b to UK£4.9b, we found the median CEO total compensation was UK£1.7m.Thus we can conclude that Dean Finch receives more in total compensation than the median of a group of companies in the same market, and of similar size to National Express Group PLC.
