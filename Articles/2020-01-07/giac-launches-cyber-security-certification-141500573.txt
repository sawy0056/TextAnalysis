Today, we're starting to realize and respect that. The GIAC Enterprise Vulnerability Assessor (GEVA) certification represents an opportunity to master these critical abilities. GEVA-certified vulnerability assessors have the skills to dive deep into application-specific vulnerability analysis, to root out false-positive findings, to calculate true risk based on impact, and to maximize effects through triage."Certified GEVA practitioners are capable of handling threat management, comprehensively assessing vulnerabilities, and producing a vigorous defensive strategy. Professionals holding the GEVA certification have validated technical vulnerability assessment skills and experience with time-tested practical approaches to ensure security across the enterprise.GEVA is designed to validate skills taught in the SANS Institute course, SEC460: Enterprise Threat and Vulnerability Assessment. The GEVA certification is now available to the public, and registration is open online.
