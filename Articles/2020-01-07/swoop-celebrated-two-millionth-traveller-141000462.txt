To commemorate this milestone achievement, Swoop presented an unsuspecting guest with a round-trip flight to anywhere Swoop flies. The lucky traveller, Travis Pickering, was surprised by Swoop on-board a flight from Edmonton International Airport (EIA) to McCarran International Airport with his wife and two children."Reaching this milestone of having flown two million travellers in this short timeframe affirms the need for Canadians to have affordable air travel options," said Shane Workman, Head of Flight Operations, Swoop. "Swoop is humbled for the opportunity to be part of so many Canadians' travel plans. Whether they were travelling to visit family, take a vacation or for business, we are honoured that Swoop has been the airline of choice for two million travellers."Since its launch, Swoop's network has grown to serve 14 domestic, 10 transborder and four international markets, rapidly expanding the airline's network across North America.

"In 2019, we celebrated serving 50 million passengers for the first time in a single year thanks in part to Swoop passengers.  We are honored to return the favor by helping to welcome its 2 millionth passenger.""Swoop has been a welcome addition to the Las Vegas market and we are proud to celebrate this milestone with them," said H. Fletch Brunelle, vice president of marketing for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.
