But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the INFICON Holding AG (VTX:IFCN) share price has soared 140% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 18% over the last quarter. See our latest analysis for INFICON Holding While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, INFICON Holding managed to grow its earnings per share at 8.3% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).SWX:IFCN Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreDive deeper into INFICON Holding's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of INFICON Holding's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for INFICON Holding the TSR over the last 5 years was 190%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that INFICON Holding shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 64% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 24% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
