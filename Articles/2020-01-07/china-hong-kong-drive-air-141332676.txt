The two locations taken together for the months of October and November increased their outgoing volumes by 4.6% compared with the year 2017 and by 5.1% compared with 2018."Main engines behind this growth are the destinations Europe and the Middle East and South Asia (MESA), but exports to North America decreased," said the analyst.High-tech was the fastest growing export product category in China and Hong Kong. "The origin Asia- Pacific as a whole, whilst more than 5% down for the year 2019, did not show a year-over-year decrease in November," noted the analyst."All other origin regions except one, also showed a better year-over-year performance in November than in the 10 months before. That one exception was Europe; -5.1% year-over-year for the year up till now, but -5.5% for November."Worldwide chargeable weight was down by 6.9% year-over-year in August, by 5.3% in September, by 4.7% in October, but by only 2.5% in November."Does this mean we are going to end the year on a – relatively – high note?" asked WorldACD."If the trend continues, the month of December may be the first month in 2019 showing no year-over-year decline. But even if December year-over-year would turn out to be ‘neutral,' the worldwide volume for the full year 2019 will be -4.3% compared to 2018.
