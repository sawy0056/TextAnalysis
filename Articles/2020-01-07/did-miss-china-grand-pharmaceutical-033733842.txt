But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings Limited (HKG:512) share price has flown 199% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 10% over the last quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 10% in the last three months. Check out our latest analysis for China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings was able to grow its EPS at 43% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. Notably, the 44% average annual share price gain matches up nicely with the EPS growth rate. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SEHK:512 Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings's TSR for the last 3 years was 206%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 35% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 24% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
