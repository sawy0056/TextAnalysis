Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Want Want China Holdings! SEHK:151 Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, Want Want China Holdings paid out 69% of its profit as dividends. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Want Want China Holdings paid out a conservative 41% of its free cash flow as dividends last year. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.With a strong net cash balance, Want Want China Holdings investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Want Want China Holdings's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Want Want China Holdings has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was CN¥0.13 in 2010, compared to CN¥0.25 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.3% a year over that time. Want Want China Holdings's dividend payments have fluctuated, so it hasn't grown 6.3% every year, but the CAGR is a useful rule of thumb for approximating the historical growth.It's good to see the dividend growing at a decent rate, but the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Want Want China Holdings might have put its house in order since then, but we remain cautious.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? While there may be fluctuations in the past , Want Want China Holdings's earnings per share have basically not grown from where they were five years ago. Over the long term, steady earnings per share is a risk as the value of the dividends can be reduced by inflation.Story continuesConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Want Want China Holdings's payout ratios are within a normal range for the average corporation, and we like that its cashflow was stronger than reported profits. Earnings per share are down, and Want Want China Holdings's dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. While we're not hugely bearish on it, overall we think there are potentially better dividend stocks than Want Want China Holdings out there.Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from costs or inflation. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company.We have also put together a list of global stocks with a market capitalisation above $1bn and yielding more 3%.
