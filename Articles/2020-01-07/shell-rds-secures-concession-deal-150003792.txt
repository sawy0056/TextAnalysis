In its first ever round of licensing in the Red Sea, Egypt awarded Block 1 and Block 2 to Chevron and Shell, respectively. The third block was jointly conferred on Shell and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Petroleum.Egypt was auctioning 10 blocks in its first ever licensing round in the Red Sea, which is known for its deep water. Winners of only three of the 10 blocks were declared, of which Chevron and Shell’s blocks were located in the northern part of the Red Sea.While total exploration area of these three blocks exceeded 10,000 square kilometres, the minimum stipulated investment was $326 million wherein the potential amount may possibly escalate to $7 billion, provided discoveries were made.Given that the Red Sea in Egypt requires heavy investments for research, exploration and development in future stages, the involvement of global companies in oil-related development creates a climate conducive to attract lucrative investments. The African country appreciates such international participation as the international players possess cutting-edge technologies with years of experience to work in sites like the Red Sea.Royal Dutch Shell PLC PriceRoyal Dutch Shell PLC PriceMoreRoyal Dutch Shell PLC price | Royal Dutch Shell PLC QuoteSince the finding of the Zohr field in 2016 by Italy-based Eni SpA E, Egypt started bidding exploration rights.
