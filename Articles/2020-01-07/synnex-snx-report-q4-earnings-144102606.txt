Strong performance in all the end markets including the SMB is expected to have been a tailwind.Growth in product areas, such as PCs, networking and cloud plus software-related solutions is likely to have boosted the Technology Solutions business.Moreover, the company’s buyout of Covergys is expected to have been a key consistent driver. Further, new business wins, backed by the company’s widening footprint and enriched capabilities of its recent acquisition, might have been key catalysts.However, macro issues and other hurdles in the current environment make us apprehensive.Sequentially, Technology Solutions’ top-line growth is likely to have been a bit persistently muted compared with the previous years, mainly due to the solid progress that the company witnessed in the fiscal third quarter.What Our Model SaysThe proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for SYNNEX this time around.
