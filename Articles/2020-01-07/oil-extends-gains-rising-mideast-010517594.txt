"Because any attack on the oil infrastructure would most likely rally the barrel and that would, in turn, most likely shut down Iranian exports."Oil jumped more than 3% on Friday after a U.S. air strike in Iraq killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, heightening concerns about an escalation in conflict in the Middle East and the possible impact on oil supplies.The region accounts for nearly half of the world's oil production, with a fifth of global oil shipments passing through the Strait of Hormuz.U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to impose sanctions on Iraq, the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), if U.S. troops were forced to withdraw from the country.Iraq's parliament earlier called, in a nonbinding resolution, on U.S. and other foreign troops to leave Iraq.Trump also said that the United States would retaliate against Iran if Tehran were to strike back after the killing."I don't think we're out of the woods when it comes to whether this problem could effect oil in a way that would be tangible to oil traders," said Amy Jaffe, director of a program on energy security and climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations.In post-settlement trade, oil turned negative after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released data that showed money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions.OPEC oil output fell in December as Nigeria and Iraq adhered more closely to pledged reductions and top exporter Saudi Arabia made further cuts ahead of a new production-limiting accord, a Reuters survey found.(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London and Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Jonathan Oatis)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersAt least 7 Iranian government officials have coronavirusThe WeekWorld prepares for coronavirus pandemic; global recession forecastReutersOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
