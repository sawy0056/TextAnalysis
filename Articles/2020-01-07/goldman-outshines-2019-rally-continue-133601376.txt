Though trading activities were muted all through 2019, the same is likely to have improved since the tail end of the year.Positive developments related to the long-standing U.S.-Sino trade conflict, and strong probability of Brexit within Jan 31, 2020 might also be catalysts.With the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged this year, banks are anticipated to benefit from rise in demand for loans in the upcoming period. This, along with strong domestic economy, will keep boosting banks’ financials despite several geopolitical concerns.

Notably, Goldman has been undertaking initiatives to boost the GS Bank’s business, with its acquisition of the online deposit platform of GE Capital Bank in April 2016. It also rolled out a digital consumer lending platform — Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Additionally, the company is likely to benefit from its exposure to the fast-growing exchange-traded funds (ETF) market.In addition, Goldman’s solid global position and completed M&As will likely lend it a further edge over peers. Moreover, the bank benefited over the past few years from its successful expense-reduction initiatives. Notably, the company completed an expense initiative and generated nearly $900 million of run-rate savings. The company is focused on improving efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities.Driven by a solid capital position, Citigroup remains committed toward enhancing shareholders’ value on steady capital-deployment activities. The company’s approved 2019 capital plan includes up to $7 billion in repurchases and $1.8 billion in total common stock dividends beginning third-quarter 2019 through second-quarter 2020.
