After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put H&R Block, Inc. HRB stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, H&R Block has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.81, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.19. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, H&R Block’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.75. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that H&R Block has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.56, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for H&R Block stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, H&R Block has a P/S ratio of about 1.49. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.49 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, HRB is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, H&R Block currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes H&R Block a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for H&R Block is just 0.96, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.37. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.88, which is far better than the industry average of 10.67. Clearly, HRB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though H&R Block might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B. This gives HRB a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B.

The current fiscal year as well as the next fiscal year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower.As a result, the current fiscal year consensus estimate has risen by 21.9% in the past two months, while the next fiscal year estimate has increased 25%.

QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineH&R Block is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 7%) and a top Zacks Rank instills investor confidence.However, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in H&R Block.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
