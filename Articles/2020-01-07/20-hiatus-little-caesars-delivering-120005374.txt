Little Caesars last delivered pizzas over 20 years ago, but back then delivery service was offered at far fewer locations. Little Caesars is bringing delivery back because it is now feasible to offer the service while keeping prices in line with its brand, according to a statement.View photosLittle Caesars pizza delivery is here.More“We’ve seen such expensive and complex pricings throughout the pizza industry, and we think it’s crazy,” said David Scrivano, President & CEO for Little Caesars. “Some chains require a minimum purchase to get their deals, or the discount pricing is only available on carry-out orders. We’re excited to bring much needed affordability to delivered pizza.”Customers will be able to get Little Caesars specialties like Crazy Bread delivered through the company's website, or the Little Caesar app. There will also be no minimum charge to qualify for a delivery order, though a $2.99 delivery fee will be added on to every delivery order, along with a 10% service fee that maxes out at $3.00. Without delivery, Little Caesars had specialized in carry-out service, which has most recently been symbolized by the company's Hot-N-Ready pizza, which is available in minutes at all Little Caesars locations. How much bacon?: Little Caesars is bringing back its deep dish pizza wrapped in 3 1/2 feet of baconAutomation in the pizza biz: Robots may be delivering your Domino's pizzaAccording to industry data website Statista, Americans spend about $33 billion on pizza every year, and about $10 billion on pizza delivery.
