(NASDAQ: SNES), a developer of proprietary technologies for managing animal pest populations through fertility control, announced today that it had signed a distribution agreement with New Enterprises Ltd for the marketing and sales of ContraPest® in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.SenesTech, Inc. has developed an innovative technology for managing animal pest populations through fertility control as opposed to a lethal approach. The Company's first fertility control product, ContraPest(R), is marketed for use initially in controlling rat infestations. (PRNewsfoto/SenesTech, Inc.) (PRNewsfoto/SenesTech, Inc.)MoreThe agreement calls for New Enterprises to secure regulatory approval and develop the markets at its expense, and New Enterprises will be responsible for all importation of ContraPest into those markets from SenesTech's U.S. production facilities. The agreement further contains minimum performance requirements."This agreement allows SenesTech to continue to focus on our domestic development, while still potentially benefiting from overseas market opportunities. New Enterprises is well qualified to develop the Maritime Southeast Asian market and, as one of our pre-IPO investors, has good insights into the potential of ContraPest," said Kenneth Siegel, SenesTech's CEO.  "This sort of structure may prove useful in other parts of the world as well."About SenesTech SenesTech is changing the paradigm of pest management by targeting the root cause of the problem: reproduction.ContraPest® is an innovative technology with an approach that targets the reproductive capabilities of both sexes in rat populations, inducing egg loss in female rats and impairing sperm development in males. Using a proprietary bait delivery method, ContraPest® is dispensed in a highly palatable liquid formulation that promotes sustained consumption by rat communities. ContraPest® is designed, formulated and dispensed to be low hazard for handlers and non-target species such as wildlife, livestock and pets, where the active ingredients break down rapidly.We believe ContraPest® will establish a new paradigm in rodent control, resulting in a decreased reliance on lethal options.
