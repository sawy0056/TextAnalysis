He ended up in Lebanon, where it's unlikely he'll face extradition.GHOSN SNUCK ONTO BULLET TRAIN IN DARING ESCAPE FROM JAPANGhosn had help from two American operatives, including ex-Green Beret Michael L. Taylor, according to The Journal. They started planning his escape more than three months in advance and pinpointed a big gap in airport security.The airport's scanners were too small for oversized luggage, and its private jet terminal was empty much of the time, according to The Journal. Ghosn was smuggled out in a box with breathing holes on the bottom. It was made to look like it was holding concert equipment.Ghosn, who is of Lebanese heritage, was arrested in November 2018 on financial misconduct charges of under-reporting his future compensation and breach of trust. He was out on bail in Japan – and was supposedly being watched closely – when he fled the country.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREInvestigators probing the getaway took seven people into custody on Thursday, though it wasn’t immediately clear if charges were filed. Meanwhile, prosecutors in Japan, which does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon, announced the procurement of Ghosn’s Red Notice that same day.A Red Notice is a "be-on-the-lookout"-type memo issued by Interpol – the International Criminal Police Organization – to its nearly 200 member countries asking that the wanted person be extradited to the country from which he or she is a fugitive.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSThe Associated Press and FOX Business' Stephanie Pagones contributed to this report.Related ArticlesThe U.S. Economy is Sucking WindUber Races Ahead to Get Self-Driving Cars on the RoadHave $4.5M to Spare?
