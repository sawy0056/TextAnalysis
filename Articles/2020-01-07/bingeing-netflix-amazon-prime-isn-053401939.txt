When it comes to sports, several binge-watched football, especially when the leagues were on.”The app’s survey was conducted among 500 nutritionists and trainers to gauge the diet and workout trends of Indians in 2019. The UK’s first black royal has already walked awayHealth-consciousYet, Indians were conscious of what they ate, often giving in to popular health and diet trends.In 2019, the ketogenic diet (with low carbs and higher fat and protein content) and intermittent fasting (which requires one to have food only during a small time window) were the top diet plans Indians followed.Some fashionable food choices like chia seeds and green tea also featured on people’s plates. Others took the more traditional route, increasing the quantity of ragi, ghee, and turmeric in their meals.Indians also proved to be early risers in 2019, with nutritionists reporting that 70% of their clients liked working out between 4am and noon. Only 30% of these nutritionists’ clients reported exercise times between 4pm and 8pm. Running marathons emerged as the most popular fitness option among Indians. Yoga still remains the old-school favourite, followed closely by CrossFit. Sign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world’s most important and interesting news.More stories from Quartz:Chinese nationals caught surveilling same US military base twice in 2 weeksAs India rises in dissent, Bollywood reveals its real heroes: the womenReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThese Are the Healthiest Drinks & Snacks at Starbucks, According to NutritionistsPureWowCarrie Underwood's 'Pregnancy Insomnia' Ended Up Being a Blessing: It's When She Wrote Her New Book!PeopleSupporting worker sleep is good for businessThe ConversationBeautyblender’s Concealer Makes It Look Like I Actually SleptGlamourSalaries for Some of America’s Toughest JobsGOBankingRatesRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
