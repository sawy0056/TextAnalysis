(CSE:IAN)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosiAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc.'s (CSE:IAN): iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc. owns and operates licensed cannabis cultivation, processing, and dispensary facilities in the United States. The CA$348m market-cap company’s loss lessens since it announced a -US$62.0m bottom-line in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of -US$58.8m, as it approaches breakeven. Many investors are wondering the rate at which IAN will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” Below I will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for IAN. See our latest analysis for iAnthus Capital Holdings Consensus from the 8 Pharmaceuticals analysts is IAN is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2020, before generating positive profits of US$53m in 2021. So, IAN is predicted to breakeven approximately a couple of months from now! In order to meet this breakeven date, I calculated the rate at which IAN must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 95% is expected, which is extremely buoyant. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.CNSX:IAN Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreUnderlying developments driving IAN’s growth isn’t the focus of this broad overview, though, take into account that generally pharmaceuticals, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means that a high growth rate is not unusual, especially if the company is currently in an investment period.Before I wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. IAN has managed its capital judiciously, with debt making up 18% of equity. This means that IAN has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital,and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Next Steps:This article is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis on IAN, so if you are interested in understanding the company at a deeper level, take a look at IAN’s company page on Simply Wall St. I’ve also compiled a list of key factors you should look at:Valuation: What is IAN worth today?
