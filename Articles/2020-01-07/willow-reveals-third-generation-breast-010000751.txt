Our first solution is the breast pump. When we looked at traditional pumps, we knew there had to be a better way, so we invented the world's first all-in-one, in-bra quiet wearable pump. Our patented technology mimics a baby's continuous suction, making it the only pump that can offer true spill-proof mobility.  Our life-changing breast pump discreetly tucks into a bra, without cords, dangling bottles or loud sucking noises — freeing moms up to pump wherever life takes them.  And we're the only breast pump with the flexibility of pumping directly into both spill-proof Milk Bags and a reusable Container.  We're just getting started in our mission to bring joy to motherhood with more innovative product solutions to come in 2020.
