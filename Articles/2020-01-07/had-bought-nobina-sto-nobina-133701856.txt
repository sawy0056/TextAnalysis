But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, Nobina AB (publ) (STO:NOBINA) shareholders have seen the share price rise 21% over three years, well in excess of the market return (16%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 14% in the last year , including dividends . View our latest analysis for Nobina To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Nobina achieved compound earnings per share growth of 8.7% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 6.6% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).OM:NOBINA Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Nobina the TSR over the last 3 years was 46%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveNobina produced a TSR of 14% over the last year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return of around 33%. On the other hand, the TSR over three years was worse, at just 13% per year. This suggests the company's position is improving.
