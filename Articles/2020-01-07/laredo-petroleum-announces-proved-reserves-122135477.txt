"Results in 2019 were driven by our outstanding operational performance and improved well productivity related to wider-spaced development. Development in 2020 will shift to our recent Howard County acquisition, as we seek to further improve corporate returns and Free Cash Flow1 generation through accretive acquisitions that target oily, high-margin inventory."ProductionLaredo exceeded both oil and total production guidance for the fourth consecutive quarter, with fourth-quarter 2019 oil production of 27.3 MBOPD beating guidance by 5% and total production of 84.0 MBOEPD beating guidance by 10%. Results throughout the year were driven by consistent operational efficiency gains that positively impacted cycle times and wider-spaced well packages that averaged 16% better than the Company's oil type curve for Upper/Middle Wolfcamp wells on Laredo's established acreage.ReservesThe Company grew total proved reserves by 23%, an increase of 55 million BOE, partially driven by results from wells developed with wider spacing versus wells developed in 2018 with tighter spacing. Additionally, Laredo has increased PUD bookings, primarily related to the Company's recently acquired Howard County acreage. The Company has chosen to increase PUD bookings compared to previous years, reflecting the certainty of the near-term development plan for the Howard County acreage.About LaredoLaredo Petroleum, Inc. is an independent energy company with headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of the Company's ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas prices, well spacing, drilling and production costs, availability and cost of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, negative revisions to reserve estimates and other factors as well as actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates. Estimates of ultimate recovery from reserves may change significantly as development of the Company's core assets provides additional data. In addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price declines or drilling cost increases. "Type curve" refers to a production profile of a well, or a particular category of wells, for a specific play and/or area. In addition, the Company's production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price declines or drilling cost increases.1 Free Cash FlowFree Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated as estimated cash flows from operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities, less estimated costs incurred, excluding non-budgeted acquisition costs.Contacts:Ron Hagood:  (918) 858-5504 - RHagood@laredopetro.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextConfidence returning for UK consumers and companies - surveysReuters'Apple Of Oil' Hikes Dividend, Cuts Capex After Bakken Leader Guides Cash Flow LowerInvestor's Business DailyConsumer-facing companies will be the first hit if the coronavirus spreads across the U.S.MarketWatchPittsburgh companies implement travel restrictions in response to coronavirus threatsAmerican City Business JournalsBeijing’s city government issued 10 anti-coronavirus rules for workplacesQuartzBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
