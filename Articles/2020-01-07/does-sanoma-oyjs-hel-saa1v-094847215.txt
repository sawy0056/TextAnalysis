When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Sanoma Oyj saw earnings per share decrease by 16% last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 63% per year over the last three years. And EPS is down 2.7% a year, over the last 5 years. This might lead to muted expectations.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Is Debt Impacting Sanoma Oyj's P/E?Net debt is 38% of Sanoma Oyj's market cap.
