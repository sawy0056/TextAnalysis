It also evaluates the impact of security functions across various technologies including Mobile Edge Computing, IoT networks, and general mobility infrastructure. The report includes detailed 5G security market forecasts for all major technologies, industry verticals, solutions and service types from 2019-2024.Select FindingsIoT services will drive more than 30% of the 5G security marketData security and user privacy are the prime security concerns for 5GNorth America will lead the 5G security market followed by Asia-PacificInfrastructure, apps, and data will be of equal importance for 5G securityFifth-generation (5G) cellular is poised to transform the ICT industry through substantially enhanced mobility services, massively scalable Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and support for critical apps and services by way of ultra-low latency communications. With these anticipated improvements come great responsibilities for privacy and security. The 5G Security Market must be robust as solutions need to be deployed on multiple levels including devices, air interface equipment, cloud RAN infrastructure, mobile backhaul facilities, and more. One of the biggest 5G security issues at the application layer is the many apps and services supported. With substantially greater bandwidth and ultra-low latency, 5G supports many new and improved apps and services such as untethered Virtual Reality and anytime, anywhere telepresence. Whether it is new immersive technologies or extension of existing apps such as Voice over 5G, there are some common security issues (such as data privacy) and some completely different issues, such as virtual identity theft in VR.Leading companies such as Palo Alto Networks, Cylance Inc. (BlackBerry), and others are poised to capitalize on the market for securing 5G based networks, systems, applications, and services. This includes the 5G security market for hardware, software, and data protection. With recent high-profile events such as alleged espionage on the part of Huawei, cybersecurity is also getting extreme attention at the government level.By way of example, The Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2019 is being introduced in the Senate by U.S. Among other areas, the Act is intended to address IoT device security relative to Secure Development, Identity management, Patching, and Configuration Management. Quoting opinions from market leaders (such as Cloudflare, Symantec, vmWave, and others), the bill asserts a desperate need for cybersecurity regulation. Many of these efforts will be focused on 5G related networks and systems in support of IoT.Key Topics Covered 1.
