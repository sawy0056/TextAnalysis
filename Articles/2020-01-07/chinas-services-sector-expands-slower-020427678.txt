Economic growth has cooled to near 30-year lows amid sluggish demand at home and abroad."China's economy is likely to get off to a quick start in 2020, but it will still be constrained by limited demand for the rest of the year," Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, wrote in a note accompanying the Caixin PMI release.Services companies surveyed expressed concerns over subdued economic conditions and a lack of staff, the Caixin survey showed. Their expectations regarding the one-year outlook for business activity fell to the second-lowest level since the series began in 2005.The pace of job creation was also more modest, with the employment sub-index hitting the lowest level since July. Meanwhile, input costs continued to rise, while firms had to lower their selling prices for the first time in over a year, squeezing companies' profit margins.That was despite a faster rise in the volume of new work in December, suggesting some companies were cutting prices to promote sales amid fierce competition."It is difficult for the measure of business confidence, which remained at a relatively low level in December, to improve. That has become a major hurdle to stabilizing the economy," Zhong said.While domestic demand picked up somewhat in December, new orders from overseas weakened to the worst level in six months, deteriorating notably from November.Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Monday, slowed to 52.6 in December from 53.2 in November.While the "Phase one" trade deal with the United States, which is expected to be signed on Jan. 15, will ease some of the pressure on exporters by reducing U.S. tariffs, analysts at NatWest markets said a recovery in the manufacturing sector is unlikely be sustainable if further tariff escalation remains a threat."We expect the stronger recovery momentum in the services sector to partially offset the downside risks of the manufacturing sector outlook into 2020," they wrote in a note.(Reporting by Yawen Chen and Kevin Yao; Editing by Kim Coghill)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNigeria confirms coronavirus case, first in sub-Saharan AfricaAFPBaidu warns of big hit from coronavirus outbreakAFPKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergIs China Golden Classic Group (HKG:8281) Using Too Much Debt?Simply Wall St.The 6 largest coronavirus outbreaks outside of ChinaCBS NewsRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
