The lead investigator is Justin Eyquem, PhD, a Principal Investigator in the Microbiology & Immunology Department at UCSF. Cytovia will have an exclusive option to license certain patentable inventions developed as part of the research program.Dr Daniel Teper, CEO of Cytovia said: “Cytovia is committed to advancing the development of NK biotherapeutics with a primary focus on off the shelf CAR NK cells and multispecific antibodies. The partnership with UCSF will utilize advanced gene editing technology to develop precision CAR NK cell therapeutics for both solid and hematological cancers”.Dr Justin Eyquem, of UCSF added: “With their safer profile, their natural antitumor activity through a variety of receptors and their allogeneic potential, NK cells are a great addition to the adoptive therapy field. We strongly believe that precision gene editing and rational CAR design will not only make CAR NK cells stronger and safer, but also greatly standardize their manufacturing.”About Cytovia Therapeutics: Cytovia is dedicated to the development of transformational cancer immunotherapies, addressing several of the most challenging unmet medical needs including the prevention of cancer relapse and metastasis.
