Megvii and a Hong Kong Stock Exchange spokesman also declined to comment.Megvii filed its listing application on Aug. 25 and under the Hong Kong Stock Exchange rules has six months to list from that date.However, it can apply for a three month extension once that deadline has passed, according to stock exchange rules.A time table for the deal has yet to be put in place and sources said the company would wait until after the Chinese New Year holidays, which start on Jan. 25, when financial markets start to rev up for the year.Hong Kong is entering a seventh month of pro-democracy protests and the listing of a Chinese facial recognition company is expected to be closely watched by local activists.Megvii was founded in 2011 by Chief Executive Yin Qi and two friends from Tsinghua University. The company provides AI technology to governments and companies including Alibaba, Ant Financial and Huawei.The company raised $750 million in May, which valued it at slightly over $4 billion, and attracted investors including Australian investment bank Macquarie Group and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.(Reporting by Scott Murdoch and Julie Zhu; Editing by Mark Potter)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPHong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested on illegal assembly chargesReutersUS, European stocks plunge, extending rout amid virus fearsAFPDoorDash Files Confidentially for IPOThe Wall Street JournalBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
