Davis veteran Danton Goei has managed a portion of this strategy since its late-2004 inception (in the US), but he didn't oversee the whole portfolio until 2016. The strategy initially used an analyst-led multimanager approach that divided its asset base into independent sleeves run by Goei and fellow analysts Jae Chung, Stephen Chen, and Tania Pouschine. Firm CEO Christopher Davis allocated capital between the sleeves but did not manage money (except for a contrarian bet on some real estate stocks from 2008 to 2010). Goei's sleeve drove the fund's outperformance over the years. The other analysts' sleeves did not fare as well. Chung left the firm in 2009, Chen in 2014, and Pouschine at year-end 2015, leaving Goei as the last manager standing. He has meaningfully invested across multiple Davis strategies, including its Global Equity capability.Investment personnel turnover at Davis has been significant. Besides the departures noted already, manager Ken Feinberg and six analysts have left over the past decade. Yet, the seven-person analyst team that remains has an experienced core. Four analysts joined Davis between 1995 and 2008, and Kent Whitaker, who rejoined in 2014, had a prior stint between 1999 and 2005. Potent. This strategy has no trouble playing offence. More than half of its portfolio was in its top 10 holdings in 2019. Since taking control of the whole portfolio in 2016, portfolio manager Danton Goei has kept a sizable weighting in online retail and split the equity portfolio roughly 50/50 between the United States and the rest of the world. Goei has also concentrated the portfolio, trimming the number of holdings and deploying more capital into the top holdings.Emerging-markets exposure, especially Asia, is significant. More than one third of this vehicle was held in emerging markets in September 2019, mostly in China. Chinese stock exposure spans across the market cap spectrum, marked by a double-digit allocation to New Oriental & Education in September 2019.Traditional value stocks such as Wells Fargo and elevator and plane engine maker United Technologies have also been held. Goei has also found more-cautious ways to invest in high-flying growth stocks, such as buying South African media company Naspers for exposure to Chinese gaming company Tencent. Still, this is an aggressive portfolio and its chunky exposure to emerging markets leaves it best placed as a Supporting Player. The firm managed about USD 2.2 billion in this strategy as at 30 June 2019. A bold approach that pays little heed to indexes in portfolio construction. Davis applies an eclectic and aggressive investment process to choosing global companies. This growth-oriented strategy is prepared to invest in quality, well-managed businesses at a fair price rather than simply favouring cheaper securities. Companies with perceived defensible competitive advantages that are spending cash flow almost as fast as they generate it to grab market share and build their businesses are investable.Davis appraises companies based on owner earnings, or cash flow adjusted for reinvestments in the business, depreciation, stock options, and other items. This strategy uses a 10% annualised gain over a five-year period as a baseline, insisting on greater return potential for riskier stocks. The manager prefers firms with defensible edges--such as innovative products, high switching costs, and trusted brands--run by executives who know how to protect and extend their advantages through prudent reinvestment. This ideally leads to companies that can compound shareholder returns over the long term and foster healthy capital structures and returns on invested capital throughout market cycles.This strategy will generally hold 35-50 securities. Portfolio turnover tends to be relatively low at about 30% per year. Concentration and willingness to assume price and sector risk makes this more of a supporting player than a core holding. Supporting Player A long-tenured investor remains daringly different, but portfolio construction leaves questions. Pan-Tribal Global Equity pulls no punches. While we acknowledge Danton Goei's commendable record in backing hidden gems, this portfolio's increasingly top-heavy composition amplifies the risk of its longstanding tilt to emerging countries.Story continuesUS-based Davis Advisors manages this strategy and Danton Goei is the sole portfolio manager. He has managed this strategy solely since 2016 but has long set the tone in a US vehicle. Goei had been part of a four-person multimanager setup before the last of his three counterparts left. While these changes are not inconsequential, Goei has a credible history and works alongside experienced analysts. Staff also invest significantly alongside unitholders. Goei ultimately remains a key-person risk given the eclectic, high-conviction positions taken.In this growth-leaning, benchmark-unaware approach, Goei has steadily ratcheted up this strategy's risk profile. The emerging-markets weighting rose to more than one third of the portfolio in 2019, mostly in China. He's also reduced the stock count to 35-50 positions, taking bigger bets in the largest exposures. Not everything has changed--themes remain important, such as e-commerce growth supporting technology holdings, and the team remain patient investors, which we like. However, while this has always been a relatively aggressive strategy, portfolio construction changes give us pause. Notably, it's hard to fathom how top holding New Oriental & Education (12% in November 2019) is almost twice the size of the next largest exposure. The team has less margin for error now, and accounting for downside risks has not been the strongest feature of this approach, in our opinion. While we're wary of over-reacting to short-term numbers, numerous potholes meant that this portfolio delivered sub-par returns during 2018/19 despite massive gains from New Oriental & Education. That said, this profile is in keeping with the strategy's tendency to excel during more benign conditions and trail under market duress.This team is respectable, but Pan-Tribal is shaded by some peers. 1776 Davis Advisors retains an Above Average Parent rating as its strengths outweigh its weaknesses.The U.S. equity-oriented shop is a standout in many respects. Davis family leadership has been a source of stability for 50 years and counting. The firm has also made room for nonfamily members, including Danton Goei, who is a full portfolio manager alongside CEO Christopher Davis. The flagship Davis New York Venture has fared well over the past two-plus decades through October 2019. While the lineup has struggled since the 2007-09 credit crisis, Davis investment personnel have felt the pain, too, as they invest alongside fundholders at industry-leading levels. The firm has kept its historic expertise in financials companies while venturing with some success into arenas like private placements where active managers can add value.Still, firmwide outflows for more than a decade have begun to take their toll. The pressure to turn around performance has contributed to investment personnel turnover, though none since early 2018. It has also amplified the lineup's risk profile in terms of increased concentration and the degree of relatively illiquid private placement holdings, which push the boundaries of prudence in open-end vehicles. Indeed, private stakes in the firm's smaller open-end strategies have exceeded 10% of assets and peaked near 13%, not far from the SEC's 15% hard cap. Strengths still outweigh weaknesses. 2019-11-18T15:15:00 2019-11-18T21:15:00Z Has experienced significant ups and downs. Pan-Tribal Global Equity has lagged the index since launch in Australia in late 2014 through to 31 Oct 2019, enduring a volatile ride. After an indexlike result in 2016, high-flying tech stocks such as Alibaba Group, Amazon.com, Alphabet, and JD.com propelled this portfolio past much of its cohort in 2017. Its fortunes reversed during 2018, particularly during the spike in risk aversion late in the year. Several Chinese stocks fell sharply, including the aforementioned JD.com and New Oriental Education & Technology Group, while automotive parts manufacturer Adient also stumbled. This strategy rebounded to surpass the benchmark during the first 10 months of 2019, as New Oriental Education & Technology continued to surge, as did Sul America. Meanwhile, heavy falls in energy duo Encana and Apache, and Adient and Danske Bank also detracted.A similar longer-running US vehicle (but with exposure to unlisted securities) has fared reasonably against the global equities index since the start of 2007. Manager Danton Goei's sleeve has contributed most to the track record, and he's had sole control since the end of 2015.Sizable losses have materialised at times. In the 2007-09 credit crisis, a hefty allocation to financials stocks contributed to a nearly 66% peak-to-trough loss. Holding timber firm Sino-Forest proved disastrous in 2011, causing significant underperformance. It's critical to evaluate expenses, as they come directly out of returns. The share class on this report levies a fee that ranks in its Morningstar category's middle quintile. That's not great, and based on our assessment of the fund's People, Process and Parent pillars in the context of these fees, we don't think this share class will be able to deliver positive alpha relative to the category benchmark index, explaining its Morningstar Analyst Rating of Neutral.
