But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Isra Vision (ETR:ISR). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. Check out our latest analysis for Isra Vision How Fast Is Isra Vision Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price will eventually follow. It's no surprise, then, that I like to invest in companies with EPS growth. Isra Vision managed to grow EPS by 15% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Isra Vision shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 20% to 23%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in my book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

So it is good to see that Isra Vision insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Notably, they have an enormous stake in the company, worth €208m. Coming in at 25% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.Is Isra Vision Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Isra Vision is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination appeals to me, for one. So yes, I do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Isra Vision is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Although Isra Vision certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
