(NYSE:CPF), operating in the financial services industry based in United States, saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$30.38 and falling to the lows of US$27.60. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Central Pacific Financial's current trading price of US$29.44 reflective of the actual value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Central Pacific Financial’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Central Pacific Financial What is Central Pacific Financial worth?According to my valuation model, Central Pacific Financial seems to be fairly priced at around 7.8% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Central Pacific Financial today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $31.92, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Central Pacific Financial’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Central Pacific Financial generate?NYSE:CPF Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.
