Shares A Year Ago Are Now Up 21%Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosThese days it's easy to simply buy an index fund, and your returns should (roughly) match the market. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the National Grid plc (LON:NG.) share price is up 21% in the last year, clearly besting the market return of around 14% (not including dividends). That's a solid performance by our standards! In contrast, the longer term returns are negative, since the share price is 7.7% lower than it was three years ago. View our latest analysis for National Grid In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last twelve months, National Grid actually shrank its EPS by 57%.So we don't think that investors are paying too much attention to EPS. Indeed, when EPS is declining but the share price is up, it often means the market is considering other factors.For starters, we suspect the share price has been buoyed by the dividend, which was increased during the year. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield, pushing the price up in the process.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).LSE:NG. Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreNational Grid is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think National Grid will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, National Grid's TSR for the last year was 29%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that National Grid has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 29% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 5.7% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
