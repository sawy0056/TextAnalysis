When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. For example, the Hop Hing Group Holdings Limited (HKG:47) share price is down 34% in the last year. That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 14%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 21% in the last three years. View our latest analysis for Hop Hing Group Holdings While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Hop Hing Group Holdings the TSR over the last year was -31%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveHop Hing Group Holdings shareholders are down 31% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 14%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.4% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
