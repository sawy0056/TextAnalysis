This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. Check out our latest analysis for Guardian Capital Group How Does George Mavroudis's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, Guardian Capital Group Limited has a market capitalization of CA$675m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth CA$2.5m over the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at CA$500k. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. We examined companies with market caps from CA$260m to CA$1.0b, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was CA$1.3m.Thus we can conclude that George Mavroudis receives more in total compensation than the median of a group of companies in the same market, and of similar size to Guardian Capital Group Limited. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the pay is too high. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into the underlying business performance.You can see, below, how CEO compensation at Guardian Capital Group has changed over time.TSX:GCG.A CEO Compensation, January 6th 2020MoreIs Guardian Capital Group Limited Growing?Guardian Capital Group Limited has reduced its earnings per share by an average of 23% a year, over the last three years (measured with a line of best fit).
