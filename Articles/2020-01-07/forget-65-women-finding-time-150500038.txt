Core – we mean chore – workout: Over 80% say that household chores count as cardio. 60% of women prescribe to the mantra, "everything in moderation, including moderation," especially when it comes to their diet: A slice of heaven: 71% agree veggie pizza should always count as a serving of vegetables. Reshaping the food pyramid: Over 70% say they'd choose to replace one of the five basic food groups with an indulgence like baked goods, caffeine, or alcohol. Wellness is also about finding balance and headspace:A daily cup of Zen: More than 80% say their first sip of coffee or tea in the morning is their daily moment of Zen. Early mornings for the win: Nearly all moms (90%) say they're "doing it right" if they can get their kids out the door to school on time."The 'Yeah. You're doing it right.' campaign highlights and celebrates how different people define wellness in their lives each and every day," said Rachel Carlisle, assistant marketing manager for Truvia® sweetener. "As a brand that's all about adding a little sweetness to your day, Truvia® products can easily fit into any wellness routine – whether that means enjoying a quiet cup of coffee or indulging in a post-workout treat made with our stevia sweetener."To bring this new definition of wellness to life, Truvia® sweetener is creating the Tru To You: Real Life Wellness pop-up in New York City. Open to the public on January 10 and January 11, the brand is reimagining the ultimate symbol of resolution season – the gym – allowing visitors to experience everything from work-life balance-inspired yoga to a Smooth(ie) Operator station featuring blended, reduced-sugar treats.For more information about the pop-up, click here to view the event details or follow #yeahyouredoingitright on social media.About Truvia® Sweetener: Sweetness is meant to be enjoyed.
