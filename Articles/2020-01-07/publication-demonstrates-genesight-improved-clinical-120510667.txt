(NASDAQ: MYGN, “Myriad” or the “Company”), a global leader in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine, announced that a new analysis of the GUIDED1 clinical trial using the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D6) was published online in BMC Psychiatry. The key finding is the HAM-D6 scale identified statistically significant improvements in all three clinical endpoints – remission, response and symptoms – between GeneSight®-guided care and treatment-as-usual at Week 8 (Figure 1).“The HAM-D6 scale has been shown to be a better measure of core depressive symptoms than the HAM-D17 scale,” said Boadie W. Dunlop, M.D., one of the study investigators and associate professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine. “This post hoc analysis provides further evidence that the GeneSight test led to significant and clinically meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with major depressive disorder relative to treatment-as-usual care.”To view Figure 1: GeneSight Test Significantly Improved Clinical Outcomes by Week 8 (HAM-D6), please visit the following link: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/980daabb-fd8c-4bbb-b56e-48795fa16bdbThe GUIDED study was the largest prospective study to assess the benefit of pharmacogenomics-guided treatment for depression using the GeneSight Psychotropic test versus an active therapy control arm. All patients in the GUIDED study had the 17-item HAM-D17 questionnaire administered by blinded off-site raters as part of the study protocol. The 6-item HAM-D6 score represents a subset of HAM-D17 questions that have been shown to be more directly linked to depression. For example, questions such as “have you had trouble sleeping” which could be associated with conditions other than depression are excluded from the HAM-D6 score. Clinical studies have shown that the HAM-D6 score is superior to HAM-D17 at discriminating antidepressants from placebo.About GeneSight® PsychotropicGeneSight Psychotropic is a pharmacogenomic test that analyzes clinically important variations in DNA. The results of the test can inform doctors about genes that may impact how their patients metabolize or respond to depression medications.About Myriad GeneticsMyriad Genetics Inc., is a leading precision medicine company dedicated to being a trusted advisor transforming patient lives worldwide with pioneering molecular diagnostics.
