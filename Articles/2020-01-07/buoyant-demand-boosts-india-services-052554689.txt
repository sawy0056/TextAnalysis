Service providers were more optimistic about growth in the year ahead and international demand continued to rise.A strong service sector is crucial India as it contributes over 60% of gross domestic product. If the momentum can be sustained, it would drive a faster economic recovery.A sister survey on Friday showed factory activity accelerated at the fastest pace in seven months in December on strong domestic demand and output.Taken together, they pushed the composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, to 53.7 last month from November's 52.7, its highest in five months."With manufacturing sector weakness also fading in December, what was anticipated to be a disappointing private sector performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019/20 is now looking brighter," De Lima said.However, prices charged by service firms increased at the fastest pace in nearly two years after a sharper rise in input cost forced businesses to transfer some of the inflationary pressure to consumers.That suggests overall inflation could rise further and remain above the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4%, giving little scope for the central bank to lower interest rates again.(Reporting by Vivek Mishra; Editing by Kim Coghill)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump campaign ads target a new audience: Indian AmericansPoliticoUS urges India to allow peaceful assembly after riotsAFPA Delhi neighborhood divided by a highway and now hatredReutersIndia’s Fragile Economic Rebound Faces New Risk From CoronavirusBloombergThe Unlikely Relationship of Trump and ModiNational ReviewRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
