This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Kinepolis Group NV (EBR:KIN), by way of a worked example.Our data shows Kinepolis Group has a return on equity of 27% for the last year. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each €1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made €0.27 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Kinepolis Group How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Kinepolis Group:27% = €47m ÷ €177m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does ROE Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Kinepolis Group Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Kinepolis Group has a higher ROE than the average (12%) in the Entertainment industry.ENXTBR:KIN Past Revenue and Net Income, January 6th 2020MoreThat's clearly a positive. I usually take a closer look when a company has a better ROE than industry peers. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining Kinepolis Group's Debt And Its 27% Return On EquityKinepolis Group clearly uses a significant amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.90. I think the ROE is impressive, but it would have been assisted by the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.But It's Just One MetricReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Story continuesIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss thisfree list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
