It's likely just a first step towards monetizing more of its ownership position over time," said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.Occidental on Sunday gave up over 9 million shares, or a 2% stake in Western Midstream's general partner, and allowed limited partners to remove Occidental and appoint a new general partner. (http://bit.ly/39Nbnoi)Occidental fully owns the general partner stake, which effectively controls Western Midstream, a master limited partnership, and around 55% of the pipeline operator's limited partner units.Western Midstream's limited partner units rose 3.6% to $21.54 on Monday.(Reporting by Shariq Khan and Arunima Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Shounak Dasgupta)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Reports Q4 Loss, Tops Revenue EstimatesZacks'Apple Of Oil' Hikes Dividend, Cuts Capex After Bakken Leader Guides Cash Flow LowerInvestor's Business DailyOccidental posts quarterly loss on impairment, chargesReutersEquitrans Midstream Corporation (ETRN) Surpasses Q4 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesZacksZacks Market Edge Highlights: Occidental Petroleum, Expedia, United Airlines, Royal Caribbean and FacebookZacksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
