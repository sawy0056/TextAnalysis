With the enormous increasing popularity of exosome therapy in the US, Dr. Riazifar's knowledge and experience on the topic will be a first rate addition to the training course.Dr. Riazifar has been working on stem cell and exosome research for over a decade. During his Ph.D studies at the Stem Cell Research Center at UC Irvine, he pioneered a cell-free exosome based approach to treat Multiple Sclerosis. While at City of Hope, he was part of a clinical translation team initiating the world's first clinical trial using stem cell exosomes for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.He is very well published, and presents frequently on both stem cell science and cell free exosome therapies as part of the Director of Research and Development at Invitrx Labs. The title of his presentation at the Training Course will be "Developing cell-free therapeutics for autoimmune diseases".According to R3 CEO David Greene, MD, MBA, "Milad is a fountain of knowledge regarding exosomes and the science of stem cell therapy.
