"By partnering with Quorn, we were able to create the taste, texture and crispiness of our world-famous chicken wings perfectly. Similar to our launch of smoked wings and roasted wings with half the calories of our regular wings, the Unreal wings provide our guests a healthier option without compromising on the full Hooters Wing flavor they know and love."All Quorn products are entirely meat-free and provide a great tasting nutrient-rich protein source low in cholesterol and saturated fats. Quorn products are sustainably produced, using less land and water to produce than meat."We've been in the meat alternative game since the 1980s, and the new Hooters Unreal Wings taste just as good as chicken," says Kevin Brennan, Chief Executive Officer of Quorn Foods. "The rise of meatless options especially at quick service and fast casual restaurants has largely centered on burgers, and we're excited to partner with Hooters to roll out the first meatless poultry item on a national scale in the US."For more information and updates about the Unreal Wings at Hooters, visit Hooters.com.About QuornQuorn Foods is a global market leader in meat alternative foods with nearly 5 billion meals served since 1985.
