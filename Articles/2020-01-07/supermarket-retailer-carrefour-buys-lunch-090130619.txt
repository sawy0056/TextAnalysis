It employs around 300 staff."It will give us the opportunity to expand our customer base to include employees of medium-sized, small and micro businesses and also invest in the fast-growing food delivery segment," Amélie Oudéa-Castera, Executive Director Customers, Services and Digital Transformation at Carrefour, said on Monday.At 0815 GMT, Carrefour shares were down 2.1% at 14.71 euros in a weak European stock market.The company is in the midst of a five-year plan to cut costs and invest in e-commerce, as well as organic and own-brand products, to try to tackle competition from the likes of domestic rival Leclerc and online giant Amazon."Obviously we can see some fit with Carrefour's stated strategy of catching up in e-commerce but it simply feels a step too far to be able to make a meaningful contribution to the turnaround of the core business," Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said in a note."We would rather see progress in the core/legacy business (branded products in hypermarkets) than adding a whole new product segment for a whole new customer base," he added.($1 = 0.8948 euros)(Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Louise Heavens and Mark Potter)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRetailer Carrefour raises cost savings goal as 2019 core profits riseReutersCarrefour Plans Further Real Estate Disposals as Profit ImprovesWWDCarrefour swings to 2019 profit and raises 2022 targetsMarketWatchRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
