(NASDAQ:BGCP) On Your Watch List?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosBGC Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGCP), which is in the capital markets business, and is based in United States, saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a US$2.3b market cap stock, it seems odd BGC Partners is not more well-covered by analysts. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing given that there are less eyes on the stock to push it closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine BGC Partners’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for BGC Partners What is BGC Partners worth?BGC Partners appears to be overvalued according to my relative valuation model. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that BGC Partners’s ratio of 41.21x is above its peer average of 34.9x, which suggests the stock is overvalued compared to the Capital Markets industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that BGC Partners’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will BGC Partners generate?NasdaqGS:BGCP Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. BGC Partners’s revenue growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. Unless expenses grow at the same level, or higher, this top-line growth should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder?

At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell?
