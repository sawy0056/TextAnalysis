The fund's prospectus or summary prospectus, which can be obtained by visiting Avantisinvestors.com or by calling 833-928-2684, contains this and other information about the fund, and should be read carefully before investing. Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are bought and sold through exchange trading at market price (not NAV), and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.* Expected Returns: Valuation theory shows that the expected return of a security is a function of its current price, book equity (assets minus liabilities) and expected future profits. Avantis uses information in current market prices and company financials to identify differences in expected returns among securities, seeking to overweight securities with higher expected returns based on this current market information. Actual returns may be different than expected returns, and there is no guarantee that the strategy will be successful.Foreside Fund Services, LLC – Distributor, not affiliated with American Century Investments Services, Inc.©2020 American Century Proprietary Holdings, Inc.
