Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group (HKG:564), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. View our latest analysis for Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group How Fast Is Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group has grown earnings per share (EPS) like young bamboo after rain; fast, and from a low base. So I don't think the percent growth rate is particularly meaningful. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Like the last firework on New Year's Eve accelerating into the sky, Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group's EPS shot from CN¥0.38 to CN¥0.69, over the last year. You don't see 83% year-on-year growth like that, very often.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). Not all of Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 21% to CN¥26b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group shares worth a considerable sum. To be specific, they have CN¥242m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 2.0% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.Does Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group's earnings per share have taken off like a rocket aimed right at the moon. That EPS growth certainly has my attention, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke my interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point; and I do like those. So to my mind Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.Story continuesYou can invest in any company you want.
