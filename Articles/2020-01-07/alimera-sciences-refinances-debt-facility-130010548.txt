(ALIM) (“Alimera”), a leader in the commercialization and development of prescription ophthalmology treatments for the management of retinal diseases, today announced that it refinanced its debt facility by entering into a new $45 million term loan agreement with its current lenders, investment affiliates managed by Solar Capital Partners, LLC, on December 31, 2019.The amount of the new funding includes an initial tranche of $42.5 million used to repay the current facility, including principal, prepayment fees and accrued interest, and another $2.5 million tranche that will be available if Alimera achieves $30.0 million in revenue for any trailing six-month period ending on or before November 30, 2020.The new loan agreement has a term of 54 months to July 1, 2024, with monthly interest-only payments to January 1, 2023, when principal amortization begins. The interest-only period may be extended an additional six months if Alimera achieves $34.5 million in revenue for any trailing six-month period ending on or before June 30, 2022.“We are pleased that Solar Capital has agreed to extend our relationship and continue working with Alimera in support of our future growth,” said Rick Eiswirth, Alimera’s president and chief executive officer. “As we stated in November, we believe we have sufficient cash on hand to fund our operations throughout 2020. The new terms of this debt facility defer the commencement of amortization payments from July 1, 2020 as previously scheduled to January 1, 2023 and mitigate the need for any additional financing during that period. We look forward to continuing to work with Solar, and to growing the ILUVIEN® franchise, helping patients see better, longer, with fewer intraocular injections.”“We are very pleased to refinance Alimera’s debt facility and to provide new terms that will help fund the Company’s continued commercial growth,” said Anthony Storino, Head of Solar Capital’s Life Science Lending platform. “We look forward to continuing our longstanding relationship with the Alimera team and supporting their focus on building a leading company delivering novel therapies to patients with retinal diseases.”No warrants were issued in connection with the term loan. For more details on the terms of the refinancing, including fees, please see Alimera’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which Alimera expects to file with the SEC promptly after issuing this press release.About Solar Capital Partners, LLC.

Alimera is presently focused on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or retina, because these diseases are not well treated with current therapies and will affect millions of people in our aging populations. For more information, please visit www.alimerasciences.com.About ILUVIEN ILUVIEN (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.19 mg is a sustained release intravitreal implant, injected into the back of the eye. With its CONTINUOUS MICRODOSINGTM technology, ILUVIEN is designed to release submicrogram levels of fluocinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid, for up to 36 months, to reduce the recurrence of disease, enabling patients to maintain vision longer with fewer injections. ILUVIEN is approved in the U.S., Canada, Kuwait, Lebanon and the U.A.E to treat diabetic macular edema (DME) in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure. In 17 European countries, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. In March 2019, ILUVIEN received approval in the 17 countries under the Mutual Recognition Procedure for prevention of relapse in recurrent non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye. The 17 European countries are the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The regulatory process is now in the national phase in which the European member states have finalized or are expected to finalize the label for the new indication to meet each country’s local requirements. Timeline to this goal varies by each country. ILUVIEN is not approved for treatment of uveitis in the United States.Story continuesForward Looking StatementsThis press release contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, regarding, among other things, Alimera’s future growth and its ability to achieve the revenue level required to access the additional $2.5 million from a future draw down.
