The predictive analytics tool provides forecasts based on the DAT RateView database of more than $68 billion in annual freight transactions."Knight-Swift is eager to begin testing DAT’s new rate forecasting tools,” said Don Everhart, VP Technology & Analytics for Knight-Swift Logistics. “In our experience, DAT is the most accurate and complete source of spot and contract rate data available. We are looking forward to applying these rate predictions to significantly improve the speed we can serve customers, while mitigating price risk."The pilot program will run through Q1. The DAT Rate Forecast will then be made widely available to third-party logistics providers, freight brokers, truck fleets, financial analysts, and other industry stakeholders at the start of Q2.“DAT’s data science team tested the rate prediction algorithms for months, back-checking its forecasts against actual results and refining the models to improve accuracy, but the partnership with Knight-Swift provides the perfect proving ground,” according to Ken Adamo, DAT Chief of Analytics."This pilot is an important step as we develop and broaden the commercial scope of our best-in-class forecasting tools,” explained Adamo. “Our forecasting is based on the most historically complete database on the market today.
