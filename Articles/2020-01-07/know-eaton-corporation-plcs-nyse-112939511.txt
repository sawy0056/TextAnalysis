We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Eaton Corporation plc's (NYSE:ETN), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Based on the last twelve months, Eaton's P/E ratio is 16.84. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying $16.84 for every $1 in prior year profit. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton How Do I Calculate Eaton's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Eaton:P/E of 16.84 = $95.16 ÷ $5.65 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Eaton's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (19.0) for companies in the electrical industry is higher than Eaton's P/E.NYSE:ETN Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Eaton shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.It's great to see that Eaton grew EPS by 15% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 9.7%. So one might expect an above average P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).How Does Eaton's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Eaton's net debt is 18% of its market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Bottom Line On Eaton's P/E RatioEaton's P/E is 16.8 which is below average (18.9) in the US market. The company hasn't stretched its balance sheet, and earnings growth was good last year. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
