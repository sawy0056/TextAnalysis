In addition to the increased durability shown below [Figure 1], Nano One's LNMO also eliminates cobalt from the battery, thereby addressing the ethical and supply chain issues related to artisanal cobalt mining in Africa for use in lithium ion batteries.To view Figure 1, please visit: https://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/3606/51162_9d5ff2506430491e_001full.jpgDr. Campbell said, “This addition to Nano One’s patent portfolio is an important, low cost durability improvement to LNMO. This material operates at high voltage with fast rates of charge and discharge, compared to other cathode materials. Our technology treats the surface of the discrete cathode crystals and it mitigates instabilities common to spinels including LNMO and enables elevated operating temperatures that are typical in electric vehicle batteries.”This represents the sixteenth patent in Nano One’s IP portfolio which extends to the U.S., Canada, China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.Nano One Materials Corp.Dan Blondal, CEO For information with respect to Nano One or the contents of this news release, please contact John Lando (President) at (604) 420-2041 or visit the website at www.nanoone.ca.About Nano OneNano One Materials Corp has developed patented technology for the low-cost production of high performance lithium ion battery cathode materials used in electric vehicles, energy storage and consumer electronics.
