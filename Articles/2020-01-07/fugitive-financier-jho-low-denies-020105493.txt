I was requested to assist because of my good relationships with influential foreign businessmen and decision makers."A spokesman for Low did not immediately respond to a request for additional comments.To a question on why he has remained on the run, Low said the Malaysian government has victimized him and his family, ignoring "basic human rights and fair judicial processes" by branding him as the mastermind behind the scandal.Malaysia's prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Low said his "professional connections" had helped Malaysia build strong ties with key allies, particularly Saudi Arabia, boosting Haj pilgrimage quotas for Malaysian Muslims and investments in financial, real estate and other sectors in the Southeast Asian country.Low declined to divulge his current location but confirmed he was offered asylum in August last year. He did not name the country offering asylum.In November, U.S. authorities struck a deal with Low to recoup $1 billion in funds allegedly looted from 1MDB, which included a private jet, high-end real estate in Beverly Hills, New York and London, and other assets.The deal does not include an admission of guilt or wrongdoing and is not tied to the criminal action against Low.Low - who said he has had "multiple brushes with cancer" - said he now plans to focus on investing in cutting-edge cancer research."I would cherish the opportunity to reinvigorate my philanthropic efforts and to give back to the community and help others in any way I can."(Reporting by Joseph Sipalan; Editing by Michael Perry)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMalay rulers to meet as Malaysia's political tumult deepensAssociated PressU.S. Moves to Raise Fees for Deportation Appeals by Nearly NinefoldThe Wall Street JournalAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Jesus Would Be Maligned As ‘Radical’ By Today’s CongressHuffPostThe Atlantic Politics Daily: Bernie’s Big VulnerabilityThe AtlanticTrump Spends 45 Minutes With ‘Deep State’ Play Actors Amid Coronavirus MayhemThe Daily BeastRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
