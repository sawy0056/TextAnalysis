(MRMD:OTCQX) a leading multi-state cannabis and hemp operator focused on health and wellness, announced today that their Illinois dispensaries in Anna and Harrisburg saw a significant uptick in sales on the first day under new laws to legalize recreational use of cannabis throughout the state. In May 2019, the Illinois General Assembly passed the HB 1438 law legalizing recreational cannabis use and sale in the state for adults which became effective January 1, 2020. Illinois is the 11th state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana. Thirty-three states allow the sale of marijuana for medical use, which Illinois legalized in 2013. Industry analysts estimate the new legal market for recreational, or adult-use cannabis, could exceed $2 billion annually. This new market is in addition to a surging medical marijuana market, which, according to Illinois government sources nearly doubled in size and number of patients during 2019, exceeding $200 million and nearly 90,000, respectively.According to Marijuana Business Daily, the maximum number of adult-use dispensaries allowed in Illinois in 2020 is 185, or 1.5 retail stores per 100,000 residents. By comparison, Oregon currently has 15.7 recreational marijuana retailers per 100,000 residents. MariMed Inc. plans to open two additional Illinois dispensaries in the coming year.MariMed’s dispensaries in Anna and Harrisburg, which operate under the Thrive brand, saw customers waiting outside for hours before opening. MariMed worked hard prior to January 1st to prepare for expected demand by recreational users while ensuring valued medical customers would still receive the attention, service and access to products that they have come to expect.   It was positive to see demand appearing to be as high in rural areas as in the more concentrated and competitive urban areas of the state.According to Gorgi Naumovski, MariMed’s Director of Operations in Illinois, “The customers were thrilled to legally purchase recreational cannabis in Illinois for the first time. This was the single busiest day in over 3 years of operations with customer count more than 5 times that of a normal day. We are excited for the industry and what the future holds for the state of Illinois and MariMed.”During 2019, under MariMed management, revenue from sales to medical patients grew significantly. With the addition of recreational clientele, MariMed is expected to realize significant revenue growth in 2020 which will be reflected in MariMed’s reported financial results.MariMed CEO, Bob Fireman, noted that, “We are excited to see the response by the people of Illinois to the new law. Gorgi and his team led by Rosie Naumovski, worked diligently servicing our medical patients while preparing for the recreational launch in our two dispensaries.  They are in the process of developing two additional adult use dispensaries in Illinois allowed under our licenses.  They have been valuable advocates for the Illinois cannabis programs from their inception providing guidance to both state and local authorities. We are proud to have them as part of the MariMed team. With our consolidation on track, MariMed’s revenue from these licensed businesses will now be included in our financial results in 2020 which in turn, will generate greater long-term value for our shareholders.”About MariMed:MariMed Inc., a multi-state cannabis operator, is dedicated to improving the health and wellness of people through the use of cannabinoids and cannabis products.
