Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $69.22 in the previous session. Synaptics has gained 3.7% since the start of the year compared to the 1% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 1% return for the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 7, 2019, Synaptics reported EPS of $1.22 versus consensus estimate of $0.73.For the current fiscal year, Synaptics is expected to post earnings of $4 per share on $1.29 billion in revenues. This represents a 0% change in EPS on a -12.3% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.82 per share on $1.26 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -4.38% and -2.78%, respectively.Valuation MetricsSynaptics may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Synaptics has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 10.9X versus its peer group's average of 12.5X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Synaptics currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Synaptics meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Synaptics shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Synaptics Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Synaptics have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Ichor Holdings (ICHR), Tokyo Electron (TOELY), and Screen Holdings Co. (DINRF), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 25% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Synaptics, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
