The technology, which enables multiple Bluetooth devices to play audio in sync, is the result of a partnership between MultiLink LLC and Bay Area startup Wearhaus.Bluetooth has historically been designed for individuals listening in isolation. Monster's Music Share product line, developed in conjunction with Wearhaus, allows multiple listeners to enjoy the experience at the same time. "Headphones are, by design, isolating - you tune out the world, but you also tune out your friends. Until now there has never been a good way to listen to music or watch movies with friends in a public space," said Richie Zeng, co-founder and CEO of Wearhaus."This technology completely redefines how Bluetooth headphones can be used - air travel, fitness classes, family trips, and more. It creates entirely new avenues for social interaction," says Noel Lee, Head Monster and Owner of MultiLink.The Music Share app allows users to designate which headphones receive the same audio signal and allows for multiple music sources in the same area. "This partnership represents a huge opportunity to integrate this technology into a wide array of products. We're honored to be working with Noel Lee and the rest of the Monster team to drive new initiatives," said Chey Harmon, VP Brand Partnerships of Wearhaus."We have incorporated the MultiLink technology so that it doesn't impact the retail cost. We would like to see this technology incorporated across multiple brands to bring the benefits of Music Share to other headphone makers as well," said Noel Lee.Those interested in incorporating Music Share into their products should contact Noel Lee or come by the Monster booth at CES where this technology will be demonstrated.For more information about Monster, visit www.monsterstore.com.For more information about Wearhaus, visit www.wearhaus.com.About MonsterFor 40 years, Monster® has been a catalyst for innovation and big ideas.
