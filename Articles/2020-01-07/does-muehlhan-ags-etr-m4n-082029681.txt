We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Muehlhan AG's (ETR:M4N), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Based on the last twelve months, Muehlhan's P/E ratio is 11.24. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 8.9%. Check out our latest analysis for Muehlhan How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Muehlhan:P/E of 11.24 = €3.26 ÷ €0.29 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each €1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Muehlhan Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Muehlhan has a lower P/E than the average (12.2) in the construction industry classification.XTRA:M4N Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Muehlhan shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Muehlhan increased earnings per share by a whopping 28% last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 37%. I'd therefore be a little surprised if its P/E ratio was not relatively high.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Muehlhan's Balance SheetMuehlhan's net debt is 53% of its market cap. This is a reasonably significant level of debt -- all else being equal you'd expect a much lower P/E than if it had net cash.The Bottom Line On Muehlhan's P/E RatioMuehlhan has a P/E of 11.2. That's below the average in the DE market, which is 21.1. The company may have significant debt, but EPS growth was good last year. The low P/E ratio suggests current market expectations are muted, implying these levels of growth will not continue.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
