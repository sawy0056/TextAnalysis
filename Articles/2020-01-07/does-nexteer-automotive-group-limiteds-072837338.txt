This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally we will reflect on how common stockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of performance. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. Check out our latest analysis for Nexteer Automotive Group How Does Guibin Zhao's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, Nexteer Automotive Group Limited has a market capitalization of HK$17b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$1.2m over the year to December 2018. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at US$173k. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. When we examined a selection of companies with market caps ranging from US$1.0b to US$3.2b, we found the median CEO total compensation was US$564k.It would therefore appear that Nexteer Automotive Group Limited pays Guibin Zhao more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. A closer look at the performance of the underlying business will give us a better idea about whether the pay is particularly generous.You can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at Nexteer Automotive Group, below.SEHK:1316 CEO Compensation, January 6th 2020MoreIs Nexteer Automotive Group Limited Growing?Over the last three years Nexteer Automotive Group Limited has grown its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 8.7% per year (using a line of best fit).
