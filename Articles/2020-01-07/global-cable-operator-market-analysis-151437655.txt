The term multiple-system operator (MSO) refers to a network operator of multiple cable or direct-broadcast satellite television systems. We use the terminology Cable MSO in this report as MSOs are predominantly fixed connection providers that utilize fiber and largely cable for connectivity to homes and businesses. This category includes residential Internet, Voice over IP (VoIP), TV, and security services as well as a variety of business services. Cable MSOs such as Cox Communications have provided SMB services for a long time. With the advent of the Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) business model, many Cable MSOs have launched consumer wireless offerings as an MVNO. More recently, Cable MSO providers seek to leverage their assets to offer various Internet of Things (IoT) related applications and services. In terms of IoT related services, Cable MSO companies hold a key role in connected home applications and services including home automation. Service areas include home security (monitoring, access control, automated lighting, etc.), connected appliances (refrigerator, washer/drier, whole house vacuum, etc.), HVAC systems, irrigation systems, and entertainment including TV service, video on demand, and competition with Over-the-Top (OTT) service providers. One of the ways that Cable MSOs can differentiate themselves versus OTT providers is to become one themselves by leveraging Telecom APIs. In fact, there are a few good arguments for cable companies using the OTT model only for wireless service rather than a traditional MVNO model.On the business to business (B2B) front, traditional Cable MSOs have new competition from Google Fiber as well as other companies seeking to provide high-speed fixed network connectivity. Due to the commercial introduction of 5G, and more specifically 5G New Radio (5GNR), cable MSO providers will have new competition from wireless carriers for connectivity, especially for enterprise communications. More specifically, 5GNR uses millimeter-wave RF propagation, which enables both high capacity and low latency data transport as a competitive offering to fiber and cable.Select Report BenefitsMarket by connectivity including cable, fiber, satellite, and other wirelessMarket by market sector including residential, enterprise, industrial, and government servicesBusiness services market by type including small and medium business (SMB) and enterprise customersMarket by networking type including consumer wireless, cable modem, set-top box, WiFi router, and VoIP devicesMarket by business solutions including cloud hosting, device, and video management, converged cable access, and moreEnterprise market by industry verticals including finance, healthcare, education, hospitality, media and entertainment, and othersEnterprise service support including digital media and imaging, telemedicine, eLearning, grid computing, e-government, and moreCompanies Mentioned
