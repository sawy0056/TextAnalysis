Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Excelsior Capital Limited (ASX:ECL) share price is up 17% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. However, if you include the dividends then the return is market beating. Meanwhile, the last twelve months saw the share price rise 3.5%. View our latest analysis for Excelsior Capital To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Excelsior Capital actually saw its EPS drop 5.1% per year.The strong decline in earnings per share suggests the market isn't using EPS to judge the company. The falling EPS doesn't correlate with the climbing share price, so it's worth taking a look at other metrics.There's no sign of growing dividends, which might have explained the resilient share price. It could be that the revenue growth of 7.9% per year is viewed as evidence that Excelsior Capital is growing. Indeed, revenue growth, rather than EPS, might be the current focus of the business.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:ECL Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Excelsior Capital's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Excelsior Capital the TSR over the last 5 years was 91%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveExcelsior Capital shareholders are up 8.4% for the year (even including dividends) . Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 14% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing.
