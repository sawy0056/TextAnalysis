Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Desane Group Holdings Limited (ASX:DGH).What Is Insider Buying?It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. Check out our latest analysis for Desane Group Holdings Desane Group Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by MD, CEO & Executive Director Phil Montrone for AU$91k worth of shares, at about AU$1.45 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of AU$1.49 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future.
