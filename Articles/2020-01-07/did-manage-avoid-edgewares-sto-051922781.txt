But really big losses can really drag down an overall portfolio. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of Edgeware AB (publ) (STO:EDGE), who have seen the share price tank a massive 83% over a three year period. That'd be enough to cause even the strongest minds some disquiet. And over the last year the share price fell 57%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 21% in the last 90 days.We really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio. Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson. Check out our latest analysis for Edgeware Edgeware isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.In the last three years Edgeware saw its revenue shrink by 5.0% per year. That is not a good result. Having said that the 44% annualized share price decline highlights the risk of investing in unprofitable companies. We're generally averse to companies with declining revenues, but we're not alone in that. Don't let a share price decline ruin your calm. You make better decisions when you're calm.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).OM:EDGE Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at Edgeware's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveEdgeware shareholders are down 57% for the year, but the broader market is up 33%. Of course the long term matters more than the short term, and even great stocks will sometimes have a poor year. The three-year loss of 44% per year isn't as bad as the last twelve months, suggesting that the company has not been able to convince the market it has solved its problems.
