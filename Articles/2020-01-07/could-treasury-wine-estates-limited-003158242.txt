How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.Investors might not know much about Treasury Wine Estates's dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last eight years and offers a 2.5% yield. A low yield is generally a turn-off, but if the prospects for earnings growth were strong, investors might be pleasantly surprised by the long-term results. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ASX:TWE Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Treasury Wine Estates paid out 65% of its profit as dividends. A payout ratio above 50% generally implies a business is reaching maturity, although it is still possible to reinvest in the business or increase the dividend over time.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Treasury Wine Estates paid out 96% of its free cash flow last year, which we think is concerning if cash flows do not improve. While Treasury Wine Estates's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, free cash flow is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Treasury Wine Estates to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.We update our data on Treasury Wine Estates every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. The first recorded dividend for Treasury Wine Estates, in the last decade, was eight years ago. The company has been paying a stable dividend for a while now, which is great. However we'd prefer to see consistency for a few more years before giving it our full seal of approval. During the past eight-year period, the first annual payment was AU$0.06 in 2012, compared to AU$0.40 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 27% per year over this time.The dividend has been growing pretty quickly, which could be enough to get us interested even though the dividend history is relatively short. Further research may be warranted.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. It's good to see Treasury Wine Estates has been growing its earnings per share at 49% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share are sharply up, but we wonder if paying out more than half its earnings (leaving less for reinvestment) is an implicit signal that Treasury Wine Estates's growth will be slower in the future.Story continuesConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Treasury Wine Estates gets a pass on its dividend payout ratio, but it paid out virtually all of its cash flow as dividends. This may just be a one-off, but we'd keep an eye on this. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, although its dividend history is not as long as we'd like. Ultimately, Treasury Wine Estates comes up short on our dividend analysis. It's not that we think it is a bad company - just that there are likely more appealing dividend prospects out there on this analysis.Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
