Bringing on PowerPlant Ventures, with its deep experience in plant-centric food and beverage, complements our existing group of high-profile investors and partners and is an exciting endorsement of our brand, products, and growth trajectory," said Mark Olivieri, President of OWYN. "Collectively, we remain committed to providing consumers with great tasting protein drinks that provide the nutrition and sustainability benefits of being 100% plant-based. This investment comes at the right time as we further expand our go-to-market resources to capitalize on our rapid growth trajectory."OWYN's flagship plant-based protein beverages contain only all-natural ingredients and are free from the top eight allergens. The beverage line uses a proprietary blend of flax, pea protein, and pumpkin seed as a protein source instead of the whey protein typically used in protein drinks. OWYN drinks are shelf stable and have roughly 20 grams of protein, less than four grams of sugar, and under 180 calories per serving. OWYN currently offers its protein drinks in six flavors including Dark Chocolate, Cold Brew Coffee, Smooth Vanilla, Cookie N' Cream, Tumeric Golden Mylk, and Strawberry Banana, and recently expanded its line to include meal replacement shakes in Chocolate and Chai flavors. "OWYN brought much needed innovation to the protein beverage category, and its products clearly hit the spot for consumers looking for plant-based options with great flavors and clean ingredients," said Mark Rampolla, co-founder and partner at PowerPlant Ventures. "We are thrilled to partner with Mark and team to leverage their great work to date, accelerate growth, and help OWYN become one of the next great plant-based brands.""The OWYN team has done a fantastic job leading the industry as one of the fastest growing protein brands in the natural channel," said Jason Cohen and Leigh Feuerstein, Co-CEOs of Halen Brands. "We look forward to building on our partnership with the Clearlake, PowerPlant, and OWYN teams to further disrupt this category.""OWYN's success in evolving into a thought leader in functional, plant-based nutrition is another example of the value that Clearlake's partnership with Halen Brands can bring to promising better-for-you brands. We look forward to partnering with PowerPlant and Halen on the next phase of OWYN's evolution," said Arta Tabaee, Managing Director at Clearlake.  "When we initially invested in OWYN, we partnered with Halen Brands to implement the Clearlake O.P.S.® framework, including initiatives focused on recruiting a highly effective leadership team and world-class sales organization to quickly scale OWYN," added Sean Courtney of Clearlake. "We are confident that adding PowerPlant's expertise in plant-based food and beverage investing will only enhance OWYN's successful trajectory."Story continuesThe investment provides OWYN with additional capital to continue accelerating its growth as the company prepares to expand further into the conventional grocery channel next year.
