The e-commerce giant will also have a tie-up with Future Consumer Ltd., that makes consumer goods like packaged snacks and household cleaners.The deal deepens Amazon’s collaboration with Future Group as India’s 1.3 billion people become a prized catch for global retail giants who are effectively shut out of China. Walmart Inc. spent $16 billion to buy local e-commerce leader Flipkart Online Services Pvt. in 2018 while Amazon has already pledged $5.5 billion investment in the country.
