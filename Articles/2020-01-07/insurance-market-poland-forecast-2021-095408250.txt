It describes the present market structure and recent trends in the insurance market. It also provides short term estimates of the insurance premium for the years 2019-2021. Premium written in the non-life insurance segment in Poland jumped by 7% in 2018 and by 3% in H1 2019, and it is expected to top PLN 42 billion by year-end 2019. By contrast, the premium in the life segment continued to decline, falling by nearly 12% in 2018 and going down again by another 3% in 1H 2019.Recent years have been particularly challenging for life insurers as the regulatory developments and disclosure rules have changed the way life products are distributed. This led also to significant changes in market shares as less adaptive players lost a significant part of their business while more flexible players gained market share and reinforced their position. Increasing regulatory pressure has been also among triggers of the ongoing consolidation. After multiple M&A transactions recorded in 2018, there are already new deals upcoming with the recently speculated withdrawal of AXA. The ongoing consolidation in the insurance sector is for sure taking out some pressure from the market in terms of pricing and tariffs as well it is helping to increase the scale of operations for the survivors.Key Topics CoveredSlide 1: Executive Summary1.
