After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put American Outdoor Brands Corporation AOBC stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, American Outdoor Brands has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.26, as you can see in the chart below:View photos This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.19. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, American Outdoor Brands’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.View photos Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.35. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. View photosStory continues We should also point out that American Outdoor Brands has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.51, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for American Outdoor Brands stock in the near term too.    P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings. Right now, American Outdoor Brands has a P/S ratio of about 0.84. This is higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.49 right now.  Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. View photos If anything, AOBC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of overvalued trading—at least compared to historical norms. Broad Value Outlook In aggregate, American Outdoor Brands currently has a Zacks Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes American Outdoor Brands a solid choice for value investors.  What About the Stock Overall? Though American Outdoor Brands might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D. This gives AOBC a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>) Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current year has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction, while the full year 2020 estimate has seen one upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 9.5% in the past two months, while the full year 2020 estimate has increased by 11.5%.

A strong industry rank (among top 9% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #2 further instils our confidence.However, over the past two years, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Products industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:View photos So, value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
