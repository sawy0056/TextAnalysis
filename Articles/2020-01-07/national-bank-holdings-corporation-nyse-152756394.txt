Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether National Bank Holdings's current trading price of US$35.97 reflective of the actual value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at National Bank Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for National Bank Holdings Is National Bank Holdings still cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 8.00% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy National Bank Holdings today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $33.30, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because National Bank Holdings’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of National Bank Holdings look like?NYSE:NBHC Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 1.1% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for National Bank Holdings, at least in the short term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NBHC’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NBHC, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
