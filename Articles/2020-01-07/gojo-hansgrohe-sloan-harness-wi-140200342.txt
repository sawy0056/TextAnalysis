Wi-Charge will demonstrate its long-range wireless power system embedded in a GOJO PURELL® hand sanitizer dispenser, a Hansgrohe smart faucet, and a Sloan sensor flushometer, at CES booth #40337 located in the smart home area of the Sands Expo.Commercial bathrooms have numerous battery-operated devices: soap dispensers, touchless faucets, flush valves and more. These batteries provide an ongoing maintenance and service level concern, and their disposal can also be an environmental hazard. Wi-Charge long-range wireless power delivers continuous energy to those devices so that batteries never need to be replaced. Wireless power also opens the door to enhanced functionality to improve availability and efficiency.MoreSmart and touchless bathroom appliances need power to operate. They are also becoming power-hungry IoT devices -- connected to building management systems in commercial environments and to voice assistants in residential ones. Bathroom appliances can be fitted with batteries, but batteries provide only limited power, need frequent replacement, and their disposal creates environmental issues. Wires can deliver ample power, but carry major drawbacks: the location of outlets, the wet environment, and the expensive process of installing wires and then re-tiling the bathroom walls.With its unique, patented long-range wireless power technology, consumer safety certification, and the ability to deliver ample power to multiple devices, Wi-Charge is solving the demanding power challenges of next-generation bathroom appliances. Long-range wireless power from Wi-Charge is the alternative that facility managers are craving for. Additionally, long-range wireless power allows consumers to quickly upgrade their bathrooms to the latest smart technology while avoiding expensive renovations."Water and electricity don't mix, and thus long-range wireless power is a natural choice for delivering energy to smart bathroom appliances," said Victor Vaisleib, CEO of Wi-Charge. "We are excited to collaborate with these distinguished market leaders to reduce retrofit and maintenance costs and usher commercial and residential bathrooms into the future.""The commercial restroom of the future is technologically advanced -- with always-on, connected devices that lower maintenance costs and give customers a consistently great experience," said Jim Allen, President, and CEO of Sloan Valve. "Long-range wireless power from Wi-Charge will greatly simplify the installation, monitoring and maintenance of large-scale commercial restrooms.""Customers want hygiene stations that are always available. With long-range wireless power from Wi-Charge, we can ensure devices are continually operational even under high traffic use, without the risk of downtime," said Joe Kanfer, Venturer at GOJO Industries. "The ample power Wi-Charge provides gives us the ability to break through the capacity limits of batteries and bring powerful new IoT features to our customers.""Hansgrohe and Wi-Charge are collaborating to bring unique smart bathroom products to the market," said Markus Armbruster, VP IT & Digital at Hansgrohe. "Long-range wireless power is a critical component to smart-living products that engage the beauty of water without extensive bathroom renovation and re-tiling."If you are attending CES 2020, please stop by to see the integration of Wi-Charge with Sloan, Hansgrohe, and GOJO's in action at the Wi-Charge booth #40337 at the Sands Expo.
