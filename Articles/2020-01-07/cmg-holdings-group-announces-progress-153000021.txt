The company continues to believe these shares are significantly underpriced. As long as this situation persists, we will continue to exercise our ability to return shares to the Treasury. To date, the company has purchased over 6.4 million shares. CMG's CEO Glenn Laken said, "I believe the shares of CMGO represent a real value play for investors with a short- to medium-term time horizon. Accordingly, I have personally purchased 2.1 million shares in the open market."Laken added, "On Friday January 3rd, CMG filed an arbitration proceeding against our former auditors for gross malpractice. If CMG prevails with these claims, as we expect we will, the company has the potential to collect another significant judgement."In other news, Laken announced the extension of the tender offer for 38.5 million restricted shares for an additional 45 days, stating, "We mailed the initial offer during the holiday season and were disappointed with the percentage of responses. I have hired a mailing company to take care of the second iteration of this offer. Each offer letter has been registered and must be signed for. Each document can be tracked so we'll know they've been delivered. We will get a very accurate read on this shortly and I will report back."As tweeted earlier concerning the manipulation of CMGO shares, we have received an initial response from our attorneys. They discovered a pattern of manipulation they believe is being perpetrated by at least two shareholders of CMG. Manipulative selling depresses the price of the stock and is unlawful. Counsel has advised the appropriate market makers of this activity and has also issued Cease and Desist letters to the shareholders in question. This is the first revelatory information to come back; our attorneys are continuing to look at patterns and may have additional information in the near future. We intend to continue our efforts to protect the orderly market for our stock. If our efforts to end this behavior are not successful, we will not hesitate to take the issue to the next level and will keep shareholders apprised.Laken added, "CMG's subsidiary XA has a number of meetings set up for the first few weeks of this month with established clients and a number of potential new ones. XA will begin to schedule work for the first two quarters of the year shortly. Once we have a solid handle on XA revenue going forward I will share that with shareholders as well."About CMG Holdings Group, Inc.CMG Holdings Group, Inc. is a Chicago holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is XA – The Experiential Agency, Inc.
