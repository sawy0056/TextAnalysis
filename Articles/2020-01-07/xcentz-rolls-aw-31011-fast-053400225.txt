Based on increasing demand among consumers for products that can be recharged quickly among an expanding range of application scenarios, Xcentz has developed the AW-31011, the 45W PD charger that is compatible with the broadest range of devices, from low-powered mobile phones and tablets to power-hungry notebooks and laptops. With a unique appearance, a slip-resistant diagonal design and folding pins, the charger, which comes in several fashionable colors, takes up minimal space in the user's pocket or carrying case.Xcentz 45W USB C PD Wall ChargerMore"Xcentz is committed to creating products which combine leading tech and optimum usability," said Kevin Luo, Director of Product Research and Development at Xcentz. "The challenge facing the new PD charging protocol is the ability to provide fast charging across all brands and devices. Despite claims over the speed devices can be recharged, most currently available chargers fail to live up to the hype and offer an inferior experience. In response, we have expanded our R&D efforts, and repeatedly adjusted and improved our 45W PD charger by testing it with more than 100 popular products, models and brands to ensure users an enhanced fast-charge experience."Highlighted features of the AW-31011: Faster charging: Combined with a USB-C to USB-C Cable, the AW-31011 can quickly charge a Samsung Note 10+ to 70 percent in 30 minutes, while combined with a USB-C to Lightning Cable, an iPhone XR can be charged to 50 percent in 30 minutes.
