Pennsylvania has one of the highest opioid overdose death rates in the nation. Every day, thousands of Pennsylvanians—mothers, and fathers, children, neighbors—struggle to overcome addiction. Rural and urban, rich and poor, the opioid crisis affects all of us.Neither people nor communities can fight this battle alone. Public media has a unique potential to connect Pennsylvanians across boundaries, and, in an unprecedented collaboration, we are doing just that. Our local reporting and programming have covered the opioid crisis for years—but now we are uniting to show you how Pennsylvanians statewide are confronting the epidemic of heroin and prescription opioid abuse. We are increasing awareness and empathy to reduce the stigma around opioid use, aid prevention, and help people find treatment.Pennsylvania Public Media stations WHYY (Philadelphia), WITF (Harrisburg), WLVT/PBS39 (Greater Lehigh Valley), WPSU (State College), WQED (Pittsburgh), WQLN (Northwestern Pennsylvania), and VIA Public Media (Northeastern Pennsylvania) are collaborating to produce educational programming that focuses on the opioid crisis and its impact.To listen to the Battling Opioids Podcast, visit battlingopioids.org/podcasts.Contact: Jim Donnelly/570.602.1145/jimdonnelly@wvia.orgRelated FilesBattling Opioids Part 4 Press Release Jan. 2020.pdfRelated LinksBattling Opioids CisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvania-public-medias-battling-opioids-television-series-addresses-current-and-new-treatments-in-part-four-300981268.htmlSOURCE Battling OpioidsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe Opioid Epidemic Might Be Much Worse Than We ThoughtThe AtlanticReview:
