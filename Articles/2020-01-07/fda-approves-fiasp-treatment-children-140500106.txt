"Children can be unpredictable and having the option of a fast-acting insulin that doesn't require pre-meal dosing like Fiasp® is a welcome development for the diabetes community."The approval is based on the FDA's review of data from the onset 7 clinical trial, which confirmed the efficacy and safety of Fiasp® in children. 7For information on cost and savings offers, including co-pay and patient assistance programs, visit myfiaspcost.com.About Fiasp®Fiasp® is the first and only fast-acting mealtime insulin injection that does not have a pre-meal dosing recommendation.
