But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) share price has soared 183% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Check out our latest analysis for Live Nation Entertainment We don't think that Live Nation Entertainment's modest trailing twelve month profit has the market's full attention at the moment. We think revenue is probably a better guide. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. For shareholders to have confidence a company will grow profits significantly, it must grow revenue.For the last half decade, Live Nation Entertainment can boast revenue growth at a rate of 12% per year. That's a pretty good long term growth rate. We'd argue this growth has been reflected in the share price which has climbed at a rate of 23% per year over in that time. It's well worth monitoring the growth trend in revenue, because if growth accelerates, that might signal an opportunity. Accelerating growth can be a sign of an inflection point - and could indicate profits lie ahead.
