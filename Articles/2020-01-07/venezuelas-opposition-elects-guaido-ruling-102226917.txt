The move by Guaidó was then backed by many countries, including the U.S. and U.K.Despite several attempts through the year, however, President Maduro has managed to cling to power, mainly with support from the military and the backing of China, Russia, and Cuba.U.S. ReactionThe United States condemned the move by Venezuela's ruling party to seize Congress and congratulated Guaido for winning a second term.“Venezuela’s political parties came together in a resounding display of unity to support Juan Guaido’s re-election,” said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday night“No regime thugs, no jail cells, and no bribery or intimidation can subvert the will of the Venezuelan people,” added Pompeo.0See more from BenzingaFujifilm To Terminate Sales Partnership With Xerox In 2021Sony To Develop New Vision Sensor For Self-Driving VehiclesChip Market Could Rebound In 2020: Nintendo And Apple Chip Maker© 2020 Benzinga.com.
