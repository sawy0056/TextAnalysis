It's particularly important to make sure puppies are receiving the proper nutritional ingredients that build a healthy foundation, and that focus is missing in virtually all raw dog food companies."As with all Cali Raw formulas, the new Turkey & Lamb Puppy Formula is made in a local USDA inspected facility with locally sourced, certified humane meats. Focused on formulas that are high in healthy fats, low in carbs and complete with fresh, locally grown vegetables, Cali Raw ensures dogs receive all the essential nutrients they need to thrive."Cali Raw is an innovator in raw formulas, for both adults & puppies. We are very excited to expand our line of food, bones, treats & supplements in 2020." said James Pendergast, Cali Raw's Animal Diet Formulator. "Our Wild Alaskan sock-eye salmon oil -- featured in all of Cali Raw Formulas and available separately for supplementing-- contributes to optimal brain and eye development as well as a stronger immune system for young dogs."Cali Raw has also expanded its line of recreational raw dog bones. Their raw dog bones are designed for all different sizes of dogs, including Small & Medium, Medium & Large, and Large & Extra-Large breeds.
