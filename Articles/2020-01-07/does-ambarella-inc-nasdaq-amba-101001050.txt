(NASDAQ:AMBA) Have A Volatile Share Price?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosAnyone researching Ambarella, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMBA) might want to consider the historical volatility of the share price. Volatility is considered to be a measure of risk in modern finance theory. Investors may think of volatility as falling into two main categories. First, we have company specific volatility, which is the price gyrations of an individual stock. Holding at least 8 stocks can reduce this kind of risk across a portfolio. The other type, which cannot be diversified away, is the volatility of the entire market. Every stock in the market is exposed to this volatility, which is linked to the fact that stocks prices are correlated in an efficient market.Some stocks mimic the volatility of the market quite closely, while others demonstrate muted, exagerrated or uncorrelated price movements. Beta is a widely used metric to measure a stock's exposure to market risk (volatility). Before we go on, it's worth noting that Warren Buffett pointed out in his 2014 letter to shareholders that 'volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' Having said that, beta can still be rather useful. The first thing to understand about beta is that the beta of the overall market is one. Any stock with a beta of greater than one is considered more volatile than the market, while those with a beta below one are either less volatile or poorly correlated with the market. See our latest analysis for Ambarella What does AMBA's beta value mean to investors?Zooming in on Ambarella, we see it has a five year beta of 1.20. This is above 1, so historically its share price has been influenced by the broader volatility of the stock market. If this beta value holds true in the future, Ambarella shares are likely to rise more than the market when the market is going up, but fall faster when the market is going down. Beta is worth considering, but it's also important to consider whether Ambarella is growing earnings and revenue. You can take a look for yourself, below.NasdaqGS:AMBA Income Statement, January 6th 2020MoreCould AMBA's size cause it to be more volatile?Ambarella is a fairly large company. It has a market capitalisation of US$2.1b, which means it is probably on the radar of most investors. It has a relatively high beta, suggesting it may be somehow leveraged to macroeconomic conditions. For example, it might be a high growth stock with lots of investors trading the shares. It's notable when large companies to have high beta values, because it usually takes substantial capital flows to move their share prices.What this means for you:Beta only tells us that the Ambarella share price is sensitive to broader market movements. This could indicate that it is a high growth company, or is heavily influenced by sentiment because it is speculative. Alternatively, it could have operating leverage in its business model. Ultimately, beta is an interesting metric, but there's plenty more to learn.
