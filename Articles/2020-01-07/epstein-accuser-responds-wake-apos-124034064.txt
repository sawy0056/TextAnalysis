His determination hinged on two bone fractures in Epstein's larynx, in the area of the Adam’s apple, and a third break on the bone above the Adam’s apple.“Those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,” Baden said during the segment. “I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case.”CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSEpstein, who was previously convicted of prostituting an underage girl, was charged in July with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy, but the criminal case was dismissed following his death.He was reportedly worth more than $550 million and owned properties in New York City, New Mexico, West Palm Beach, France and on the U.S. Virgin Islands.HERE'S EVERYTHING JEFFREY EPSTEIN OWNED WITH HIS $577M FORTUNEExecutors for Epstein’s estate later announced plans for a victims' compensation fund to be established.Though the criminal case against Epstein was dismissed following his death, authorities are still investigating potential co-conspirators and associates, such as British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. Several accusers have filed civil lawsuits against the financier's estate.EPSTEIN PAL GHISLAINE MAXWELL UNDER EX-SPECIAL FORCES GUARD: REPORTOne of the images shared during the "60 Minutes" segment showed a note Epstein allegedly left behind, which listed complains he had against the jail staff.In November, the jail guards tasked with overseeing the multimillionaire's jail cell around the time of his death were arrested pursuant to a grand jury indictment.Tova Noel and Michael Thomas were accused of neglecting their duties by failing to perform checks on Epstein every half hour, as required, and of fabricating log entries to show they had, according to officials and court records.The guards, who were reportedly working overtime because of staffing shortages when Epstein's body was found, were placed on administrative leave while the FBI and the Justice Department's Inspector General continue to investigate."Any allegations of misconduct are taken very seriously by the agency and will be responded to appropriately," Bureau of Prisons director Kathleen Hawk Sawyer said in a statement at the time of the arrests. "I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public's trust in us."BILL GATES CALLS JEFFREY EPSTEIN MEETING 'A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT'Related ArticlesHow Much is Michael Phelps Worth?Here's How You Get a Body Like An OlympianFmr.
