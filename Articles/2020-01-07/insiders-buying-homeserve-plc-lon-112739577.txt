Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in HomeServe plc (LON:HSV).What Is Insider Selling?Most investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise. Check out our latest analysis for HomeServe HomeServe Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Stella David for UK£325k worth of shares, at about UK£11.45 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of UK£12.85. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the HomeServe insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Stella David.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that HomeServe insiders own 13% of the company, worth about UK£546m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The HomeServe Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded HomeServe shares in the last quarter. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like HomeServe insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future.
