But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. For example, the Aritzia Inc. (TSE:ATZ) share price is up 22% in the last year, clearly besting the market return of around 13% (not including dividends). So that should have shareholders smiling. However, the longer term returns haven't been so impressive, with the stock up just 9.9% in the last three years. See our latest analysis for Aritzia To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last year Aritzia grew its earnings per share (EPS) by 20%. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 22% increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time.
