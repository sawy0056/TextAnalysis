We'll show how you can use Next Fifteen Communications Group plc's (LON:NFC) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Based on the last twelve months, Next Fifteen Communications Group's P/E ratio is 59.97. That means that at current prices, buyers pay £59.97 for every £1 in trailing yearly profits. Check out our latest analysis for Next Fifteen Communications Group How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Next Fifteen Communications Group:P/E of 59.97 = £5.40 ÷ £0.09 (Based on the year to July 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Next Fifteen Communications Group Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (23.3) for companies in the media industry is lower than Next Fifteen Communications Group's P/E.AIM:NFC Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreNext Fifteen Communications Group's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Next Fifteen Communications Group's earnings per share fell by 45% in the last twelve months. But it has grown its earnings per share by 18% per year over the last three years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does Next Fifteen Communications Group's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals just 0.8% of Next Fifteen Communications Group's market cap. It would probably trade on a higher P/E ratio if it had a lot of cash, but I doubt it is having a big impact.The Bottom Line On Next Fifteen Communications Group's P/E RatioNext Fifteen Communications Group's P/E is 60.0 which suggests the market is more focussed on the future opportunity rather than the current level of earnings. With some debt but no EPS growth last year, the market has high expectations of future profits.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
