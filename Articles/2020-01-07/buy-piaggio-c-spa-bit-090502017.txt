SpA (BIT:PIA)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 6, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosPiaggio & C. SpA (BIT:PIA), which is in the auto business, and is based in Italy, received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the BIT over the last few months, increasing to €3.09 at one point, and dropping to the lows of €2.60. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price.

Check out our latest analysis for Piaggio & C What's the opportunity in Piaggio & C?Good news, investors! Piaggio & C is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is €4.53, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Piaggio & C’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What does the future of Piaggio & C look like?BIT:PIA Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
