Even the cyclic decline of the overall automotive industry has a relatively less impact on the overall demand for SBW systems, the growth is protected by an incessant shift from mechanical transmission systems to SBW systems.Market HighlightsThe automotive SBW systems market is projected to offer healthy growth opportunities and is likely to reach US$ 2,139.5 million in 2030. Organic growth in vehicle production, growing penetration of automatic transmission vehicles in the overall vehicle production, the emergence of electric vehicles, and significant weight reduction along with an improvement in fuel economy with SBW systems are some of the major factors that are fueling the growth of the SBW systems market.The author has firstly segmented the market based on the vehicle type as hatchback, sedan, SUV, and others. SUV is expected to remain the largest market segment in the years to come, propelled by the trend of the shift from sedans and hatchbacks towards SUVs. Spacious interiors and comfortable and satisfying driving experience have generated a sheer interest for SUVs among consumers. Further, there is also a slightly higher penetration of SBWs in SUVs over other vehicle types.Our analysis on another market segmentation, which is based on the powertrain type, suggests that combustion vehicle is forecasted to remain the larger consumer of SBW systems in the near future. On the contrary, electric vehicles are likely to exhibit faster growth during the same period. Various prominent EV models, such as Nissan Leaf, BMW i3, Toyota Pirus, and Audi e-Tron, are equipped with SBW systems. Analogously, the study's outcomes on different design types advocate that joystick is the most preferred design of SBW among Joystick, rotary, lever, buttons, and others, in years to come. Rotatory is another key segment that holds a considerable share and is likely to exhibit the highest growth in the near future. Some of the key vehicle models that are equipped with rotary SBW systems include Land Rover Discovery, Jaguar XE, and Chrysler Pacifica.In terms of regions, Europe is so far the largest automotive SBW systems market propelled by early adoption of SBW systems by the region's leading automakers such as BMW AG, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen AG, and Groupe Renault. On the other hand, Asia-Pacific likely to witness the highest growth during the forecast period. China is the growth engine of the Asia-Pacific's market, propelled by increasing adoption of SBW systems by the leading Chinese OEMs such as FAW, Changan Automobile, Geely, and GWM (Great Wall Motors) in some of their vehicle models.The supply chain of this market comprises raw material suppliers, components manufacturers, SBW systems manufacturers, and automotive OEMs. The key SBW systems manufacturers are ZF Group, Kongsberg automotive, Ficosa International SA, KOSTAL Group, GHSP Inc., Kuster holding, Atsumetic Co. Ltd., Dura Automotive Systems, Sila Group, Tokai Rika Co. Ltd., Eissmann Group Automotive, and JOPP Group. New product development, advancements in automotive SBW systems' functionality, and collaboration with OEMs are the key strategies adopted by the major players to gain a competitive edge in the marketKey Topics Covered1.
