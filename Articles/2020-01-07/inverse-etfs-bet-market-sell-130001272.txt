The U.S. move followed a New Year Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad (read: Iraq Attack: Sector ETF Winners and Losers).Investors should note that the United States’ sanctions against Iran were put into place in August 2018. The sanctions were on cars, metals and minerals as well as U.S. and European aircraft. The second part of the sanctions that bans import of Iranian energy was enacted in November 2018.The result of the U.S. air strike and the killing of Iranian commander was Iraq’s demand for an expulsion of all foreign troops and Iran’s pulling back from the 2015 nuclear deal. Strategists expect the U.S.-Iran tensions to flare up in the medium term.Germany called for “crisis meeting of EU foreign ministers” over Middle-East tension.
