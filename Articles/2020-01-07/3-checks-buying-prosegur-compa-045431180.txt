See our latest analysis for Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad paid out 101% of its earnings, which is more than we're comfortable with, unless there are mitigating circumstances. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 128%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad's payouts were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.BME:PSG Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MoreHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad's 14% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, ten years ago, Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad has lifted its dividend by approximately 21% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad is already paying out 101% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.To Sum It UpHas Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Not only are earnings per share declining, but Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of both its earnings and cashflow to shareholders as dividends. This is a clearly suboptimal combination that usually suggests the dividend is at risk of being cut. If not now, then perhaps in the future. It's not that we think Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.Story continuesCurious what other investors think of Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad?
