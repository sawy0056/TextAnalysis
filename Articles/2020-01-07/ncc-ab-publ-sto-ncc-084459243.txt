On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.A slim 2.6% yield is hard to get excited about, but the long payment history is respectable. At the right price, or with strong growth opportunities, NCC could have potential. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying NCC for its dividend - read on to learn more. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on NCC! OM:NCC B Historical Dividend Yield, January 6th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. NCC paid out 71% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Unfortunately, while NCC pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.Is NCC's Balance Sheet Risky?As NCC has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 2.03 times its EBITDA, NCC's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. NCC has EBIT of 8.00 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of NCC's latest financial position,

NCC has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. Its most recent annual dividend was kr4.00 per share, effectively flat on its first payment ten years ago.We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments, we don't think this is an attractive combination.Story continuesDividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. NCC's earnings per share have shrunk at 21% a year over the past five years. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and NCC's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that NCC's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we think NCC has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. Earnings per share have been falling, and the company has cut its dividend at least once in the past. From a dividend perspective, this is a cause for concern. Using these criteria, NCC looks quite suboptimal from a dividend investment perspective.Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company.We have also put together a list of global stocks with a market capitalisation above $1bn and yielding more 3%.
