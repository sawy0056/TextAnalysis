Guarnero toll free at (877) 779-1414 or MGuarnero@bernlieb.com.The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Mylan's Morgantown facility was in significant violation of the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations; (2) Mylan would need to engage in a massive restructuring and remediation program; (3) Mylan's North American Segment would be substantially impacted by said program, which would in turn materially impact Mylan's financial health; (3) Mylan lacked effective internal control over financial reporting; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, the Company's financial statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.The truth began to emerge with a series of disclosures (and subsequent stock drops) beginning on August 8, 2018. Finally, on May 7, 2019, before the market opened, Mylan issued a press release announcing the Company's financial and operating results for the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019. The press release disclosed, among other information, that "North America segment net sales ... [were] down 6% on an actual and constant currency basis, primarily driven by changes in the competitive environment and the impact of the Morgantown plant remediation activities."On this news, the price of the Company's common stock declined $6.73, from a close on May 6, 2019 of $28.26 per share, to a close on May 7, 2019 of $21.53 per share, a drop of approximately 23.81 percent.If you purchased MYL securities, and/or would like to discuss your legal rights and options please visit https://www.bernlieb.com/cases/mylannv-myl-shareholder-class-action-lawsuit-stock-fraud-234/apply contact Matthew E.
