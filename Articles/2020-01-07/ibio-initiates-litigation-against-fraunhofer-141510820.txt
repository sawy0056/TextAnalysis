(NYSE AMERICAN:IBIO) (“iBio”), a biologics innovator and contract manufacturer, announced today that it filed a motion in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware to initiate new litigation against Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (“Fraunhofer”) through an amended complaint. The new motion asserts that depositions conducted in late 2019 of personnel of Fraunhofer and its U.S. unit, Fraunhofer USA, Inc. (“FhUSA”), revealed that Fraunhofer exercised complete dominion and control over FhUSA to wrongfully access and direct use of iBio’s intellectual property on many occasions with new and different third parties. The motion seeks to amend the complaint filed in March of 2015 against FhUSA on the basis that Fraunhofer executives engaged in a pressure campaign to gain access to iBio’s intellectual property by sending Fraunhofer’s scientists to FhUSA in 2015 and 2016, requiring disclosure by FhUSA to Fraunhofer of iBio’s confidential intellectual property and otherwise flouting the court’s 2016 decision that all of the intellectual property in the plant area developed or acquired by FhUSA from 2003 through 2014 is owned exclusively by iBio. Robert B. Kay, iBio’s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “iBio will continue to vigorously protect its intellectual property and pursue justice through the courts to assure that iBio is fully compensated for the substantial damage caused by Fraunhofer’s wrongful conduct.”Kirkland & Ellis LLP represents iBio in the litigation along with lawyers at Ross Aronstam & Moritz LLP.About iBioiBio, Inc., is a global leader in plant-based biologics manufacturing.
