Refurbishment of the plant is complete, and the ramp-up of commissioning activities has resulted in early production of nickel concentrate. The Company has produced over 11,000 dmt to date and is set to deliver its first shipment in January of 2020.On the back of strong commercial interest, the Company has looked to establish relationships with a diverse set of offtake partners, each with strong reputations globally. In line with this strategy, Atlantic Nickel is pleased to announce that it has entered into a three-year offtake contract for a portion of Santa Rita's production and a US$40.8m financing arrangement with Trafigura. The deal provides the remaining funding required for the restart of the project and establishes a strong relationship with a best-in-class global commodities trading firm.The quick, safe, and capital efficient restart has been, and will continue to be, driven by high-calibre execution from the team on the ground in Bahia, delivering on a revised operating strategy developed and implemented jointly by Atlantic Nickel's leading management team and Appian, and maintaining the excellent existing infrastructure at site.Following the announcement of recent drilling results (link provided here), an updated open pit reserve statement is planned for completion in Q1 2020 and the Company expects to undertake further drilling in 2020 to continue to grow and define the long life underground resource potential. Paulo Castellari , CEO Atlantic Nickel & Appian Brazil commented:"I am delighted to announce the official re-start and first sale from Santa Rita. This important milestone for both Atlantic Nickel and Appian demonstrates the technical excellence of our team who have brought the project back to production ahead of schedule in a safe and responsible manner. The team and I am now looking forward to bringing the asset to full capacity.Following our updated mineral resource estimate, Santa Rita is an asset with significant upside, with the potential for further expansion both underground and through an open pit satellite resource. Today's announcement further de-risks the project and I remain confident in Santa Rita's prospects as a low-cost, long-life mine that is well positioned to benefit from the growth in electric vehicles to generate strong investor returns".About Appian Appian Capital Advisory LLP is the investment advisor to the Appian Natural Resources Fund LP and the Appian Natural Resources Fund II LP, long-term value focused private equity funds that invest solely in mining and mining related companies.
