Events are independently planned by schools, homeschool groups, community organizations, and individuals.School choice -- the process of parents actively choosing traditional public schools, public charter schools, public magnet schools, private schools, online schools, or homeschooling for their children -- is more common than ever before. According to recent data, one third of American families actively choose the schools their children attend."Every child is unique, and parents want their children to learn and succeed in schools that inspire and motivate them," said Andrew Campanella, president of National School Choice Week. "During National School Choice Week, we invite all Americans to learn more about school choice and to join us in shining a positive spotlight on effective education options for children."This January will mark the tenth anniversary of National School Choice Week, which began in 2011 with 150 events held around the country. The week is nonpartisan and nonpolitical, and does not seek to promote the passage or defeat of legislation.More information and resources for journalists covering the Week can be found at schoolchoiceweek.com.
