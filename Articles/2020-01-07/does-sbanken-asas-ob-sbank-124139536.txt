We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Sbanken ASA's (OB:SBANK), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Sbanken has a P/E ratio of 11.67. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 8.6%. See our latest analysis for Sbanken How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Sbanken:P/E of 11.67 = NOK75.00 ÷ NOK6.43 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Sbanken's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Sbanken has a higher P/E than the average (8.6) P/E for companies in the banks industry.OB:SBANK Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 6th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Sbanken will outperform other companies in its industry. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Sbanken shrunk earnings per share by 2.3% last year. And over the longer term (3 years) earnings per share have decreased 2.1% annually. So we might expect a relatively low P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Sbanken's Balance SheetNet debt totals a substantial 267% of Sbanken's market cap. This level of debt justifies a relatively low P/E, so remain cognizant of the debt, if you're comparing it to other stocks.The Verdict On Sbanken's P/E RatioSbanken trades on a P/E ratio of 11.7, which is below the NO market average of 14.5. Given meaningful debt, and a lack of recent growth, the market looks to be extrapolating this recent performance; reflecting low expectations for the future.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
