MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Google has pulled off two major deals so far this year. Two weeks ago, the company announced it's paying $3.2 billion for Nest Labs, a Silicon Valley startup that makes high-tech thermostats and smoke detectors that can communicate with each other and learn homeowners' habits. Then, on Wednesday, Google Inc. unveiled a $2.9 billion agreement to sell its Motorola Mobility smartphone business to Lenovo Group Ltd.Most analysts never understood why Google paid $12.4 billion for Motorola Mobility in May 2012. But they seem more intrigued about Google's plans for Nest Labs, which was started in 2010 by two former Apple Inc. engineers, Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers.Google CEO Larry Page wasn't on hand to field analyst questions Thursday during the company's fourth-quarter conference call because he had previously decided he no longer wanted to spend his time participating in the sessions every three months. That left it to Patrick Pichette, Google's chief financial officer, to explain why the company wants Nest's brand and technology.QUESTION: You didn't talk much about Nest, and so we were curious whether you are primarily interested their design team or product or something else?ANSWER: Nest and Google share a real common vision .... Both of us believe that technology should be doing the hard work so that people can get on with their lives and do great things. So our goal really in the case of Nest is to help them scale, right? And bringing the resources of Google to increase their investments, reach broader audiences and then scale internationally. So, for us, it's a terrific opportunity. And, then ... to attract people like Tony and Matt to the team is actually wonderful.
