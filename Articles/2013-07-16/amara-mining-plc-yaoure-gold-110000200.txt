LONDON--(Marketwired - Jul 16, 2013) -16 July 2013 AIM:AMA / TSX:AMZ Amara Mining plc ("Amara" or "the Company") RESULTS OF METALLURGICAL TESTWORK AND FURTHER DRILLING RESULTS FROM YAOURE GOLD PROJECT Amara Mining plc, the dual AIM and TSX-listed West African focused gold mining company, is pleased to announce the results of the second phase of its metallurgical testwork programme and the latest drilling results from the Yaoure Gold Project ("Yaoure") in Cote d'Ivoire.    HIGHLIGHTS * Yaoure mineralisation is simple and non-refractory, demonstrating strong recoveries * Two potential processing routes have been identified: whole ore leach through traditional carbon-in-leach ("CIL") / carbon-in-pulp ("CIP") and froth flotation * Work has commenced to refine both processing routes in advance of the release of the Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") * Hydro-electric power ("HEP") is available at Yaoure and work will be undertaken to optimise both processing routes on the basis of cheap, readily available power * In-fill drilling completed and assays continue to generate encouraging results - a further Mineral Resource update is expected to be released in Q4 2013, along with the PEA Peter Spivey, Chief Executive Officer, commented:"We are encouraged by the results of the metallurgical testwork which further confirm the potential Yaoure has to become a highly economic mine. In the next few months we will further refine our testwork to evaluate the optimal processing route for Yaoure, weighing the benefits of strong recoveries against the necessity for low capex and opex. Yaoure is one of the most ideally located projects in West Africa, with excellent infrastructure including a HEP station 5km from site. The simple, non-refractory mineralisation adds further strength to the potential of the project and the investment case. We have largely completed our current phase of investment into Yaoure and are now focused on the delivery of a PEA in Q4 2013 to further demonstrate the project's robust economics."
