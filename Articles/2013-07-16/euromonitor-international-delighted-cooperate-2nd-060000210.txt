LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - Jul 16, 2013) -
Probiotics remain one of the most successful functional food ingredients. In fact, adding new sales of US$2.2 billion in 2012 alone, probiotic yoghurt is the second largest growing fortified/functional food across the world. Yet, Euromonitor's surveys show that the awareness of probiotics is much higher than the detailed knowledge of what probiotics are or frequent consumption.Committed to in-depth reporting on the developments within healthy nutrition, Euromonitor International is delighted to be a part of the second episode of the pioneering Probiotic "Microwarriors Film Series", Titled: "Microwarriors: The Origin and the Destiny.""Microwarriors" can greatly contribute to increasing consumer education and support the global quest for maximising health and wellbeing through affordable nutrition," said Ewa Hudson, Global Head of Health and Wellness Research at Euromonitor International.Notes to editors:Euromonitor International: Passport Health and Wellness Publications"Probiotics: 2011 the Year of Brazil, China and the US" Mar 2012"Probiotics and Prebiotics: Moving Beyond Digestive Health - Opportunities and Challenges" Dec 2010"Global Probiotics and Prebiotics: Moving Beyond Digestive Health Status Quo" Oct 2010For further information about Euromonitor's research, please contact the press office.For further information on participating/supporting the "Microwarriors Film Series", please contact David Knight at microwarriorsmovie@sbcglobal.net or visit www.microwarriorsmovie.com.About Passport Health and WellnessPassport: Health and Wellness is the leading online market intelligence system for strategic, corporate and marketing planning.
