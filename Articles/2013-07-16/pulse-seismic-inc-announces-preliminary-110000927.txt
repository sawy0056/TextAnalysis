CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Jul 16, 2013) -
Pulse Seismic Inc. ("Pulse" or "the Company") (PSD.TO) (PLSDF) announces preliminary selected unaudited financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.These financial results are based upon management's estimates and have not yet been approved by the Company's Audit Committee or Board of Directors or reviewed by the Company's auditors.Pulse expects to release its full financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 on August 2, 2013.Pulse's key performance metrics, which include cash EBITDA(a), shareholder free cash flow(a) and net earnings, all declined in the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 from the prior year's comparative periods. Following quarterly records achieved in the first two quarters of 2012, lower data library sales were experienced in both the first and second quarters of 2013, accounting for the weaker results."Seismic data library sales have innately poor visibility, being influenced by a number of industry drivers and ultimately depending on capital spending decisions by individual energy producers," stated Neal Coleman, Pulse's President and CEO. "We are currently seeing fewer of the asset and corporate transaction-based sales of seismic data that contributed to last year's record results."Pulse continues to benefit from its low cost structure and strong financial position, Coleman commented, which includes period-end debt of only 1.5 times its first-half 2013 cash EBITDA. Low costs enabled Pulse to continue delivering positive cash EBITDA and shareholder free cash flow in the first half of 2013, as well as to make significant debt repayments.HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2013Seismic data library sales for the second quarter of 2013 were $4.5 million compared to $13.5 million for the comparable period in 2012. Seismic data library sales for the six months ended June 30, 2013 were $18.4 million compared to $48.1 million for the first half of 2012. Total seismic revenue (including revenue from participation surveys) was $4.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and $31.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $13.5 million and $49.9 million for the respective periods in 2012. Cash EBITDA was $2.3 million ($0.04 per share basic and diluted) for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $10.9 million ($0.17 per share basic and diluted) for the comparable period in 2012. Cash EBITDA was $13.6 million ($0.22 per share basic and diluted) for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $43.0 million ($0.67 per share basic and diluted) for the six months ended June 30, 2012.
Shareholder free cash flow was $3.4 million ($0.06 per share basic and diluted) for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $10.4 million ($0.17 per share basic and diluted) for the comparable period in 2012. Shareholder free cash flow was $13.8 million ($0.23 per share basic and diluted) for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to $41.8 million ($0.65 per share basic and diluted) for the first half of 2012.
A net loss of $15.1 million (including non-cash amortization expense of $22.3 million) was incurred in the second quarter of 2013, bringing the net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $12.5 million (including non-cash amortization expense of $42.3 million). Net earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $1.9 million (including non-cash amortization expense of $6.8 million) and for the six months ended June 30, 2012 were $13.9 million (including non-cash amortization expense of $23.8 million). Pulse's high level of participation survey activity accounted for the higher non-cash amortization in the current period, contributing approximately $29.0 million in amortization expense in the first half of the year.
The 2012/13 winter 3D participation survey program was completed on-time and on-budget during the second quarter. The three surveys totalled 1,182 square kilometres, with total gross capital expenditures amounting to $57.9 million. The 540 square kilometre McKinley 3D survey had been completed and delivered in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, two of the three surveys, the Fox Creek and Pembina 3D surveys, totalling 642 square kilometres, were in the final stages of processing. Processing was completed in the second quarter, the data was delivered to the client and the costs were moved from participation surveys in progress to the seismic data library. In the second quarter Pulse purchased and cancelled, through its normal course issuer bid, 549,500 common shares, bringing the total shares purchased in the first six months of 2013 to 1,418,672 for a total cost of approximately $4.4 million, or $3.13 per share including commissions. The number of shares outstanding has been reduced to approximately 60.4 million. Also in the second quarter, Pulse made a $5.0 million payment against its revolving syndicated credit facility. At June 30, 2013 long-term debt(b) was $20.8 million with $28.9 million remaining available for future draws. Pulse paid two dividends of $0.02 per share each, in the second quarter, totaling $2.4 million. The first, paid in April, had been declared in the first quarter and the second was both declared and paid in the second quarter of 2013."Revenue fluctuations are part of the seismic data library business, and Pulse's current results further confirm the Board of Directors' decision to set the Company's dividend at a conservative, sustainable level, one that has been maintained over the past 8 quarters," Coleman stated.Story continues(a)The Company's continuous disclosure documents provide discussion and analysis of "cash EBITDA", "cash EBITDA per share", "shareholder free cash flow" and "shareholder free cash flow per share". These financial measures do not have standard definitions prescribed by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies. The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures because management, investors, analysts and others use them as measures of the Company's financial performance. The Company's definition of cash EBITDA is cash available for interest payments, cash taxes if applicable, debt servicing, discretionary capital expenditures and the payment of dividends, and is calculated as earnings (loss) from operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization less participation survey revenue, plus any non-cash and non-recurring expenses. Cash EBITDA excludes participation survey revenue as these funds are directly used to fund specific participation surveys and this revenue is not available for discretionary capital expenditures. The Company believes cash EBITDA assists investors in comparing Pulse's results on a consistent basis without regard to participation survey revenue and non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary significantly depending on accounting methods or non-operating factors such as historical cost. Cash EBITDA per share is defined as cash EBITDA divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Shareholder free cash flow further refines the calculation of capital available to invest in growing the Company's 2D and 3D seismic data library, to repay debt, to purchase its common shares and to pay dividends by deducting non-discretionary expenditures from cash EBITDA. Non-discretionary expenditures are defined as debt financing costs (net of deferred financing expenses amortized in the current period) and current tax provisions. Shareholder free cash flow per share is defined as shareholder free cash flow divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.(b)Long-term debt is defined as total long-term debt, including current portion, net of deferred financing costs.Q2 2013 CONFERENCE CALLPulse will host a conference call on Friday, August 2, 2013 at 11:00 am MDT (1:00 pm EDT) to discuss the Company's results for the second quarter.
