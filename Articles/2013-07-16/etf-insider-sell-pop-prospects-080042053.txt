Here is a look at ETFs that currently offer attractive short selling opportunities. The ETFs included in this list are rated as sell candidates for two reasons; first, each of these funds is deemed to be in a downtrend based on the fact that it is trading below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, which are popular indicators for gauging long-term and medium-term trends respectively.Second, each of these ETFs is also trading above its 5-day moving average, thereby offering a near-term “sell on the pop” opportunity given the longer-term downtrend at hand. Note that this prospects list also features a liquidity screen by excluding ETFs with average trading volumes below the $100k mark. As always, investors of all experience levels are advised to use stop-loss orders and practice disciplined profit-taking techniques.To get access to all ETF Insider recommendations, sign up for a free 14-day trial of ETFdb Pro.Pro Membership Required to Continue ReadingETFdb ProTo continue reading this article, you must be an ETFdb Pro member.
