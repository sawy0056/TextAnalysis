THE TAKEAWAY: An attempted recovery from the US Dollar has been cut short at technical resistance while the S&P 500 has pushed higher to challenge the May swing high.Capitalize on Shifts in Market Mood with the DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index.US DOLLAR TECHNICAL ANALYSIS – Prices turned lower as expected, finding initial support at 10803 marked by the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement. A bullish Piercing Line candlestick pattern hints at the potential for renewed upside momentum. However, a Doji candle formed on a test of initial resistance at 10882 – the 23.6% level – points to indecision and injects a degree of doubt in bullish follow-through. Confirmation on a close above 10882 exposes the July 8 high at 11009. Alternatively, a reversal below support aims for the 50% Fib at 10739.View photosForex_US_Dollar_Stalls_at_Resistance_SP_500_Challenges_May_Top_body_Picture_5.png, US Dollar Stalls at Resistance, S&P 500 Challenges May TopMoreDaily Chart - Created Using FXCM Marketscope 2.0S&P 500 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS – Prices moved higher as expected after putting in a bullish Piercing Line candlestick pattern.
