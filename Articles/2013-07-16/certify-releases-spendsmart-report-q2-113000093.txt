Yet McDonald's lost its former top dinner spot to airport restaurant company HMS Host, which had 1.59% of receipts for an average of $21.36."Despite a few shifts, our latest report indicates how entrenched the top spots are in each category and how difficult it is for vendors to grab market share from each other in a highly-competitive environment for business dollars," says Robert Neveu, CEO of Certify. "The SpendSmart Report is a valuable barometer of not only the most-expensed vendors but also which ones are delivering the highest customer satisfaction levels, so that finance departments can help guide their employees on both cost and value in T&E spending."
