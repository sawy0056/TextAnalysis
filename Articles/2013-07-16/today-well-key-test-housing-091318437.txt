home construction las vegasMoreREUTERS/Steve MarcusOne of the biggest concerns right now for the US economy is the fact that rates are rising, and potentially threatening to choke off, or at least slow down the housing recovery.The housing recovery has been integral to the overall economic recovery, so the way this issue gets resolved is of major importance.This week we get a fair amount of housing data (most of it tomorrow) but today we get a key datapoint.From Calculated Risk: • At 10:00 AM, the July NAHB homebuilder survey will be released. The consensus is for a reading of 52, the same as in June.
