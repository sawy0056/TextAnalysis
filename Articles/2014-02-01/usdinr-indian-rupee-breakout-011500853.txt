The greenback closed higher by 1.65% week- on- week, at Rs. 62.6800, versus the Indian rupee; capping two weeks of negative closes. The near- month futures added Rs. 1.0850, to end the week with gains of 1.76%. Volumes on the front- month January futures rose to 4.45 million contracts, up from 3.7 million the previous week, while open interest stood at 339,090 contracts, down from 528,000 contracts, the earlier week. In economic data, the Reserve bank of India; the country’s central bank, hiked the repo rate by 25 basis points to 8.00% today; surprising markets after a Reuters poll last week predicted the rates to be unchanged. In its policy statement, the central bank said that further hikes were unlikely if inflation eased to a more comfortable level. The consumer price index (CPI), seen as the key gauge of inflation, rose at an annual rate of 9.87% in December. The Indian rupee and the stock markets slumped to multi- month lows after the news, before recouping most of the losses for the session. Technical view- Spot USD/INR The US dollar ended the session on Monday with gains of 0.67% versus the INR, closing the third successive session with gains. The gains are likely to extend to INR63.7500- 64.0000; top end of the channel plotted from the highs of November 2013, where the pair is likely to face some selling pressure. However, close above the resistances, the rally should continue to INR 64.7500- 65.0000, where the near term highs are likely to be capped.
