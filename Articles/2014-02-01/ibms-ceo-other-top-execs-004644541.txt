ARMONK, N.Y. (AP) -- IBM CEO Virginia Rometty and the rest of her senior management team are relinquishing their 2013 bonuses as penance for the technology company's lackluster performance last year.The decision disclosed in a Friday regulatory filing will result in a substantial pay cut for the affected executives, whose annual bonuses often exceed their salaries.As CEO, Rometty will be the hardest hit. She received a $3.9 million bonus in 2012 and was eligible for a $4 million payout last year, although it's unlikely she would have received that much because IBM's financial results didn't live up to expectations.IBM's revenue slipped 5 percent last year. The Armonk, N.Y., company's earnings dipped by less than 1 percent, thanks to cost cutting.Rometty still received a $1.5 million salary last year.
