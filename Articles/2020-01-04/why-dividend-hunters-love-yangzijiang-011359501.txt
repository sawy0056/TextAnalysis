(SGX:BS6)Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosCould Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) Ltd. (SGX:BS6) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings). We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. During the year, the company also conducted a buyback equivalent to around 0.5% of its market capitalisation. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis SGX:BS6 Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 27% of Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings)'s profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) paid out 56% of its free cash flow last year, which is acceptable, but is starting to limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested into the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.With a strong net cash balance, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.We update our data on Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings)'s dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was CN¥0.17 in 2010, compared to CN¥0.25 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 3.8% per year over this time.Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think is seriously impressive.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Earnings have grown at around 3.1% a year for the past five years, which is better than seeing them shrink! A payout ratio below 50% leaves ample room to reinvest in the business, and provides finanical flexibility. However, earnings per share are unfortunately not growing much. Might this suggest that the company should pay a higher dividend instead?Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings)'s dividend payout ratios are within normal bounds, although we note its cash flow is not as strong as the income statement would suggest. Earnings per share growth has been slow, but we respect a company that maintains a relatively stable dividend. Overall we think Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) is an interesting dividend stock, although it could be better.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
