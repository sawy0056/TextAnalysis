Brit's Home includes play space, classrooms, a medical/dental clinic and a structured, supportive, culturally sensitive setting provided by the Haitian staff and dedicated to creating an atmosphere where children can develop and thrive.In addition, BLB has brought over 1,800 people to Haiti through their "Britsionary" Program and have constructed over 145 houses. Since Hurricane Matthew, the Britsionarys have been helping to build homes for those whose homes were severely damaged and/or lost in the destruction.Contact Information(508) 886-4500Media@BeLikeBrit.orgwww.BeLikeBrit.org Related Imagesbritney-gengel.jpg Britney Gengel Britney Gengel 3 hours before the earthquakeRelated LinksTen Year Anniversary Important Documents Main Website Related Videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyfJyLQukps CisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/be-like-brit-foundation-marks-10-year-anniversary-of-haiti-earthquake-300980538.htmlSOURCE The Be Like Brit Foundation, IncReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLatin American leaders used state repression against protests: AmnestyAFPRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
