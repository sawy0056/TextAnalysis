(NYSE:FDP) A Quality Stock?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosMany investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (NYSE:FDP).Our data shows Fresh Del Monte Produce has a return on equity of 3.4% for the last year. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each $1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made $0.03 in profit. View our latest analysis for Fresh Del Monte Produce How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Fresh Del Monte Produce:3.4% = US$62m ÷ US$1.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does Return On Equity Signify?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, all else being equal, a high ROE is better than a low one. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does Fresh Del Monte Produce Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Fresh Del Monte Produce has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Food industry.NYSE:FDP Past Revenue and Net Income, January 3rd 2020MoreThat's not what we like to see. We prefer it when the ROE of a company is above the industry average, but it's not the be-all and end-all if it is lower. Still, shareholders might want to check if insiders have been selling.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining Fresh Del Monte Produce's Debt And Its 3.4% Return On EquityWhile Fresh Del Monte Produce does have some debt, with debt to equity of just 0.34, we wouldn't say debt is excessive. Its ROE is rather low, and it does use some debt, albeit not much. That's not great to see. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company's ability to take advantage of future opportunities.In SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
