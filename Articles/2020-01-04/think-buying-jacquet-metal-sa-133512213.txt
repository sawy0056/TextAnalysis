As a small cap stock, hardly covered by any analysts, there is generally more of an opportunity for mispricing as there is less activity to push the stock closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity here to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Jacquet Metal Service’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Jacquet Metal Service What is Jacquet Metal Service worth?Good news, investors! Jacquet Metal Service is still a bargain right now. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Jacquet Metal Service’s ratio of 9.69x is below its peer average of 15.58x, which suggests the stock is undervalued compared to the Trade Distributors industry. What’s more interesting is that, Jacquet Metal Service’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Jacquet Metal Service look like?ENXTPA:JCQ Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Jacquet Metal Service, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? Although JCQ is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to JCQ, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on JCQ for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
