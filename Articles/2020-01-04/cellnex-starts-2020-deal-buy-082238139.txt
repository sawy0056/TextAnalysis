The venture, known as OMTEL, operates 3,000 sites across Portugal.The deal will be paid for in cash and has an enterprise value of 800 million euros, according to the statement. The assets, including the rollout of 400 sites over the next four years, will add 2.5 billion euros to Cellnex sales. The company’s shares rose 2.1% at 9:08 a.m. in Madrid.The transaction suggests European phone carriers looking to raise funds by monetizing their towers may continue to find demand for the assets in 2020 as they did in 2019. The steady, long-term cash-flow generated by mast operators has attracted private equity, infrastructure funds, and other investors.It also marks a quick turnaround for the sellers. The joint venture was formed less than 18 months ago when Morgan Stanley and Horizon acquired 75% of Altice’s Portuguese tower unit for an enterprise value of 660 million euros. At the time, Cellnex had shown interest in the assets.The deal is a “strategic positive” for Cellnex as it expands its footprint, and a “modest positive” for Altice, Andrew Lee, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a research note.Cellnex was the second-best performer on the Stoxx 600 Telecommunications Index last year, with a 94% increase. The top performer was Altice, at 238%.To contact the reporter on this story: Rodrigo Orihuela in Madrid at rorihuela@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Charles Penty at cpenty@bloomberg.net, Andrew NoëlFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLimited Virus Testing in Japan Masks True Scale of InfectionBloombergOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergChina Stock Option’s 2,800% Surge Shows Rush for HedgesBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2014 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
