The $2.00 level should be a major psychological barrier to break through, so I think that will continue to be something to pay attention to, as the natural gas markets have had a horrific winter. That being said, the market is likely to see a bit of a bounce from here, but I think it’s only a matter of time before sellers will come back in based upon what we have seen this winter. I think that longer-term traders may be able to reach towards the $2.80 level, but it is going to be very difficult to get back up there.NATGAS Video 06.01.20Ultimately, if we were to break down below the $2.00 level, the market would more than likely reach down to extreme lows, and at that point quite frankly I’m not even sure where we would go it would be such a massive wipe out. This is a market that should continue to see a lot of bearish pressure overall come signs of exhaustion, and at this point in time it’s likely that we will see a bit of a “dead cat bounce”, but I wouldn’t read too much more intimate than that. Natural gas continues to be oversupplied as the Americans drilled 17% more this past year than the previous one. At the same time, winter temperatures have been exactly been cold in the US or Europe.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
