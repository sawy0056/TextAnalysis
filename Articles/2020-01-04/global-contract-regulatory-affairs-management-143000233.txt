The study features an in-depth analysis, highlighting the capabilities of the various CROs engaged in this domain, across different regions of the globe.One of the key objectives of this report was to evaluate the current opportunity and the future potential of the medical device regulatory affairs outsourcing market over the coming decade. We have provided an informed estimate of the likely evolution of the market in the short to mid-term and long term, for the period 2019-2030.In addition, we have provided the likely distribution of the opportunity across different:[A] types of regulatory affair management service offered (legal representation, project registration and clinical trial application, regulatory writing and publishing and 6+ categories) [B] device class (class I, class II and class III) [C] therapeutic areas (cardiovascular disorders, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, metabolic disorders, oncological disorders, orthopedic disorders, ophthalmic disorders, pain disorders, respiratory disorders, and others) [D] geographical regions (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and rest of the world)In 2018, the global medical devices market was estimated to have reached a net worth of approximately USD 450 billion. It is also worth noting that, since January 2018, the USFDA approved over 130 medical devices. However, a relatively large proportion of developers lack the resources and technical expertise required to handle regulatory filings and effectively manage the processes associated with procuring marketing authorizations from regional regulators. Moreover, keeping up with evolving regulatory guidelines, rising costs of legal advice and increasing effort required for preparing of technical documentation, is difficult for companies with limited finances. In addition, establishing reimbursement strategies for medium to high-risk devices is also a complicated process and innovator companies usually do not have the expertise to deal with payers and insurance providers.According to a recent report, 68% of medical device companies reports prepared and submitted by in-house players are either rejected or were reported to have multiple major gaps in their clinical evaluation report (CER) and supporting evidences by the notified bodies. In fact. in a survey published in the 2016 edition of Global Medical Device Supply Chain, regulatory requirements were highlighted among the primary areas of concern within the medical device value chain. Furthermore, the implementation of highly stringent regulatory guidelines, specifically for devices posing medium to high risk to consumers, render them subject to rigorous quality assessments. The aforementioned challenges have led many medical device developers, especially the smaller players and certain established companies as well, to outsource parts of their regulatory operations to capable contract research organizations (CROs). Generally, CROs are known to offer a number of benefits, which include cost benefits, reductions in time-to-market and, in this specific case, an in-depth and up-to date regulatory support. Given that the global demand for medical devices is increasing at a substantial pace, the opportunity for CROs with expertise in regulatory affairs management is also on the rise.In the foreseen future, the growing complexity of regulatory processes across various developing and developed geographies is likely to prompt more developers to outsource various aspects of their dealings with regulatory authorities. Moreover, in order to cope up with latest changes in medical device-related regulations, several legacy CROs are re-evaluating their operational models and business strategies. Owing to the anticipated rise in demand for such services, the contract regulatory services domain is likely to witness the entry of a number of new players in the foreseen future.Story continuesAmongst other elements, the report includes:A detailed review of the current market landscape of the medical devices regulatory affairs outsourcing market, featuring a list of over 400 CROs engaged in this domain, and detailed analysis based on a number of relevant parameters, such as year of establishment, size of employee base, geographical location, device class (class I, class II, and class III), type and size of clientele (medical device developers, medical device manufacturers, medical device research organizations, and others), types of services offered, ([A] regulatory management services (such as legal representation, notified body selection, project registration and clinical trial application, regulatory writing and publishing, regulatory document submission, product labelling related service, gap analysis, technical dossier set-up, vigilance & medical device report, risk management-related services), [B] additional services (such as biostatistics, consulting, clinical operations, post-marketing activities, quality assurance, reimbursement, training)), region(s) of operation wherein the company is offering regulatory management services, and popular therapeutic area(s).
