The automaker wants to completely localize its China supply chain by end-2020, it said at the time.Tesla plans to ramp up Model 3 deliveries in January and will double the number of service centers and fast charging stations in China in 2020, its executives have said.The plant has achieved a production target of 1,000 units per week, or around 280 cars a day, and that sales for the China-made sedan had so far been "very good", according to the executives.(Reporting by Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh; Editing by Himani Sarkar)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersInvestors in Asia Still Betting Markets Will End Higher in 2020BloombergGlobal coronavirus cases rise as China’s downward trend continuesPA Media: World NewsHow Does China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings Limited (HKG:512) Stand Up To These Simple Dividend Safety Checks?Simply Wall St.Here's How We Evaluate China Gas Holdings Limited's (HKG:384) DividendSimply Wall St.Richard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
