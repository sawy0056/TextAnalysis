But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the De.mem Limited (ASX:DEM) share price is up 89% in the last year, clearly besting the market return of around 18% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! De.mem hasn't been listed for long, so it's still not clear if it is a long term winner. Check out our latest analysis for De.mem Given that De.mem didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.In the last year De.mem saw its revenue shrink by 5.1%. The stock is up 89% in that time, a fine performance given the revenue drop. To us that means that there isn't a lot of correlation between the past revenue performance and the share price, but a closer look at analyst forecasts and the bottom line may well explain a lot.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).ASX:DEM Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.
