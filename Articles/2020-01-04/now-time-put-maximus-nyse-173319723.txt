But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like MAXIMUS (NYSE:MMS). Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. See our latest analysis for MAXIMUS How Quickly Is MAXIMUS Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). It's no surprise, then, that I like to invest in companies with EPS growth. Over the last three years, MAXIMUS has grown EPS by 11% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note MAXIMUS's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 21% to US$2.9b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of MAXIMUS's forecast profits?Are MAXIMUS Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I like company leaders to have some skin in the game, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. So it is good to see that MAXIMUS insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Given insiders own a small fortune of shares, currently valued at US$55m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like MAXIMUS with market caps between US$4.0b and US$12b is about US$6.6m.The MAXIMUS CEO received total compensation of just US$3.2m in the year to September 2018. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance, that arrangement seems generous to shareholders, and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Does MAXIMUS Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for MAXIMUS is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Earnings growth might be the main game for MAXIMUS, but the fun does not stop there. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if MAXIMUS is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Story continuesYou can invest in any company you want.
