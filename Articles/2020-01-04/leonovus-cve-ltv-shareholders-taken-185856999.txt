We really hate to see fellow investors lose their hard-earned money. Imagine if you held LeoNovus Inc. (CVE:LTV) for half a decade as the share price tanked 92%. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 90% in the last year. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 63% in the last three months.While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness. View our latest analysis for LeoNovus LeoNovus recorded just US$22,000 in revenue over the last twelve months, which isn't really enough for us to consider it to have a proven product. We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems that the investors focused more on what could be, than paying attention to the current revenues (or lack thereof). It seems likely some shareholders believe that LeoNovus will significantly advance the business plan before too long.We think companies that have neither significant revenues nor profits are pretty high risk. There is usually a significant chance that they will need more money for business development, putting them at the mercy of capital markets. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt. It certainly is a dangerous place to invest, as LeoNovus investors might realise.Our data indicates that LeoNovus had US$18k more in total liabilities than it had cash, when it last reported in September 2019. That makes it extremely high risk, in our view. But since the share price has dived -39% per year, over 5 years , it looks like some investors think it's time to abandon ship, so to speak.

What if insiders are ditching the stock hand over fist? I'd like that just about as much as I like to drink milk and fruit juice mixed together. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.A Different PerspectiveLeoNovus shareholders are down 90% for the year, but the market itself is up 19%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 39% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
