But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings) (LON:MAB1), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings) Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings)'s Earnings Per Share Are Growing.As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings) has grown EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). I note that Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings)'s revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort my analysis of its margins. While we note Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings)'s EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 7.9% to UK£126m. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.One positive for Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings), is that company insiders paid UK£21k for shares in the last year. This might not be a huge sum, but it's well worth noting anyway, given the complete lack of selling.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings) bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. Notably, they have an enormous stake in the company, worth UK£122m. That equates to 30% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Very encouraging.While insiders already own a significant amount of shares, and they have been buying more, the good news for ordinary shareholders does not stop there. That's because on our analysis the CEO, Peter Christopher Brodnicki, is paid less than the median for similar sized companies. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings) with market caps between UK£152m and UK£608m is about UK£667k.Story continuesThe Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings) CEO received UK£499k in compensation for the year ending December 2018. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given its below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings) Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Mortgage Advice Bureau (Holdings) is that it is growing profits. Better yet, insiders are significant shareholders, and have been buying more shares. To me, that all makes it well worth a spot on your watchlist, as well as continuing research.
