And it managed to improve earnings by $140.9 million, or 82.6 percent over 2018, he testified."Looking at other domestic and foreign passenger rail operators, these results are truly industry-leading, and this efficiency enables us to dedicate the highest possible proportion of our federal support to vital capital investments in safety, capacity and upgrades to enhance our customers' experience while traveling," he added.EVEN WHEN NOT AT FAULT, AMTRAK CAN BARE COST OF ACCIDENTSWhile Amtrak has received tens of billions of dollars in federal subsidies since the 1970s, Anderson has a long-term goal to break even, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.Skeptics of goals for the railroad service say trying to reach profitability will ultimately cause Amtrak to suffer, according to the Journal."I think part of the problem we’re dealing with is the original mandate from Congress, which said that this is supposed to be run as a for-profit corporation,"  Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., the House Transportation Committee chair, said according to the Journal. "I think they should think about efficiency but not profit … Amtrak is a service, and it can be a better service."GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREHowever, breaking even is the only way for Amtrak to improve its service for customers across the nation, Anthony Coscia, Amtrak Board of Investors chair, told the Journal.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSRelated ArticlesBest Buy Celebrates 50 Yrs With Saleathon; Will It Turn 60?Canadian Solar Is Facing More Challenges Than It AppearsTarget Adds Private Bathrooms to Quell Transgender DebateReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAmtrak to Begin Repairs to Tunnels Beneath Hudson RiverThe Wall Street JournalU.S. transportation chief backs rehabilitation of key NYC rail tunnelReuters20 pledges for 2020: Why sleeper trains are (sometimes) quicker than flyingThe Independent‘Could have been beyond tragic’: Family nearly hit by train while taking photos on rail tracksThe IndependentEgg freezing laws not fit for purpose and force women into 'heartbreaking' scenario of destroying eggsThe IndependentRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
