The market scenario of DID class (public DID, private DID), user type (individual, enterprise), identity modality (physiological, behavioral), and application (finance, government, healthcare, housing, and mobility, among others) have been analyzed qualitatively. The report also covers the decentralized identity market on a global scale and consequently, gives a key overview of the market scenario in different regions. A separate segment specifically has been dedicated to the key global regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific (APAC), and Rest-of-the World.Based on DID class, the global decentralized identity market is segmented into public DID and private DID. Public DIDs are appropriate for users who want an activity or interaction to be linked to them, which can be verified by other users. Public DIDs usually face an issue of being traceable, as all the activities are linked to a single DID. This results in a number of privacy and safety risks. Hence, pairwise DIDs are used, which can be generated whenever a user wants their interactions to be isolated and also prevent correlation. Apart from DID class, the report also provides a comprehensive outlook on applications. The market scenario is currently more dominant in the banking & financial sector for user KYC and authentication. The use cases prevalent in the industry is more inclined toward the banking sector, due to a growing number of cyberthreats and privacy issues faced by the customers.Key Companies in the Global MarketA list of 15 Decentralized Identity companies has been analyzed in the report, including platform and solution vendors, trust service providers, system integrators, and service providers.
