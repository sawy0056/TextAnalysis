For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed.So should JDF Explorations (CSE:JDF) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. See our latest analysis for JDF Explorations Does JDF Explorations Have A Long Cash Runway?A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. When JDF Explorations last reported its balance sheet in October 2019, it had zero debt and cash worth CA$121. Importantly, its cash burn was CA$157k over the trailing twelve months. Therefore, from October 2019 it seems to us it had less than two months of cash runway. To be frank we are alarmed by how short that cash runway is! The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.CNSX:JDF Historical Debt, January 2nd 2020MoreHow Is JDF Explorations's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?JDF Explorations didn't record any revenue over the last year, indicating that it's an early stage company still developing its business. Nonetheless, we can still examine its cash burn trajectory as part of our assessment of its cash burn situation. The skyrocketing cash burn up 125% year on year certainly tests our nerves. That sort of spending growth rate can't continue for very long before it causes balance sheet weakness, generally speaking. JDF Explorations makes us a little nervous due to its lack of substantial operating revenue. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.Can JDF Explorations Raise More Cash Easily?Given its cash burn trajectory, JDF Explorations shareholders should already be thinking about how easy it might be for it to raise further cash in the future. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).Since it has a market capitalisation of CA$9.1m, JDF Explorations's CA$157k in cash burn equates to about 1.7% of its market value. That means it could easily issue a few shares to fund more growth, and might well be in a position to borrow cheaply.Is JDF Explorations's Cash Burn A Worry?On this analysis of JDF Explorations's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its cash runway has us a bit worried. After looking at that range of measures, we think shareholders should be extremely attentive to how the company is using its cash, as the cash burn makes us uncomfortable. While we always like to monitor cash burn for early stage companies, qualitative factors such as the CEO pay can also shed light on the situation.
