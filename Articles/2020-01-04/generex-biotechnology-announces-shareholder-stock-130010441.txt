Although unfortunate, the delay is temporary and Generex is committed to delivering the dividends to shareholders as soon as the approvals are obtained. Please remember if you sell your shares before the ex-date you will get a pay due bill and your dividend shares will go to the buyer. Conversely, if you buy shares up through the ex-date, you will receive the dividend through the “Pay Due” system and the seller will automatically pay you the dividends through broker to broker transfer.Joe Moscato, President & CEO of Generex said, “I would like to thank all of our shareholders for your patience in this process. As a result of FINRA’s continuing review of the revised dividend, and with the addition of the NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology stock dividend, the FINRA review process was delayed over the holiday. Having provided all documentation necessary, Generex is simply waiting on FINRA to post its approval with the DTC so that brokers are prepared to accept and record the dividend shares into shareholder accounts. As per guidance from regulators, we expect the approvals next week, so the new pay date for the long-awaited dividend will be January 10, 2020. We will notify shareholders as soon as we hear of the approval from FINRA.”Mr. Moscato continued, “Personally, I cannot wait to finally pay this dividend that shareholders deserve for believing in our plans that we started 3 years ago on January 17, 2017. Once the dividend is paid, we can concentrate on building the enterprise value of the acquisitions we have made in the orthopedic and wound care space, launching our end-to-end solution for diabetes care in Arizona, bringing NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology public, and closing the ALTuCELL deal to initiate the clinical development of their cutting-edge cell therapy for Type I diabetes. Again, thanks for your patience and we are looking towards positive results for Generex and our NuGenerex family of subsidiary companies in 2020.”About Generex Biotechnology Corp.
