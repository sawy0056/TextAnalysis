The functional and aesthetic advantages of underground distribution, along with improved reliability and decreased downtime, would further aid the growth of this market. The high installation cost of pad-mounted switchgear is a restraint for the growth of the pad-mounted switchgear market.The global pad-mounted switchgear market is dominated by a few major players that have an extensive global and regional presence. The leading players in the pad-mounted switchgear market are Eaton (Ireland), Hubbell (US), Federal Pacific (US), S&C Electric (US), G&W Electric (US), ABB (Switzerland), and AZZ (US).The IEC segment is expected to dominate the pad-mounted switchgear market in 2019The IEC segment is expected to dominate the pad-mounted switchgear market in 2019, owing to the increasing installation of pad-mounted switchgear in various countries across the globe. The widespread adoption of IEC standard equipment in Europe is responsible for the dominance of the IEC standard in the pad-mounted switchgear market. Europe is one of the largest markets for pad-mounted switchgear. The increasing adoption of IEC as a standard for all the pad-mount switchgear installed in the region is leading to the market growth of the IEC standard pad-mounted switchgear.The pad-mounted switchgear, the solid dielectric type is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast periodThe solid dielectric segment is estimated to grow at the fastest rate of all segments during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the restrictions on sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). SF6 has the worst global warming potential of all gases and is largely emitted from the power sector. Increased restrictions on SF6 is expected to slow down the growth of gas-insulated switchgear and drive the market for SF6 alternatives. Solid dielectric is a better alternative to SF6, as the insulating medium is epoxy, which is inert and environmentally safe.Europe is expected to lead the global pad-mounted switchgear market in terms of market sizeEurope is currently the largest pad-mounted switchgear market, followed by North America and the Asia Pacific. Many utilities in Europe adopt underground distribution, given the advantages of underground distribution, especially in densely populated areas and hazardous locations. Many countries in Europe, such as the Netherlands, have a 100% underground distribution system. Europe is expected to be the biggest market for pad-mounted switchgear during the forecast period.Key Topics Covered1 Introduction2 Research Methodology3 Executive Summary4 Premium Insights4.1 Attractive Opportunities in the Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market4.2 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By Standard4.3 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By Voltage4.4 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By End-user4.5 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By Type4.6 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By Region5 Market Overview5.1 Introduction5.2 Market Dynamics5.2.1 Drivers5.2.1.1 Increasing Development in T&D Infrastructure5.2.1.2 High Reliability of Underground Distribution Systems5.2.1.3 Need for Upgrading the Aging Power Infrastructure5.2.1.4 Increasing Adoption of Distribution Automation to Achieve Highly Reliable and Safe Power Transmission5.2.2 Restraints5.2.2.1 High Installation Cost Associated With Pad-Mounted Switchgears5.2.2.2 Fierce Competition From Unorganized Or Fragmented Switchgear Markets5.2.3 Opportunities5.2.3.1 Growing Trend of Adopting Underground Distribution Systems in Developing Countries5.2.3.2 Implementation of Performance-Based Incentive Schemes and Guaranteed Service Programs5.2.3.3 Stringent Environmental and Safety Regulations Imposed on the Use of Sf65.2.4 Challenges5.2.4.1 Installation of Underground Distribution Systems Faces Challenges in Unplanned Cities6 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By Application6.1 Introduction6.2 Industrial6.2.1 Growing Investments in Europe and North America are Likely to Drive the Industrial Pad-Mounted Switchgear Industry6.3 Commercial6.3.1 Increasing Energy Demand in the Commercial Sector is Expected to Drive the Demand for Pad-Mount Switchgears for Commercial Applications6.4 Residential6.4.1 Rising Demand for Reliable Power in Residential Complexes is Driving the Pad-Mounted Switchgear Industry in Residential Applications7 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By Standard7.1 Introduction7.2 International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)7.3 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)7.4 Other Standards8 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By Type8.1 Introduction8.2 Air Insulated8.2.1 Air Insulated Switchgear Finds Extensive Application in Low Voltage Distribution Networks8.3 Gas Insulated8.3.1 Gas Insulated Pad-Mounted Switchgear Segment is Expected to Lead the Market During the Forecast Period8.4 Solid Dielectric8.4.1 Restrictions on the Use of Sf6 May Aid the Growth of the Solid Dielectric Switchgear Segment8.5 Others9 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By Voltage9.1 Introduction9.2 Up to 15 kV9.2.1 Increasing Demand for Up to 15 kV Pad-Mounted Switchgears in Residential Applications is Expected to Drive the Market9.3 15-25 kV9.3.1 Increasing Demand for 15-25 kV Pad-Mounted Switchgears in Feeder and Substation Automation Applications is Likely to Propel the Market9.4 25-38 kV9.4.1 Growth in the Industrial and Commercial Sectors is Expected to Boost the Demand for the 25-38 kV Segment10 Pad-Mounted Switchgear Market, By Region10.1 Introduction10.2 Asia-Pacific10.3 Europe10.4 North America10.5 Middle East & Africa10.6 South America11 Competitive Landscape11.1 Overview11.2 Competitive Leadership Mapping (Overall Market)11.2.1 Visionary Leaders11.2.2 Innovators11.2.3 Dynamic Differentiators11.2.4 Emerging Players11.3 Market Share, 201811.4 Competitive Scenario11.4.1 New Product Launches11.4.2 Mergers & Acquisitions11.4.3 Contracts & Agreements11.4.4 Others12 Company Profiles12.1 Eaton12.2 Hubbell12.3 G&W Electric12.4 S&C Electric12.5 Federal Pacific12.6 ABB12.7 Powell12.8 Electronic & Electrical Industries Corporation12.9 Trayer Switchgear12.10 Tiepco12.11 Entec12.12 KDM Steel12.13 Switchgear Power Systems12.14 Scott Engineering12.15 Park Detroit12.16 AZZ12.17 Beijing Kylin Power & Technology12.18 Actom12.19 OrmazabalStory continuesFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/wlmm46Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager press@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
