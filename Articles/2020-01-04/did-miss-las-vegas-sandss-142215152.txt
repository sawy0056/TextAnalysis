But if you're going to beat the market overall, you need to have individual stocks that outperform. One such company is Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), which saw its share price increase 36% in the last year, slightly above the market return of around 31% (not including dividends). The longer term returns are positive, with the share price up 29% in three years. View our latest analysis for Las Vegas Sands To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the last year, Las Vegas Sands actually saw its earnings per share drop 49%.Given the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.For starters, we suspect the share price has been buoyed by the dividend, which was increased during the year. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield, pushing the price up in the process.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).NYSE:LVS Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreLas Vegas Sands is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Las Vegas Sands in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Las Vegas Sands the TSR over the last year was 43%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Las Vegas Sands has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 43% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
