Following a high of nearly $500 per coin during the summer, BCH has been on a steady decline ever since.
Bitcoin Cash just trumped Bitcoin in Venezuela  In mid-November, for example, the cryptocurrency led the market in terms of losses, along with its close crypto-cousin Bitcoin SV.Nevertheless, Bitcoin Cash seems to be growing in popularity in regions such as Venezuela, where it is purportedly accepted by more shops and businesses than Bitcoin. So all hope for BCH hodlers isn’t lost.Meanwhile, crypto traders today are seeing green across the board. Bitcoin, for example, is up nearly 6 percent (possibly as a result of today’s airstrike in Iran). Ethereum is up around 5 percent and trading at $133 per coin, and Bitcoin SV is up 10 percent and currently worth $102 per coin.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCryptocurrency News: SEC Shuts Down Another Bitcoin ETFInvestopediaSteven Seagal Isn’t Above the Securities LawThe Wall Street JournalIran commander touts crypto as solution to bypass sanctionsCoin RivetSteven Seagal fined in US over cryptocurrency promotionAFPLatest Litecoin price and analysis (LTC to USD)Coin RivetRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
