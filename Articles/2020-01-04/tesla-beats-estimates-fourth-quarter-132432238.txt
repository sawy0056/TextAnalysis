With a market valuation of more than $80 billion, Tesla is far outstripping those of traditional carmakers General Motors Co <GM.N> and Ford Motor Co <F.N>.(Graphic: Tesla 2019 share movement click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/15/3945/3945/tesla.png)The delivery results defy skeptics of Musk, whose mercurial behavior over the last two years came under close scrutiny from federal regulators and shareholders of Tesla.Musk, who has more than 30 million Twitter followers, has a history of firing off tweets that resulted in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a defamation trial against him.The Tesla CEO settled the SEC complaint for $20 million in 2018 and a Los Angeles jury cleared Musk in the defamation case in December."Elon has Tesla executing right on track," said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin.CHINA RAMP-UPTesla also provided an update on its Shanghai factory, which has started churning out Model 3 cars. It said the plant demonstrated a production run-rate capability of more than 3,000 units per week.The run-rate shows that the factory appears to be ramping faster than expected, Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said. "Shanghai deliveries should be the next catalyst to drive volume growth."The $2-billion factory, Tesla's first car manufacturing site outside the United States, is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars.A company representative on Thursday said that Tesla will deliver its first China-made Model 3 sedans to the public on Jan. 7.The Model 3 is Tesla's most affordable car, with lower-range versions available starting at $35,000.Analysts in the past have questioned how rapidly Tesla's vehicle sales will grow as government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases dwindle in the United States, China and other markets. Some analysts consider those subsidies the biggest driver for Tesla purchases.Traditional automakers largely relying on fuel-powered vehicles on Friday reported a decline in fourth-quarter U.S. sales and saw their shares tumble as a widening conflict with Iran pushed oil prices more than $2 a barrel on Friday.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV <FCHA.MI> <FCAU.N> on Friday said it saw a 2% fall in U.S. auto sales, while GM reported its fourth-quarter U.S. deliveries were down more than 6%."The recently escalating geopolitical uncertainties driving oil prices higher are likely to create a tailwind for TSLA shares," Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer said.(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru, Tina Bellon in New York; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Nick Zieminski)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHow to buy a Tesla Cybertruck for just $400MarketWatchTesla shares slump as coronavirus hits China car registrationsReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
