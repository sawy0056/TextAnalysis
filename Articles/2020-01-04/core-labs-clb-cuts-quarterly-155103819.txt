Overall, curtailing investments in domestic upstream activities might affect rig demand. Hence, U.S. drillers may continue to lower the oil rig count in months ahead. This tough operating environment prompted oil service providers like Core Laboratories CLB to prioritize financial discipline over high-octane growth.As part of its efforts to decrease expenses, Core Labs recently cut its quarterly dividend and lowered fourth-quarter guidance. Following this move, the company’s shares declined 19%.This Netherlands-based oilfield service company slashed its quarterly dividend payout by almost 55% from 55 cents per share to 24 cents (made effective from first-quarter 2020). Management stated that this strategic action was necessary in the light of its aim to boost the existing cash position. This move aimed at strengthening the company’s balance sheet will likely lower Core Labs’ annual dividend distribution by roughly $53 million.The company’s Production Enhancement segment’s underperformance in the third quarter was primarily due to the reduction in U.S. land activity induced by lower U.S. onshore rig counts.
