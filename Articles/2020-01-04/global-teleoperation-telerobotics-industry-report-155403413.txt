The report also provides market forecasts for IIoT teleoperation and tele-robotics systems, services, and solutions. The report also evaluates the role of Digital Twin technology in teleoperation and tele-robotics. Teleoperation represents the ability to operate equipment or a machine from a distance. A specific form of teleoperation involving remote control of a robot from a distance is referred to as tele-robotics. Teleoperation and tele-robotics are both supported by ICT infrastructure including broadband communications, sensors, machine to machine (M2M) communications, and various Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Enhancements in wireless broadband are untethering teleoperation. Prior to 5G and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Teleoperation is largely relegated to fixed communications connections. 5G and MEC will enable Teleoperation anywhere there is 5G coverage, enabling many new consumer and industrial automation scenarios involving robotics.Advanced IoT systems will also utilize Digital Twin technology to enable next generation teleoperation. Digital Twinning refers to the mapping of the physical world to the digital world. Coupled with Haptic Internet technologies and Virtual Reality (VR), the teleoperation and tele-robotics market will take a major leap as user interfaces are democratized. No longer will special equipment (often located in special locations and controlled by proprietary systems) be required for control.In addition, the field of Cloud Robotics enables a teleoperation/tele-robotics as a service model, allowing fractional ownership and/or usage on demand. This will greatly expand the availability and usage of machines for industrial as well as enterprise applications.Key Topics Covered 1 Executive Summary2 Overview3 Automation and Robotics in Industrial IoT3.1 Industrial IoT in Context3.2 Technology Transformation: Broadband Communications3.3 Industrial Productivity and IIoT Economic Contribution3.4 Industrial Efficiency and IIoT3.5 IIoT Adoption Trends Globally3.6 Smart Factories, Intelligent Manufacturing, and Industry 4.03.7 Industrial Revolution and Migration3.8 IIoT Building Blocks3.9 Industrial Automation and IIoT3.10 Human Aspect of IIoT3.11 Integrated Digital and Human Workforce3.12 Wearable Technology and IIoT3.13 Workforce Augmentation3.14 Hybrid Industry and Robotics3.15 Drone Logistics4 Teleoperation and Telerobotics4.1 Telerobotics4.1.1 Agile Robots: Move like Humans in Dangerous Environments4.1.2 Collaborative Industrial Robots4.2 Telepresence4.3 Teleoperation4.4 Tele-manipulation4.5 Internet Telerobotics4.6 The Web and Telerobotics4.7 Real-time Transport Protocol4.8 Technical Architecture of Tele-robotics Systems4.8.1 Tele-robots4.8.2 Web Clients4.8.3 Communications4.8.4 Transmission Protocol4.9 Bilateral Control and Haptic Feedback4.9.1 The Robonaut Case4.10 Unilateral vs. Bilateral Model4.10.1 Performance Matrix5 Role of Teleoperation and Telerobotics in Automation5.1 The Role of Telerobotics in Industrial Automation5.2 Impact on Logistics and Supply Chain5.3 Industrial Producer/Consumer (Prosumer) Value Chain5.4 Employment Transformation and the Future for Factory Workers5.5 Clear Production5.6 Manufacturing Supply Chain and Robotics5.7 Connected Service and Teleoperation5.8 Benefits and Drawbacks5.9 Edge Computing for IoT5.10 Swarm Computing6 Impact of Teleoperation and Telerobotics6.1 Technologies facilitating Hyper Automation6.2 Rise of the Hybrid Enterprise to Optimize IIoT6.3 Intelligent Human Workforce: Augmented by AI and Robots6.4 Drone Logistics to become Common for B2B as well as B2C6.5 Industrial Robotics remains the Key Area of Focus6.6 Rise of the Smart Machine driven Factory of the Future6.7 Engaging the Consumer throughout the Product Lifecycle6.8 A Transformation to an Outcome Economy6.9 Information Technology and Operational Technology Convergence6.10 New Stakeholders Emerge and New Relationships Develop7 Teleoperation and Telerobotics in Edge Networks7.1 Edge Computing7.2 Multi-access Edge Computing7.3 Teleoperation and Telerobotics in MEC8 Teleoperation and Telerobotics Market Analysis and Forecasts8.1 Market for Teleoperation and Tele-robotics in IIoT 2019 - 20248.1.1 IIoT Teleoperation and Tele-robotics Solutions by Segment 2019 - 20248.1.2 IIoT Teleoperation and Tele-robotics Solutions by Region 2019 - 20248.1.3 IIoT Teleoperation and Tele-robotics Solutions by Tech and App 2019 - 20248.1.4 IIoT Teleoperation and Tele-robotics Solution by Industry Vertical 2019 -20248.1.5 Artificial Intelligence in IIoT Teleoperation and Tele-robotics Solutions8.2 Digital Twinning and Physical Asset Security8.3 IT Process Efficiency Increase8.4 AI to Replace Human Form Work8.5 Enterprise AI Adoption Trends8.6 Inclusion of AI as IT Requirement9 Conclusions and Recommendations9.1 Need for Enhanced Operational Support9.2 IIoT: Don't Forget the Consumer10 Appendix: Digital Twin Product and Service Ecosystem10.1 Digital Twinning Impact on Industry Segments10.1.1 Industrial IoT10.1.2 Consumer IoT10.2 Application Development and Operations10.2.1 IoT Application Programming Interfaces10.2.1.2 Virtual Objects and Control of Real Assets10.2.2 Identity Management, Authentication, and Authorization10.2.2.1 IoT Identity Management10.2.2.2 Virtual Identities for Digital Twinning Operations10.2.2.3 Authentication and Authorization10.3 Digital Twin Use Cases and Applications10.3.1 Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Operations10.3.2 Digital Avatar of Consumer Assets10.3.3 Performance/Service Monitoring10.3.4 Inspection and Repair10.3.5 Predictive Maintenance10.3.6 Product Design and Development10.3.6.1 Composite Assembling/Manufacturing10.3.7 Monitoring Business Outcomes10.4 Digital Twinning as a Service
