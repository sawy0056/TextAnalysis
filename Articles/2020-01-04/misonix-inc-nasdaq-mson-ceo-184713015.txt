See our latest analysis for Misonix How Does Stavros Vizirgianakis's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?Our data indicates that Misonix, Inc. is worth US$283m, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$554k for the year to June 2019. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at US$382k. We examined companies with market caps from US$100m to US$400m, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was US$1.1m.This would give shareholders a good impression of the company, since most similar size companies have to pay more, leaving less for shareholders.
