Haven assets including gold and Treasuries surged, while U.S. stock futures tumbled in early trading.Rising oil prices is a consumption tax The more important impact for the rest of the world, however, would be a protracted spike in oil prices. “Our base case here is that a full-blown war between the U.S. and Iran is unlikely,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note Friday. “The infrastructure of the oil sector, though, is a likely target in the event of tit-for-tat escalation.” In one possible method of retaliation, Iran could try to close off the Strait of Hormuz, a key passageway for more than a fifth of the world’s global petroleum liquids consumption and a region the U.S. Energy Information Administration has called “the world’s most important chokepoint.” The country has previously threatened to disrupt shipments in the Strait of Hormuz in response to U.S. attempts to choke the Iranian economy. In that scenario, Tuvey expects Brent crude prices would rally to $150 per barrel – pushing inflation up by some 3.5-4.0 percentage points in OECD countries, Tuvey said.And as Shepherdson noted, higher oil prices create “a tax on oil consumers and a windfall for producers.” “World oil consumption is about 100M barrels per day, so each five dollars on the prices is equivalent to an annualized tax of about $183B per year, or 0.1% of global GDP,” he said. However, the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would respond to oil price-driven inflationary increases with higher rates remains slim, he said, “given their understanding of the impact of higher oil prices, the tightness of the labor market and the coming increase in core inflation from tariff pass-through and a run of adverse base effects.” “The wild card is whether turmoil in the Middle East triggers a sustained sell-off in equities, depressing business and consumer confidence to the point where labor market and inflation concerns become secondary,” Shepherdson said. —Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter: @emily_mcckRead more from Emily:Here are the biggest stories that will drive the stock market in 202020 businesses that died in the 2010sStock Market 2020: BMO’s bull is reminded of Notorious B.I.G., Tupac and SnoopHow this CBD company created a buzz by ‘kind of making fun of millennial culture’Coca-Cola products are ‘out of touch with the modern consumer,' founder of Coca-Cola backed beverage co. saysFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit.Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance newsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; WHO Sees ‘Decisive’ Stage: Virus UpdateBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2014 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersWorld prepares for coronavirus pandemic; global recession forecastReutersOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
