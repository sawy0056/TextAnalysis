Less-covered, small caps sees more of an opportunity for mispricing due to the lack of information available to the public, which can be a good thing. So, could the stock still be trading at a low price relative to its actual value? Let’s examine Modine Manufacturing’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Modine Manufacturing What's the opportunity in Modine Manufacturing?According to my relative valuation model, the stock seems to be currently fairly priced. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 14.4x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 17.61x, which means if you buy Modine Manufacturing today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Modine Manufacturing should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Modine Manufacturing’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Modine Manufacturing generate?NYSE:MOD Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.
