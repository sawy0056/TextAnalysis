We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. Imagine if you held Nico Steel Holdings Limited (SGX:5GF) for half a decade as the share price tanked 98%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 25%.While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness. See our latest analysis for Nico Steel Holdings Given that Nico Steel Holdings didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.In the last five years Nico Steel Holdings saw its revenue shrink by 16% per year. That's definitely a weaker result than most pre-profit companies report. So it's not that strange that the share price dropped 52% per year in that period. We don't think this is a particularly promising picture. Ironically, that behavior could create an opportunity for the contrarian investor - but only if there are good reasons to predict a brighter future.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SGX:5GF Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreBalance sheet strength is crucial.

Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 52% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm.
