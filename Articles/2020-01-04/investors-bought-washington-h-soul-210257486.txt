Soul Pattinson (ASX:SOL) Shares Five Years Ago Are Now Up 58%Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosWhen we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Company Limited (ASX:SOL) share price is up 58% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 21% (ignoring dividends). View our latest analysis for Washington H. Soul Pattinson To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Washington H. Soul Pattinson achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 9.6% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:SOL Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Washington H. Soul Pattinson's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Washington H. Soul Pattinson the TSR over the last 5 years was 83%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 24% in the last year, Washington H. Soul Pattinson shareholders lost 11% (even including dividends) . However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.
