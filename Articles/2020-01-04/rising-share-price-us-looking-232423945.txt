The full year gain of 22% is pretty reasonable, too.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios.

Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.Art Group Holdings shrunk earnings per share by 17% over the last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 23%. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 29% per year over the last three years. This could justify a low P/E.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Is Debt Impacting Art Group Holdings's P/E?Art Group Holdings's net debt is 91% of its market cap.

With relatively high debt, and no earnings per share growth over twelve months, it's safe to say the market believes the company will improve its earnings growth in the future.
