They have fallen 30% in the past 12 months.Pointing to its big order backlog, the company issued a new sales goal for 2022, forecasting its core active safety and restraint control systems businesses would grow to $2.5 billion, with an compound annual growth rate of 19%.(Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom, editing by Terje Solsvik and Jason Neely)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
