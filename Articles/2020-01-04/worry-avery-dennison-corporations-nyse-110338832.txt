We'll show how you can use Avery Dennison Corporation's (NYSE:AVY) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity.

Check out our latest analysis for Avery Dennison How Do You Calculate Avery Dennison's P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Avery Dennison:P/E of 45.97 = $129.31 ÷ $2.81 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Avery Dennison Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. As you can see below, Avery Dennison has a higher P/E than the average company (19.1) in the packaging industry.NYSE:AVY Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Avery Dennison will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Avery Dennison saw earnings per share decrease by 20% last year. But EPS is up 3.8% over the last 5 years. And over the longer term (3 years) earnings per share have decreased 7.2% annually. This might lead to low expectations.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does Avery Dennison's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Avery Dennison has net debt worth 16% of its market capitalization. This could bring some additional risk, and reduce the number of investment options for management; worth remembering if you compare its P/E to businesses without debt.The Bottom Line On Avery Dennison's P/E RatioAvery Dennison's P/E is 46.0 which is above average (18.9) in its market. With some debt but no EPS growth last year, the market has high expectations of future profits.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
