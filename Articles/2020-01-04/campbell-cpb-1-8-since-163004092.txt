Shares have added about 1.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Campbell due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Campbell Q1 Earnings Top, Sales View Cut on DivestitureCampbell released first-quarter fiscal 2020 results. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations advanced 10% year over year to 78 cents and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. The upside was backed by greater adjusted EBIT and reduced interest expenses.Net sales dropped 1% to $2,183 million, owing to softness in the Meals & Beverages unit, somewhat compensated by strength in the Snacks unit. Further, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,194 million.Moving on, adjusted gross margin improved 0.3 percentage points on the back of cost-saving efforts, productivity enhancements and gains from the recent pricing actions. This was partly negated by cost inflation and elevated promotional expenditure.Adjusted EBIT rose 6% to $392 million, driven by reduced adjusted administrative costs, greater adjusted other income and enhanced gross margin.Segment AnalysisMeals & Beverages: Sales at this division dropped 3% year over year to $1,194 million. Further, the segment’s organic sales dropped 3%. Sales were marred by unfavorable timing of U.S. soup shipments. Notably, U.S. soup sales declined 3%, due to adverse movements in retailer inventory levels across broth and condensed soups. Sales of ready-to-serve soups were flat year over year. The segment gained some respite from improvements in Prego pasta sauces. Operating earnings in the Meals & Beverages segment declined 3% to $282 million, due to cost inflation and lower sales.Snacks: Sales at this division rose 2% to $989 million. Organic sales also improved 2%. The segment gained from advancements in Pepperidge Farm cookies, Kettle Brand potato chips, Goldfish crackers, Cape Cod and fresh bakery products. Operating earnings in this category were flat at $125 million as cost-saving efforts and supply-chain productivity plans were offset by elevated marketing and cost inflation.FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with long-term debt of $6,706 million and total equity of $1,249 million. Additionally, the company generated $182 million as net cash from operating activities in the first quarter. Campbell paid out dividends worth $107 million during the first quarter at the rate of 35 cents per share.Other Developments & Fiscal 2020 OutlookDuring the quarter under review, Campbell generated savings worth $45 million as part of its multi-year, cost-saving program, which included synergies associated with the Snyder’s-Lance buyout.

Further, management continues to anticipate cumulative annualized savings from continuing operations of $850 million by fiscal 2022-end.For fiscal 2020, net sales are now projected between a decline of 1% and an increase of 1% compared with the previous guidance of 1-3% growth. Organic sales are also expected in the same range as net sales. Adjusted EBIT is still expected to rise 2-4% and adjusted earnings per share 9-11% to $2.50-$2.55.The guidance for fiscal 2020 takes into consideration gains from an additional 53rd week.
