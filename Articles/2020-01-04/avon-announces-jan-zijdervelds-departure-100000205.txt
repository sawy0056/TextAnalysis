This started with strengthening the brand proposition and driving price improvements.  Reinvesting in Avon's beauty entrepreneurs and launching the digitization of the business, all the while enhancing productivity across the business, transforming its culture and restoring the relevance of this iconic business and brand.A native of The Netherlands who has lived in eight countries on three continents, Mr. Zijderveld joined Avon in February 2018 after a 30-year career at Unilever NV/PLC, during which he was most recently a member of the Unilever Executive Committee and President of Unilever's European business, the company's largest operating business.Avon, by joining a group that includes Natura, The Body Shop and Aesop, will become part of the world's fourth-biggest pure-play beauty company, reaching more than 200 million consumers worldwide through multiple channels.

With the Open Up strategy, we have made significant progress in building a more stable foundation from which Avon can grow well into the future. We have modernized the brand, sharpened the portfolio and brought on-trend, innovative products to our consumers. Most importantly, we have put our passionate representatives back at the heart of everything we do, empowering them to grow their business and reach new consumers. Natura &Co is the right home for Avon to accelerate its Open Up strategy and continue to change women's lives, and I will be cheering from the sidelines."Chan Galbato, chairman of the Board of Directors of Avon, added: "On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our thanks and sincere admiration to Jan for his tremendous accomplishments at Avon's helm and know he will do well in his future endeavors.  The transaction we will soon conclude with Natura &Co is testament to his success in turning around the company through his Open Up strategy.
