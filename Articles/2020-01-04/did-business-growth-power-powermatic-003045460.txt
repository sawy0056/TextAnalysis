But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Powermatic Data Systems Limited (SGX:BCY) share price has soared 218% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 45% over the last quarter. View our latest analysis for Powermatic Data Systems There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Powermatic Data Systems managed to grow its earnings per share at 45% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 26% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 9.38.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).SGX:BCY Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreDive deeper into Powermatic Data Systems's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Powermatic Data Systems's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Powermatic Data Systems the TSR over the last 5 years was 303%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Powermatic Data Systems has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 89% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 32% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
