AT-GAA is a novel treatment paradigm that consists of ATB200, a unique recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) enzyme to enhance uptake, co-administered with AT2221, a pharmacological chaperone. In February 2019, the FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation (“BTD”) to AT-GAA. The candidate is the first-ever investigational product for Pompe disease to receive BTD.The company plans to enhance the body of clinical data for AT-GAA in ongoing clinical studies, including the pivotal phase III PROPEL study. Based on regulatory feedback from both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the PROPEL study is expected to support the approval of the candidate for a broad indication, including ERT-switch and treatment-naïve patients.Further, the company has two gene-therapy programs in the pipeline for two different types of Batten disease.Amicus entered into several partnerships for gene-therapy manufacturing and expansion. In July 2019, it entered into partnerships with Catalent Biologics and Thermo Fisher for clinical and commercial gene-therapy manufacturing. Brammer Bio, a part of Thermo Fisher, will assist Amicus’ gene therapy programs in CLN6 and additional forms of Batten disease with clinical and commercial-scale capabilities. Paragon Gene Therapy, a unit of Catalent Biologics, will provide clinical manufacturing capabilities and capacity for multiple active preclinical lysosomal disorder programs in collaboration with Penn.Amicus has exclusive worldwide rights to Penn’s next-generation gene therapy technologies for a majority of lysosomal disorders and 12 additional rare diseases, including Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, Myotonic Dystrophy and select other muscular dystrophies.However, the company faces substantial competition Several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies currently market and sell products for treating lysosomal storage disorders, including Fabry disease. These products include Sanofi Aventis’ SNY Fabrazyme and Takeda's Replagal plus other Fabry treatment products in development. Additionally, Sanofi markets and sells Myozyme and Lumizyme for the treatment of Pompe disease.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmicus currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesSome better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector are Agenus Inc.
