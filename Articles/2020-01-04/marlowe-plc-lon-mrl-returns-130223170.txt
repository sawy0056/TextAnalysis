Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.First, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Marlowe:0.06 = UK£8.4m ÷ (UK£188m - UK£49m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Marlowe has an ROCE of 6.0%. Check out our latest analysis for Marlowe Does Marlowe Have A Good ROCE?When making comparisons between similar businesses, investors may find ROCE useful. Using our data, Marlowe's ROCE appears to be significantly below the 10% average in the Commercial Services industry. This performance is not ideal, as it suggests the company may not be deploying its capital as effectively as some competitors. Setting aside the industry comparison for now, Marlowe's ROCE is mediocre in absolute terms, considering the risk of investing in stocks versus the safety of a bank account.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Marlowe's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCECurrent liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Marlowe has total assets of UK£188m and current liabilities of UK£49m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 26% of its total assets. It is good to see a restrained amount of current liabilities, as this limits the effect on ROCE.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Marlowe's ROCEIf Marlowe continues to earn an uninspiring ROCE, there may be better places to invest.
