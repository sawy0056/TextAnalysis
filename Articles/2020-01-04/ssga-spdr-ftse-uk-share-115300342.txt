It is made up of 60 portfolio managers, of which 11 are based in London and led by Richard Hannam, senior managing director and head of GEBS EMEA.The portfolio managers may engage in some pre- and postevent trading in connection to particularly large index events. These trading decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and rely on internal forecasts from equity analysts and external brokers. For simpler and/or more-liquid exposures, portfolio managers prefer to trade in line with the index change itself, so as not to incur unnecessary tracking error.SPDR ETFs employ full, sampled, or optimized physical replication. The choice of method depends on several factors, including the size of the portfolio, liquidity of the benchmark constituents, custody costs, tracking error tolerance, and general availability of data. Day-to-day fund management is carried out as a team effort, along with globally consistent processes and practices.SSGA has a global trading function, with desks located in Boston, London, and Hong Kong. All trading is done in-house via an internal 24-hour trading desk. Crossing trades is not permitted within the SPDR UCITS ETFs.Holding nearly 600 stocks, the portfolio is representative of the UK opportunity set, well-diversified, and broad. The index looks well balanced from a stock perspective. HSBC, AstraZeneca, and BP are the three largest index holdings with a 3%-5% weighting each.The constituents of the index are determined quarterly. Top sector exposures include financials and consumer defensive (both 15%-20%), energy (10%-15%), and industrials (9%-11%). Most of the companies in the FTSE All- Share do business in the UK, but the largest holdings have a global reach. As of this writing, most of the revenue is derived from the United States and the UK--about one fourth each--followed by continental Europe (15%-20%) and China (12%-15%). The fund's exposure to revenues from nondeveloped countries is about one fifth of its market value.The fund earns an Above Average rating because it diversifies risk and promotes low turnover.The FTSE All Share is a free-float-adjusted market-cap-weighted index that blankets almost every UK stock.The fund captures the market-cap allocations of the category average well. As of this review, the fund has invested about 65% of its portfolio in large and giant-caps, compared with 61% for the average category peer.The portfolio management team uses an optimised technique to replicate the performance of the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index. Instead of holding all the index's constituents in the same weightings, the fund holds a basket of securities that reflects the risk/reward characteristics of the index.This SPDR FTSE UK All-Share ETF tracks a broad and diversified index that has proved a formidable opponent for active funds to beat. It retained its Morningstar Analyst Rating of Silver.By capturing over 98% of the UK equity market, the FTSE All-Share Index provides broad and representative exposure to UK stocks. With its 20%-25% allocation to mid- and small caps, it offers broader and more-diversified exposure than the better-known but mega-cap-heavy FTSE 100 Index. The FTSE All-Share Index is an adequate representation of the opportunity set available to investors.With an ongoing charge of 0.20%, this fund is very competitively priced relative to the average active fund in its Morningstar Category, but there are cheaper passive offerings available.This fund has outperformed the average peer over the past three- and five-year periods on a risk-adjusted basis.Overall, the FTSE All-Share is the best passive option for UK equity exposure. Its portfolio is well-diversified and captures almost the entire opportunity set, making it a tough opponent to beat. This fund boasts a minimal level of tracking error, and we have a positive view of the portfolio management team.2074 State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) has the structure and leadership in place to serve its fundholders well. Its revamped senior leadership team is finding its footing but is capable of executing the firm's strategy. The firm has shown progress but could do more to bolster its product-development process. SSGA maintains a Neutral Parent rating.Story continuesThe firm continues the upward trajectory set by former CEO Ron O'Hanley in 2015. O'Hanley improved SSGA's investment strategy and risk management governance and will assume the CEO role of State Street Corporation in 2019. His longtime lieutenant Cyrus Taraporevala took over as SSGA's CEO in 2018 and continues to bolster its leadership ranks.SSGA does many things well. Its portfolio management team has been remarkably stable and has a deep bench. The firm also boasts a top-tier stewardship program. More recently, it cut fees on its broad market-cap-weighted offerings and shuttered funds with subpar investment merit. SSGA embraces the custodial banking culture of its parent company, which has a heavy reliance on committees. The firm keeps its clients' interests top of mind, but SSGA's willingness to partner with clients has led to a disjointed fund lineup, and the few funds it has launched under the new regime seem gimmicky. SSGA has yet to show that it can shore up its product development and execute on its broader strategy. State Street continues improving, but its new leadership could strengthen product development. 2018-08-21T09:37:00 2018-08-21T14:37:00Z The fund's risk-adjusted returns over the trailing three- and five-year periods have been above the average peer in the UK large-cap category.When looking at absolute returns only, during the trailing five years through November 2019, the fund's total return has been 0.3% higher than that of the category average. This can be largely attributed to the fund's cost advantage and low turnover.Despite its bias to larger stocks, the fund's three- and five-year standard deviations are like the category average.It's critical to evaluate expenses, as they come directly out of returns. The share class on this report levies a fee that ranks in its Morningstar category's cheapest quintile. Based on our assessment of the fund's People, Process and Parent pillars in the context of these fees, we think this share class will be able to deliver positive alpha relative to the category benchmark index, explaining its Morningstar Analyst Rating of Silver.
