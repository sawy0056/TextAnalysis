Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.A 1.9% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests Kin and Carta has some staying power. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis LSE:KCT Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 267% of Kin and Carta's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. With a cash payout ratio of 90%, Kin and Carta's dividend payments are poorly covered by cash flow. Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Kin and Carta's payments were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we are concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.Is Kin and Carta's Balance Sheet Risky?As Kin and Carta's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 2.22 times its EBITDA, Kin and Carta's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 3.93 times its interest expense, Kin and Carta's interest cover is starting to look a bit thin.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Kin and Carta's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Kin and Carta's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was UK£0.14 in 2010, compared to UK£0.019 last year. The dividend has fallen 86% over that period.Story continuesWe struggle to make a case for buying Kin and Carta for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past ten years.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. Kin and Carta's earnings per share have shrunk at 39% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective, as even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Kin and Carta paid out almost all of its cash flow and profit as dividends, leaving little to reinvest in the business. Earnings per share are down, and Kin and Carta's dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. There are a few too many issues for us to get comfortable with Kin and Carta from a dividend perspective. Businesses can change, but we would struggle to identify why an investor should rely on this stock for their income.Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from costs or inflation. Very few businesses see earnings consistently shrink year after year in perpetuity though, and so it might be worth seeing what the 3 analysts we track are forecasting for the future.Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
