(NYSE:JPM) since 2005. First, this article will compare CEO compensation with compensation at other large companies. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. And finally - as a second measure of performance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. View our latest analysis for JPMorgan Chase How Does Jamie Dimon's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, JPMorgan Chase & Co. has a market capitalization of US$442b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$30m over the year to December 2018. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the salary is lower, valued at US$1.5m. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. When we examined a group of companies with market caps over US$8.0b, we found that their median CEO total compensation was US$11m. (We took a wide range because the CEOs of massive companies tend to be paid similar amounts - even though some are quite a bit bigger than others).It would therefore appear that JPMorgan Chase & Co. pays Jamie Dimon more than the median CEO remuneration at large companies, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. We can get a better idea of how generous the pay is by looking at the performance of the underlying business.You can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at JPMorgan Chase, below.NYSE:JPM CEO Compensation, January 3rd 2020MoreIs JPMorgan Chase & Co.
