United States ruling.The coalition issued the following statement:"Our organizations, representing millions of individuals and families affected by chronic and serious health conditions, are grateful for the swift action taken by 20 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. House of Representatives. Patients cannot afford to endure prolonged uncertainty about the long-term status of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the critical protections it guarantees."While the ACA remains the law of the land, the December appeals court ruling leaves open the possibility that millions of people with pre-existing conditions will one day find themselves without access to the law's important patient protections. It is critical that the Supreme Court takes up this case for review immediately and provides a resolution to this case that threatens the foundational protections our communities rely on."Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down the ACA's individual mandate and remanded the case back to the district court to rule on whether other components of the law, including the future of many key patient protections, remain valid. The petitions filed today request the Supreme Court review the appeals court's decision that the ACA's individual mandate is unconstitutional as well as whether, if it is unconstitutional, the rest of the ACA remains unaffected.ALS Association American Heart Association American Liver Foundation American Lung Association Arthritis Foundation Chronic Disease Coalition Crohn's & Colitis Foundation Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Epilepsy Foundation Hemophilia Federation of AmericaLutheran Services in AmericaMarch of Dimes Muscular Dystrophy Association National Alliance on Mental IllnessNational Coalition for Cancer SurvivorshipNational Health Council National Kidney Foundation National Multiple Sclerosis Society National Organization for Rare DisordersNational Patient Advocate Foundation National Psoriasis Foundation The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society United Way WorldwideWomen Heart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart DiseaseMEDIA CONTACT:Ryan HoleywellThe Leukemia & Lymphoma SocietyRyan.Holeywell@lls.orgCisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/24-patient-groups-endorse-expedited-supreme-court-review-of-affordable-care-act-case-300981000.htmlSOURCE The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextJudge: Military funds for Washington state can't go to wallAssociated PressHouse of Representatives Passes Anti-Lynching Bill Named After Slain Black Teen Emmett TillPeopleHouse committee to explore benefits of blockchain for small businesses next weekThe BlockHouse Democrats to introduce bill clawing back border wall fundsReutersTrump White House Hires a College Student, 23, as a Senior Official: ReportPeopleRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
