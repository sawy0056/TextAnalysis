But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, Marshall Motor Holdings Plc (LON:MMH) shareholders have seen the share price rise 12% over three years, well in excess of the market return (6.8%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 5.4% in the last year , including dividends . See our latest analysis for Marshall Motor Holdings To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over the last three years, Marshall Motor Holdings failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 0.02% (annualized).While EPS is down but the share price is moving up, neither move is particularly drastic, suggesting the market was previously too pessimistic. Still, if EPS declines indefinitely, the share price will likely follow (especially if the company makes a loss).You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).AIM:MMH Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreWe know that Marshall Motor Holdings has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Marshall Motor Holdings, it has a TSR of 28% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveOver the last year Marshall Motor Holdings shareholders have received a TSR of 5.4%. It's always nice to make money but this return falls short of the market return which was about 23% for the year. At least the longer term returns (running at about 8.5% a year, are better. Even the best companies don't see strong share price performance every year. Before forming an opinion on Marshall Motor Holdings you might want to consider the cold hard cash it pays as a dividend.
