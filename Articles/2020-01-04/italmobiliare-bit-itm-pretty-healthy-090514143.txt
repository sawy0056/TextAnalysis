When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Italmobiliare S.p.A. (BIT:ITM) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Italmobiliare How Much Debt Does Italmobiliare Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2019 Italmobiliare had €197.1m of debt, an increase on €223, over one year. However, it does have €462.4m in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of €265.3m.BIT:ITM Historical Debt, January 3rd 2020MoreHow Strong Is Italmobiliare's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Italmobiliare had liabilities of €209.0m falling due within a year, and liabilities of €292.0m due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of €462.4m and €113.5m worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has €74.8m more liquid assets than total liabilities.This surplus suggests that Italmobiliare has a conservative balance sheet, and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Succinctly put, Italmobiliare boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!In fact Italmobiliare's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 58% in the last twelve months. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Italmobiliare can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Italmobiliare has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Italmobiliare recorded negative free cash flow, in total. Debt is usually more expensive, and almost always more risky in the hands of a company with negative free cash flow. Shareholders ought to hope for an improvement.Summing upWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Italmobiliare has net cash of €265.3m, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. So we don't have any problem with Italmobiliare's use of debt. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all.
