This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index.The MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index is designed to address two dimensions of carbon exposure ? carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for CRBN, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.24%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 2.49% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).CRBN's top 10 holdings account for about 11.78% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, CRBN has added roughly 1.12%, and it's up approximately 29.30% in the last one year (as of 01/03/2020). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $104.86 and $130.86.CRBN has a beta of 0.97 and standard deviation of 11.74% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a low risk choice in the space. With about 1387 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market.
