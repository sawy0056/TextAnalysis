(EPA:ELIOR) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 17% in the last month. But that cannot eclipse the less-than-impressive returns over the last three years. After all, the share price is down 39% in the last three years, significantly under-performing the market. View our latest analysis for Elior Group There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Elior Group moved from a loss to profitability. We would usually expect to see the share price rise as a result. So given the share price is down it's worth checking some other metrics too.We think that the revenue decline over three years, at a rate of 4.4% per year, probably had some shareholders looking to sell. After all, if revenue keeps shrinking, it may be difficult to find earnings growth in the future.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).ENXTPA:ELIOR Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreElior Group is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Elior Group will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Elior Group, it has a TSR of -35% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveElior Group shareholders are up 6.2% for the year (even including dividends) . But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 3.6% per year over five year. This suggests the company might be improving over time. Is Elior Group cheap compared to other companies?
