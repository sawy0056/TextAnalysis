(HURC) today reported results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended October 31, 2019. Hurco recorded net income of $2,098,000, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to net income of $8,302,000, or $1.22 per diluted share, for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, Hurco reported net income of $17,495,000, or $2.55 per diluted share, compared to $21,490,000, or $3.15 per diluted share, for fiscal 2018. Sales and service fees for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 were $59,989,000, a decrease of $23,062,000, or 28%, compared to the corresponding prior year period and included an unfavorable currency impact of $1,533,000, or 2%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.  Sales and service fees for fiscal 2019 were $263,377,000, a decrease of $37,294,000, or 12%, compared to fiscal 2018, and included an unfavorable currency impact of $8,492,000, or 3%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.Michael Doar, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Sales in North America were the highest ever recorded for the region, which minimized the impact of the slower cycle we’ve seen in Europe and Asia. While Europe is typically our largest market and Asia is a targeted growth market, we’ve had a measured response to the slowing demand due to decades of experience in this highly-cyclical industry. Our experience, pragmatic fiscal discipline, and an agile corporate structure enable us to use this cycle to invest, acquire, and develop systems and technologies that will promote targeted growth in the future. A key acquisition of an automation company we made during the fourth quarter will help our customers increase productivity and profitability by providing technology that solves the problems that limit their success. Practical automation technology has been elusive for high-mix manufacturing and has lacked the flexibility required by our customers who typically manufacture hundreds of different parts in smaller quantities. Automated machine-tending solutions developed by our new automation group, coupled with collaborative robots and our core control technology, will help these high-mix manufacturing businesses navigate the skills gap, increase manufacturing productivity, and increase their profit margin. We are aware of the down cycle that several markets around the world are experiencing, but we have decided to use this time as an opportunity to promote sustainable growth for Hurco.”The following table sets forth net sales and service fees by geographic region for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):   Three Months Ended   Fiscal Year Ended

Gross profit for fiscal 2019 was $77,208,000, or 29% of sales, compared to $91,806,000, or 31% of sales, for fiscal 2018.  The year-over-year decreases in gross profit as a percentage of sales were primarily due to lower sales of more complex, higher-performance machines in the European sales region, the impact of fixed costs on lower sales and production volume, and competitive pricing pressures on a global basis.Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 were $14,051,000, or 23% of sales, compared to $16,564,000, or 20% of sales, in the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, and included a favorable currency impact of $229,000, when translating foreign expenses to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 were $54,668,000, or 21% of sales, compared to $58,010,000, or 19% of sales, in fiscal 2018, and included a favorable currency impact of $1,466,000, when translating foreign expenses to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.  The year-over-year reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to a decrease in tradeshow expenses associated with IMTS in September 2018, decreased variable employee compensation and other operating expense reductions implemented during fiscal 2019, partially offset by increased operating expenses associated with the U.S. companies acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, respectively.The effective tax rates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 were (14%) and 25%, respectively, compared to 22% and 34% in the corresponding prior year periods. The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 principally resulted from the favorable impact of certain U.S. tax reform provisions available in the current fiscal year, including the full-year impact of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a new deduction attributable to Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) and the benefit of foreign tax credits included in these tax reform provisions.  In addition, the year-over-year changes in the effective tax rates included a shift in geographic mix of income and loss among tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 included one-time charges of $2,894,000 related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in December 2017.Cash and cash equivalents totaled $56,943,000 at October 31, 2019, compared to $77,170,000 at October 31, 2018. Working capital was $207,229,000 at October 31, 2019 compared to $194,632,000 at October 31, 2018.  The increase in working capital was mostly driven by an increase in inventories and a reduction in accounts payable.Hurco Companies, Inc. is an international, industrial technology company that sells its three brands of computer numeric control (“CNC”) machine tools to the worldwide metal cutting and metal forming industry.
