We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. When we examined a selection of companies with market caps ranging from CN¥1.4b to CN¥5.6b, we found the median CEO total compensation was CN¥2.3m.This would give shareholders a good impression of the company, since most similar size companies have to pay more, leaving less for shareholders.
