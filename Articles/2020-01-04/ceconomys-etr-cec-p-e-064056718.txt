Looking back a bit further, we're also happy to report the stock is up 82% in the last year.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. Check out our latest analysis for Ceconomy Does Ceconomy Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?Ceconomy has a P/E ratio of 16.20. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (16.2) for companies in the specialty retail industry is roughly the same as Ceconomy's P/E.XTRA:CEC Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that Ceconomy shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. So if Ceconomy actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price. I would further inform my view by checking insider buying and selling., among other things.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Ceconomy's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 410% last year. And earnings per share have improved by 33% annually, over the last three years. So we'd absolutely expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does Ceconomy's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Ceconomy has net cash of €945m. This is fairly high at 48% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Verdict On Ceconomy's P/E RatioCeconomy has a P/E of 16.2. That's below the average in the DE market, which is 21.3. Not only should the net cash position reduce risk, but the recent growth has been impressive. The below average P/E ratio suggests that market participants don't believe the strong growth will continue. Since analysts are predicting growth will continue, one might expect to see a higher P/E so it may be worth looking closer What we know for sure is that investors have become more excited about Ceconomy recently, since they have pushed its P/E ratio from 12.4 to 16.2 over the last month. If you like to buy stocks that have recently impressed the market, then this one might be a candidate; but if you prefer to invest when there is 'blood in the streets', then you may feel the opportunity has passed.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
