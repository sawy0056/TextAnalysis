The rising need for tight shutoff, light in wieght, high pressure handling capacity with lower installation cost in critical processes, growing demand for energy & power generation in Asia Pacific, increasing adoption of valves in oil & gas industry, and growing urbanization are the major driving factors for the market's growth during the forecast period.Growing industrialization in developing economies, rising use of 3D printing in manufacturing valves, need for valve replacement, and focus of valve manufacturers to offer improved customer service are among the other factors fueling the growth of the triple offset butterfly market. However, lack of standardized certifications and government policies is likely to hinder the growth of the triple offset butterfly market in the future.Burkert Fluid Control Systems (Germany), Emerson (US), Flowserve (US), IMI plc (UK), Curtiss Wright (US), Trillium Flow Technologies (Weir Group) (US), Cameron - Schlumberger (US), Metso Corporation (Finland), Crane Co. (US), KITZ Corporation are among the major players in the triple offset butterfly valve market.Stainless Steel to hold the largest market share during the forecast periodSteel offers efficient mechanical properties and good resistance to stress corrosion and sulfides. Carbon steel offers high- and low-temperature strength. Carbon steel valves can be used in many locations where extreme pressure and extreme temperature make other materials unusable. Carbon steel is used in the manufacturing of various types of triple offset butterfly valves. Also, the rising demand for high-quality triple offset butterfly valves in food & beverages and chemicals industries to mitigate the threat of contamination will drive the market for stainless steel triple offset butterfly valves during the forecast period.>3 to 10 sized triple offset butterfly valves to hold largest markt share during the forecast periodTriple offset butterfly valves sized >3-10 are the most widely manufactured valves; these valves held the largest market share in 2018 and are expected to be the largest share holder during the forecast period also. These valves are selected on the basis of flow pressure, noise, media, and vibration. These valves are mostly used in industries such as chemicals, oil & gas, energy & power, and water & wastewater treatment because of their efficient working mechanisms. Typically, these valves require less maintenance time and are easy to replace.APAC is expected to record the highest growth rate during the forecast periodAPAC is expected to record the highest growth rate during the forecast period. Rapid population growth and urbanization in developing economies, such as China, Japan, South Korea, and India have prompted speedy development of several industries, such as energy & power, water & wastewater treatment, construction, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and oil & gas, which, in turn, will upsurge the demand for triple offset butterfly valves.Key Topics Covered1 Introduction2 Research Methodology3 Executive Summary4 Premium Insights5 Market Overview5.1 Introduction5.2 Market Dynamics5.2.1 Drivers5.2.2 Restraints5.2.3 Opportunities5.2.4 Challenges6 Industry Trends6.1 Introduction6.2 Value Chain Analysis7 Triple Offset Butterfly Valves, By Material7.1 Introduction7.2 Carbon Steel7.3 Stainless Steel 7.4 Alloy Based7.5 Others8 Triple Offset Butterfly Valve Market, By Size8.1 Introduction8.2 Up to 108.3 >10 to 258.4 >25 to 508.5 > 50 9 Triple Offset Butterfly Valves, By Application9.1 Introduction9.2 Oil & Gas9.3 Energy & Power9.4 Water and Wastewater Treatment9.5 Food & Beverages9.6 Metals and Mining9.7 Chemicals9.8 Pharmaceuticals & Healthcare9.9 Building & Construction9.10 Paper and Pulp9.11 Others10 Triple Offset Butterfly Valve Market, By Region10.1 North America10.1.1 US10.1.2 Canada10.1.3 Mexico10.2 Europe10.2.1 UK10.2.2 Germany10.2.3 France10.2.4 Italy10.2.5 Rest of Europe10.3 Asia-Pacific10.3.1 China10.3.2 Japan10.3.3 South Korea10.3.4 India10.3.5 Rest of APAC10.4 RoW10.4.1 South America10.4.2 Middle East10.4.3 Africa11 Competitive Landscape11.1 Introduction 11.2 Market Share Ranking Analysis11.3 Competitive Situation and Trends11.3.1 New Product Launch/Development11.3.2 Mergers & Acquisitions11.3.3 Partnerships/Agreements/Strategic Alliances/Collaborations12 Company Profiles12.1 Emerson12.2 Flowserve Corporation12.3 Curtiss-Wright Corporation12.4 Schlumberger12.5 IMI PLC12.6 Metso12.7 Trillium Flow Technologies12.8 Crane12.9 KITZ Corporation12.10 Velan12.11 Samson Controls12.12 Neway Valve12.13 L&T Valves12.14 Zwick Armaturen12.15 AVK Holdings12.16 Bray International12.17 ABO valve 12.18 Wuzhou Valve Co.12.19 SWI Valve Co.12.20 HOBBS ValveStory continuesFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/mkkrfrResearch and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager press@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOxo’s Airtight Containers Are the Key to an Organized Kitchen — and They’re on SaleCooking LightRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
