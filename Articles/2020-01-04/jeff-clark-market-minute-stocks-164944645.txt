10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers
But – and this is important to understand – we likely won’t see that great performance in the exact same sectors…Semiconductor stocks were the top performers in 2019. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 152%. Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) popped 116% higher. Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) jumped 88%.But, it probably won’t be the big winners of 2019 that lead the market higher this year.Instead, traders should look for the laggards to play catch-up.No doubt, 2019 was a momentum-driven market. Strong stocks got stronger throughout the year. Weak stocks got weaker. And, that trend accelerated in December as institutions and money managers engaged in the art of “window dressing.”They bought more of the market’s best-performing stocks so when they published their holdings at the end of the year, they could show investors they owned the markets best performers. And, they sold off the worst-performing stocks so they could show investors their limited exposure to bad performers.That action has created one of the widest valuation discrepancies between growth stocks and value stocks since 2000.You see, on a relative basis, growth stocks are historically expensive today… and value stocks are historically cheap.AMD, for example, trades at 44 times 2020 earnings estimates. That’s quite richly valued compared to the S&P 500, which trades for about 18 times 2020 earnings estimates.Meanwhile, value stocks like Teva Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:TEVA), which trades at less than 4 times 2020 earnings estimates, are historically cheap.Granted… TEVA has its issues, and the outlook is cloudy. And, AMD is firing on all cylinders and the future is shining bright.But gosh… is AMD really worth ten times the earnings multiple of TEVA – or any other company that actually has earnings?My point is… the valuation gap between growth and value has expanded to a historically wide level. Growth stocks are trading for historically high valuations. Value stocks are historically cheap.If the broad stock market is going to continue higher in 2020, then it’s going to be fueled by a “catch-up” rally in the value stocks. Traders should be looking for the undervalued and underappreciated names of 2019 to lead the market higher this year.Best regards and good trading,Jeff ClarkP.S. If you ask my friend and colleague Teeka Tiwari, there’s another sector that should do very well in 2020…But, it’s not in the stock market.Teeka says that by acting on this idea, you could potentially pay for your whole retirement after one specific day this year.Story continuesIf you’re interested, just click right here and get the story straight from Teeka.
