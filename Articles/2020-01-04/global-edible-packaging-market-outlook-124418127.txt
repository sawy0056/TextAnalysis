This market is also driven by factors such as the ban on single-use plastics, growing environmental and sustainability concerns, increased shelf-life of fresh products without refrigeration, and development of new plant- and microorganism-based sources.The edible packaging market is also influenced by the growing number of manufacturers globally. The key players in this market include Nagase America LLC (US), JRF Technologies (US), Monosol LLC (US), Tipa Corp. (Israel), Avani (Indonesia), Dental Development Systems LLC (US), Evoware (Indonesia), Wikicell Designs (US), Notpla (UK), Devro Plc (UK), Apeel Sciences (US), Coolhaus (US), Do Eat (Belgium) and Mantrose UK Ltd. (UK).The seaweed and algae sources led the market with the largest share in 2019On the basis of raw material, the edible packaging market is classified into seaweed and algae, polysaccharides, lipids, and others, which include surfactants, composites, and carbohydrates. Seaweeds have emerged as a key raw material in edible packaging, which can be attributed to the inherent attributes of seaweeds as an edible source. Seaweeds have high fiber and vitamin content, which aid in the development of seaweed into packaging without the requirement for additional chemical compounds. Given the biodegradable properties of seaweed, it can even be disposed of without any further environmental implications. Seaweed can also be grown with minimal resource support by negating requirements for water, fertilizers, and other key resources.Beverages accounted for the largest share of the edible packaging market in 2019Based on end use, the use of edible packaging in beverages was observed to hold the dominant share in the edible packaging market. Beverages have emerged as a key area for growth in the market. This is primarily driven by water-soluble alternatives to standard plastic packaging. Products including water, juices, and even alcoholic beverages have emerged as the key areas for adoption in the edible packaging landscape. Products such as Ooho have gained widespread popularity among consumers as a water-pod, which can be ingested. Similarly, foodservice outlets are utilizing water-soluble packaging solutions in their everyday operations in an effort to reduce waste.Plant-based edible packaging holds the dominant market share, by sourceOn the basis of source, the plant-based segment is expected to hold the largest market share between 2019 and 2025. Plant-based sources have gained widespread popularity among manufacturers as a reliable source for the development of edible packaging solutions. Different types of plant-based sources, including fibrous vegetables, starch, carbohydrates, and seaweed have emerged as popular sources of edible packaging. Ingredients such as cassava have also been integrated into the process and are viewed as taste-neutral solutions to packaging. Seaweed-based sources have also been adapted into paper-packaging forms and witness widespread acceptance in foodservice industries. High growth is projected in the Asia Pacific edible packaging marketThe Asia Pacific market is projected to be the fastest-growing market for the period considered for this study due to the strong potential for edible packaging solutions, which are being developed in the region. Edible packaging manufacturers see the region as a key launchpad for their offerings, given the growing resistance toward single-use plastics and government reforms toward packaging and waste generation. The region also hosts a strong manufacturing hub for the seaweed industry, which represents a key area for growth in the edible packaging market.Story continuesKey Topics Covered1 Introduction 2 Research Methodology 3 Executive Summary 4 Premium Insights 5 Market Overview 5.1 Introduction5.2 Market Dynamics5.2.1 Drivers5.2.2 Restraints5.2.3 Opportunities5.2.4 Challenges5.3 Regulatory Framework5.4 Patents5.5 Supply Chain/Value Chain6 Edible Packaging Market, By Source 6.1 Introduction6.2 Plant6.3 Animal7 Edible Packaging Market, By Raw Material 7.1 Introduction7.2 Seaweeds and Algae7.3 Polysaccharides7.4 Lipids7.5 Others8 Edible Packaging Market, By End Use 8.1 Introduction8.2 Food8.2.1 Fresh Food8.2.2 Bakery and Confectionery8.2.3 Frozen Foods8.2.4 Others8.3 Beverage8.3.1 Non-Alcoholic Beverages8.3.2 Alcoholic Beverages8.4 Pharmaceuticals9 Edible Packaging Market, By Process Technology 9.1 Introduction9.2 Antimicrobial9.3 Nanotechnology9.4 Electrohydrodynamic9.5 Coatings9.6 Others10 Edible Packaging Market, By Region 10.1 Introduction10.2 North America10.2.1 US10.2.2 Canada10.2.3 Mexico10.3 Europe10.3.1 UK10.3.1 Germany10.3.2 France10.3.3 Italy10.3.4 Spain10.3.5 Rest of Europe10.4 Asia Pacific10.4.1 China10.4.2 India10.4.3 Japan10.4.4 Australia & New Zealand10.4.5 Rest of Asia Pacific10.5 South America10.5.1 Brazil10.5.2 Argentina10.5.3 Rest of South America10.6 RoW10.6.1 The Middle East10.6.2 Africa10 Competitive Landscape 10.1 Overview10.2 Competitive Leadership Mapping11.2.1 Visionary Leaders11.2.2 Innovators11.2.3 Dynamic Differentiators11.2.4 Emerging Companies11.3 Ranking of Key Players, 201811.4 Competitive Scenario11.4.1 New Product Launches and Approvals10.4.2 Expansions & Investments11.4.3 Acquisitions10.4.4 Partnerships, Agreements, and Collaborations11 Company Profiles 11.1 Nagase America LLC11.2 Devro PLC11.3 Monosol LLC11.4 JRF Technology11.5 Evoware11.6 Notpla Ltd.11.7 Tipa Corp.11.8 Avani.11.9 Incredible Foods Inc.11.10 Amtrex Nature Care Pvt.
