But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Gruppo MutuiOnline (BIT:MOL). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. View our latest analysis for Gruppo MutuiOnline Gruppo MutuiOnline's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. As a tree reaches steadily for the sky, Gruppo MutuiOnline's EPS has grown 18% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While Gruppo MutuiOnline did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So it seems the future my hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can stabilize.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Gruppo MutuiOnline with market caps between €358m and €1.4b is about €829k.The Gruppo MutuiOnline CEO received €714k in compensation for the year ending December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add Gruppo MutuiOnline To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Gruppo MutuiOnline has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With swiftly growing earnings, it probably has its best days ahead, and the modest CEO pay suggests the company is careful with cash. So I'd argue this is the kind of stock worth watching, even if it isn't great value today. Of course, just because Gruppo MutuiOnline is growing does not mean it is undervalued.
