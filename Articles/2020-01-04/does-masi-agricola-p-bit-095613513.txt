(BIT:MASI) Have A Place In Your Dividend Stock Portfolio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosIs Masi Agricola S.p.A. (BIT:MASI) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.In this case, Masi Agricola likely looks attractive to dividend investors, given its 3.1% dividend yield and four-year payment history. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Masi Agricola! BIT:MASI Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Masi Agricola paid out 51% of its profit as dividends. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Unfortunately, while Masi Agricola pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Masi Agricola's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Masi Agricola has been paying a dividend for the past four years. The dividend has not fluctuated much, but with a relatively short payment history, we can't be sure this is sustainable across a full market cycle. During the past four-year period, the first annual payment was €0.09 in 2016, compared to €0.10 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.7% a year over that time.It's good to see at least some dividend growth. Yet with a relatively short dividend paying history, we wouldn't want to depend on this dividend too heavily.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Over the past five years, it looks as though Masi Agricola's EPS have declined at around 7.1% a year. Declining earnings per share over a number of years is not a great sign for the dividend investor. Without some improvement, this does not bode well for the long term value of a company's dividend.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. First, we think Masi Agricola has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and the dividend history is shorter than we'd like. Using these criteria, Masi Agricola looks quite suboptimal from a dividend investment perspective.Story continuesAre management backing themselves to deliver performance?
