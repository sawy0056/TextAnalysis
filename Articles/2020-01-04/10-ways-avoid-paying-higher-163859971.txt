Also, a previous version of this story misstated the income level used to determine the Medicare premium paid by a married coupleYou likely don’t have to worry about paying more than the base or standard rate for your Medicare Part B and Part D premiums in 2020.But if you’re a single taxpayer and had modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) in 2018 of more than $87,000, or if you’re a married couple and made more than $174,000 that year, you'll pay the standard premium amount ($144.60 in 2020) plus an extra charge added to your premium: the Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA). Medicare uses your MAGI from two years earlier to determine if you’ll pay that extra charge in 2020.“I hear of so many people who are caught by surprise by the IRMAA,” says Elaine Floyd, director of retirement and life planning at Horsesmouth. “This is really an essential part of tax and retirement planning because it can add thousands of dollars to a person’s or couple’s annual Medicare premiums.”Open enrollment: Are you sure you picked the right coverage?

The Social Security Administration sets the four income brackets that determine your IRMAA.And beginning in 2020, these brackets will be adjusted for inflation, in the same way that COLA is calculated for Social Security, says Jae Oh, the managing principal of GH2 Benefits and the author of "Maximize Your Medicare."But even with that change, the bottom line is this: “The higher your taxable income, the more likely it is you’ll pay Medicare Parts B and D surcharges,” says Katy Votava, president of Goodcare, a firm that helps people plan for and manage health care costs in retirement and author of "Making the Most of Medicare: A Guide for Baby Boomers."Here's how much your standard Part B premium would cost depending on your yearly income in 2018. If you’re subject to IRMAA, there are several steps you can take to avoid or reduce the extra charges added to your Part B and Part D premiums. The key, says Votava, is to maximize your cash flow without increasing taxable income.What should you do?Start earlyOnce you start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs), in most cases starting at age 70½, you have no control over that income, says Floyd. “People with very large IRAs will have large taxable RMDs, and these alone can throw them into IRMAA territory,” she says.Floyd recommends planning ahead by doing Roth IRA conversions early — preferably by age 63 (or two years before starting Medicare if you’re staying on an employer plan after age 65) so the conversion income won’t trigger the IRMAA.Maximize contributions to HSAs An HSA is a type of savings account that lets you reduce your taxable income as well as pay for qualified medical expenses.Take money from your Roth IRADistributions from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Plus, Votava says, those funds can be used for any expense and not increase Medicare surcharges.Consider an HECM  An HECM, or home equity conversion mortgage, is a reverse mortgage insured by the U.S. Federal Government. A HECM allows seniors to convert the equity in their home into tax-free cash flow.Medicare Part B premium 2020: Rates and deductibles rising 7% for outpatient careWatch out: How you could endanger your own 401kLife insurance withdrawals? You might be able to borrow against the accumulated funds or cash value in your whole or permanent life insurance policy to fund living expenses and avoid an increase in your MAGI. Another option: Use a short-term, low-interest loan to reduce your taxable income, says Oh.Use RMDs wisely If you must take an RMD from your retirement accounts and don’t need the money, consider a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) and/or a qualifying longevity annuity contract (QLAC). IRA distributions for charitable contributions as well as the purchase of a QLAC inside an IRA will reduce the taxable RMD in a given year, says Votava.Tax-efficient mutual funds Story continuesYear-end and other distributions from mutual funds increase your taxable income and possibly increase your Medicare premiums, says Oh. Consider investing in funds that avoid such distributions.Annual year-end income projections Remember that the IRMAA tiers are cliff brackets, says Floyd. “If your MAGI is one dollar over, it can throw you into the next tier,” she says.So, for example, if a married couple has MAGI of $174,000, each spouse will pay the base Part B premium of $144.60 in 2020. But if their income is $174,001 or more, they’ll each pay an additional $57.80 for Part B plus $12.20 for Part D.Work with a financial and tax adviser Votava recommends working with your advisers “to see what elements of your retirement plan can be adjusted to limit unnecessary Medicare surcharges.” Additionally, she says, you can plan for those surcharges to limit sticker shock.Appeal the IRMAA Your IRMAA will be based on your income two years prior. For example, 2020 Medicare premiums will be based on income reported on 2018 tax returns, says Floyd. “If you have stopped working and your income will be lower than the amount shown on the tax return used to figure the IRMAA, you can appeal using Form SSA-44. Robert Powell is the editor of TheStreet’s Retirement Daily www.retirement.thestreet.com and contributes regularly to USA TODAY.
