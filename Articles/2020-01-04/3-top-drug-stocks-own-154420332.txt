In late July, PFE plunged 21% on company plans to combine its blockbuster drug-selling unit with Mylan (NYSE:MYL), and announced it was cutting its sales and adjusted earnings forecast.However, with a strong drug portfolio, acquisitions, and an undervalued stock, PFE is attracting interest once again. The company also just raised its dividend by 5.6%, which brings the new quarterly dividend to 38 cents from 36 cents payable March 6, 2020 to shareholders as of Jan. 31.Plus, “the valuation on new Pfizer looks appealing, given management’s expectation of 6% annualized sales growth through 2025, which could produce 10%-plus yearly gains in earnings per share. New Pfizer has important patent-protected drugs like Ibrance for breast cancer and the pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, plus a strong pipeline,” notes Barron’s contributor Andrew Bary.As of this writing, Ian Cooper did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace
