The bad news is that even after that recovery shareholders are still underwater by about 8.6% for the full year.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. View our latest analysis for Medifast How Does Medifast's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?Medifast's P/E is 17.91. The image below shows that Medifast has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the personal products industry average (17.8).NYSE:MED Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that Medifast shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. Checking factors such as director buying and selling. could help you form your own view on if that will happen.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Medifast's 58% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. The cherry on top is that the five year growth rate was an impressive 25% per year. So I'd be surprised if the P/E ratio was not above average.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Is Debt Impacting Medifast's P/E?Medifast has net cash of US$97m. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.The Verdict On Medifast's P/E RatioMedifast has a P/E of 17.9. That's around the same as the average in the US market, which is 18.9. The excess cash it carries is the gravy on top its fast EPS growth. So based on this analysis we'd expect Medifast to have a higher P/E ratio.
