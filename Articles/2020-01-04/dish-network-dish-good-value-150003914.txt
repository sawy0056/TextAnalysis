After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put DISH Network Corporation DISH stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, DISH Network has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.01, as you can see in the chart below:View photos This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.33. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, DISH Network’s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 18.66 over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. However, the current level stands significantly below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.View photos Moreover, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Market sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.56. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.View photosStory continues We should also point out that DISH Network has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 17.82, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, DISH Network has a P/S ratio of about 1.49. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.52 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.View photos Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, DISH Network currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes DISH Network a solid choice for value investors.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.31, which is better than the industry average of 7.48. Clearly, DISH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though DISH Network might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and Momentum Score of D. This gives DISH a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C.
