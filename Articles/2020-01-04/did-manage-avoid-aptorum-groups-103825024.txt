But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the Aptorum Group Limited (NASDAQ:APM) share price is down 13% in the last year. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 34%. Aptorum Group may have better days ahead, of course; we've only looked at a one year period. It's down 15% in about a quarter. View our latest analysis for Aptorum Group We don't think Aptorum Group's revenue of US$596,580 is enough to establish significant demand. This state of affairs suggests that venture capitalists won't provide funds on attractive terms. As a result, we think it's unlikely shareholders are paying much attention to current revenue, but rather speculating on growth in the years to come. It seems likely some shareholders believe that Aptorum Group has the funding to invent a new product before too long.As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. You should be aware that there is always a chance that this sort of company will need to issue more shares to raise money to continue pursuing its business plan. While some companies like this go on to deliver on their plan, making good money for shareholders, many end in painful losses and eventual de-listing.Aptorum Group had cash in excess of all liabilities of just US$5.4m when it last reported (June 2019). So if it hasn't remedied the situation already, it will almost certainly have to raise more capital soon. With that in mind, you can understand why the share price dropped 13% in the last year .

There's no way to know its value easily. Given that situation, would you be concerned if it turned out insiders were relentlessly selling stock? I would feel more nervous about the company if that were so. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.A Different PerspectiveGiven that the market gained 34% in the last year, Aptorum Group shareholders might be miffed that they lost 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. It's worth noting that the last three months did the real damage, with a 15% decline. This probably signals that the business has recently disappointed shareholders - it will take time to win them back.
