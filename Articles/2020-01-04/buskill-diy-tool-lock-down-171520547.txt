But what if – after you’ve carefully authenticated – someone snatch-and-runs with your laptop?” wrote Atfield. “Maybe you can call your bank to freeze your accounts before they’ve done significant financial harm. Maybe you can’t.”Replace “bank” with “decentralized exchange” in this scenario and you get a general idea of this tool’s value.The system works by watching your USB ports for a certain brand of USB key. Atfield uses a magnetic breakaway cable that would disconnect if someone pulled the laptop away from him and then wrote some simple code that works on Linux or Mac OS to trigger an action when the USB key suddenly disappears. In other words, when the cable is yanked away, the computer will lock itself down.A magnetic USB cable.

Further, we can imagine far less controlled situations in which someone drags your laptop off a cafe table and runs off into a crowd.Ultimately, a little opsec like this might suggest paranoia, but, as William S. Burroughs said, “Sometimes paranoia’s just having all the facts.”ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
