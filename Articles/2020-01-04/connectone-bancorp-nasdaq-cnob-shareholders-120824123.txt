Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market Unfortunately for shareholders, while the ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNOB) share price is up 39% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Some buyers are laughing, though, with an increase of 38% in the last year. See our latest analysis for ConnectOne Bancorp While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, ConnectOne Bancorp managed to grow its earnings per share at 21% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 6.9% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).NasdaqGS:CNOB Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, ConnectOne Bancorp's TSR for the last 5 years was 50%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that ConnectOne Bancorp shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 41% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 8.4%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
