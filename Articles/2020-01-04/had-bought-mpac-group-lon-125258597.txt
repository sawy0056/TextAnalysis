But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. To wit, the Mpac Group plc (LON:MPAC) share price has flown 260% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! It's also up 20% in about a month. See our latest analysis for Mpac Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the three years of share price growth, Mpac Group actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 44% per year.Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Given this situation, it makes sense to look at other metrics too.It may well be that Mpac Group revenue growth rate of 9.8% over three years has convinced shareholders to believe in a brighter future. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).AIM:MPAC Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at Mpac Group's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered Mpac Group's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Mpac Group shareholders, and that cash payout contributed to why its TSR of 260%, over the last 3 years, is better than the share price return.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Mpac Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 86% over one year. That's better than the annualised return of 23% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
