And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. See our latest analysis for Best Buy Best Buy's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. As a tree reaches steadily for the sky, Best Buy's EPS has grown 20% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). Best Buy reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. That's not bad, but it doesn't point to ongoing future growth, either.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Best Buy?Are Best Buy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Best Buy has a market capitalization of US$23b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$2.5b. This suggests to me that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Best Buy, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$11m.The Best Buy CEO received US$5.9m in compensation for the year ending February 2019. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add Best Buy To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Best Buy has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. Each to their own, but I think all this makes Best Buy look rather interesting indeed. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Best Buy by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.Story continuesAlthough Best Buy certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
