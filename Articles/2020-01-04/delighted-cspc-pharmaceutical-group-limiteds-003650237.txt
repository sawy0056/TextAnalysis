We'll use ROE to examine CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited (HKG:1093), by way of a worked example.Over the last twelve months CSPC Pharmaceutical Group has recorded a ROE of 22%. Another way to think of that is that for every HK$1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn HK$0.22. See our latest analysis for CSPC Pharmaceutical Group How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for CSPC Pharmaceutical Group:22% = CN¥3.9b ÷ CN¥18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does ROE Signify?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, CSPC Pharmaceutical Group has a superior ROE than the average (13%) company in the Pharmaceuticals industry.SEHK:1093 Past Revenue and Net Income, January 3rd 2020MoreThat's clearly a positive. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example, I often check if insiders have been buying shares.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining CSPC Pharmaceutical Group's Debt And Its 22% Return On EquityWhile CSPC Pharmaceutical Group does have a tiny amount of debt, with debt to equity of just 0.0046, we think the use of debt is very modest. Its ROE is very impressive, and given only modest debt, this suggests the business is high quality. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Story continuesHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
