We'll look at Ucar SA's (EPA:ALUCR) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Ucar has a P/E ratio of 37.61, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.7%. View our latest analysis for Ucar How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Ucar:P/E of 37.61 = €15.10 ÷ €0.40 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each €1 of company earnings. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does Ucar Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. The image below shows that Ucar has a significantly higher P/E than the average (11.2) P/E for companies in the transportation industry.ENXTPA:ALUCR Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Ucar will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.Ucar saw earnings per share decrease by 21% last year. And EPS is down 11% a year, over the last 5 years. This could justify a pessimistic P/E.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Ucar's Balance SheetSince Ucar holds net cash of €278k, it can spend on growth, justifying a higher P/E ratio than otherwise.The Verdict On Ucar's P/E RatioUcar's P/E is 37.6 which is above average (18.2) in its market. The recent drop in earnings per share might keep value investors away, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: and the high P/E suggests the market thinks it will.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is better than it expects, you can make money by buying and holding for the long term.
