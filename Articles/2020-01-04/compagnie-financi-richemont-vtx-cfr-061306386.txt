Of course, the aim of the game is to pick stocks that do better than an index fund. Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (VTX:CFR) has done well over the last year, with the stock price up 24% beating the market return of 24% (not including dividends). However, the longer term returns haven't been so impressive, with the stock up just 15% in the last three years. Check out our latest analysis for Compagnie Financière Richemont In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last year, Compagnie Financière Richemont actually saw its earnings per share drop 44%.So we don't think that investors are paying too much attention to EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.However the year on year revenue growth of 19% would help. Many businesses do go through a phase where they have to forgo some profits to drive business development, and sometimes its for the best.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SWX:CFR Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreCompagnie Financière Richemont is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Compagnie Financière Richemont in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Compagnie Financière Richemont the TSR over the last year was 27%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveCompagnie Financière Richemont provided a TSR of 27% over the year (including dividends) . That's fairly close to the broader market return. To take a positive view, the gain is pleasing, and it sure beats annualized TSR loss of 0.9%, which was endured over half a decade. We're pretty skeptical of turnaround stories, but it's good to see the recent share price recovery. Is Compagnie Financière Richemont cheap compared to other companies?
