The recent drop has obliterated the annual return, with the share price now down 9.7% over that longer period. At least the stock is still up slightly on where it was at the start of the quarter.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. See our latest analysis for Canterbury Park Holding How Does Canterbury Park Holding's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?Canterbury Park Holding's P/E of 12.63 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock.

Since the market seems unimpressed with Canterbury Park Holding, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.Canterbury Park Holding's earnings per share fell by 16% in the last twelve months. But it has grown its earnings per share by 18% per year over the last five years. And EPS is down 1.7% a year, over the last 3 years. This growth rate might warrant a low P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does Canterbury Park Holding's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals just 0.5% of Canterbury Park Holding's market cap. It would probably trade on a higher P/E ratio if it had a lot of cash, but I doubt it is having a big impact.The Verdict On Canterbury Park Holding's P/E RatioCanterbury Park Holding's P/E is 12.6 which is below average (18.9) in the US market. Since it only carries a modest debt load, it's likely the low expectations implied by the P/E ratio arise from the lack of recent earnings growth. Given Canterbury Park Holding's P/E ratio has declined from 12.6 to 12.6 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is less confident about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
