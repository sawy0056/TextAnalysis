There are no other changes to the information previously provided on December 31, 2019 .Each of the ETFs is required to distribute any net income and capital gains that they have earned in the year. The annual Non-Cash Distributions will not be paid in cash but will be reinvested and reported as taxable distributions and will be used to increase each unitholder's adjusted cost base for the respective ETF. The nature of the Non-Cash Distributions for the respective ETFs as either income or capital gains is disclosed in the footnotes to the table below. The Non-Cash Distributions will be reinvested automatically in additional units of the respective ETFs and immediately consolidated so that the number of units held by the unitholder, the units outstanding of the ETFs, and the net asset value of the ETFs, will not change as a result of the Non-Cash Distributions. These amounts do not include the regular monthly or quarterly cash distributions, as applicable, announced on December 20, 2019 .The ex-dividend date for these distributions was December 30, 2019 , for all unitholders of record on December 31, 2019 . The nominal payment date applied to these Non-Cash Distributions will be January 13, 2020 , though in actuality there will be no physical payment made as would be the case with cash distributions. In early 2020, the tax characteristics of all distributions for 2019 for the ETFs will be reported to brokers via the CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. ("CDS") and will be posted on our website shortly thereafter.
