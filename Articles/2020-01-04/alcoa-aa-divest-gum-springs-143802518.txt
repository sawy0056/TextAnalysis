Notably, the deal is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, and projected to close in the first quarter of 2020.The deal, worth about $250 million in total consideration, includes $200 million in cash for the sale of Alcoa’s business unit, Elemental Environmental Solutions, and another $50 million, conditioned upon the fulfillment of certain post-closing conditions.Details of the Divestment DealAs part of Alcoa’s Elemental Environmental Solutions business, the 1,300-acre waste treatment facility in Gum Springs is engaged in several environmental management processes that include the usage of two hazardous waste incinerators as well as a landfill. Notably, the facility has also processed spent pot lining for the smelter industry in North America. It is worth mentioning here that the deal comprises a multi-year agreement, per which Veolia will remain a key service provider for Alcoa.As noted, the deal is in sync with Alcoa’s strategy of divesting non-core assets, with a target of generating $500 million-$1 billion in cash. In fact, the deal will enable the company to emphasize on its core business.Existing Business ScenarioAlcoa’s long-term debt, in the last three years (2016-2018), increased 8.1% (CAGR). Notably, at the end of third-quarter 2019, the company’s long-term debt was $1,805 million, up 0.2% from 2018-end.
