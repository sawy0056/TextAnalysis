The yuan traded slightly higher earlier in the day following news that China’s central bank again loosened its monetary stance and cut its reserve requirement ratio to lift its economy.The GBP/USD pair fell 0.3% to 1.3107 amid concern that the U.K. won’t be able to reach a free-trade agreement with the European Union by the deadline at the end of this year.Meanwhile, the EUR/USD pair slipped 0.1% to 1.1165 as data showed the region’s manufacturing downturn deepened in December.
