Last year’s breathtaking December correction was followed by the record-breaking comeback rally. The late October – early November breakout led to another leg higher, as the S&P 500 index broke above the 3,200 mark. But will the rally continue? If the market goes higher, which stocks are going to beat the index? And if it reverses down from here, which stocks are about to outperform on the short side?We will provide stock trading ideas based on our in-depth technical and fundamental analysis, but since the main point of this publication is to provide the top 5 long and top 5 short candidates (our opinion, not an investment advice) for this week, we will focus solely on the technicals. The latter are simply more useful in case of short-term trades.We will assume the following: the stocks will be bought or sold short on the opening of today’s trading session (January 2) and sold or bought back on the closing of the next Tuesday’s trading session (January 7).First, we will take a look at the recent performance by sector. It may show us which sector is likely to perform best in the near future and which sector is likely to lag. Then, we will select our buy and sell stock picks.There are eleven stock market sectors: Energy, Materials, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Financials, Technology, Communications Services, Utilities and Real Estate. They are further divided into industries, but we will just stick with these main sectors of the stock market.We will analyze them and their relative performance by looking at the Select Sector SPDR ETF’s.Let’s start with our first charts (charts courtesy of www.stockcharts.com).View photosStory continuesView photosThere’s a S&P 500’s 30-minute chart along with market sector indicators for the past month. The S&P 500 index has gained 2.86% since December 2. The strongest sector was Consumer Staples XLE, as it gained 6.03%. The Technology XLK gained 4.32% and the Health Care XLV gained 3.47%.On the other hand, the weakest sector was Industrials XLI, as it lost 0.2%. The Real Estate XLRE gained just 1.14% and Communication Services XLC gained 2.26% in the last 30 days.However, the Real Estate XLRE trades within a strongest short-term uptrend, and the Financials XLF is the weakest in the short-termBased on the above, we decided to choose our stock picks for the next week. We will choose our top 3 long and top 3 short candidates using a contrarian approach, and top 2 long and top 2 short candidates using the trend-following approach:Contrarian approach (betting against the recent trend): • buys: 2 x Industrials, 1 x Communication Services • sells: 1 x Consumer Staples, 1 x Technology, 1 x Real EstateTrend-following approach: • buys: 1 x Consumer Staples, 1 x Technology • sells: 1 x Industrials, 1 x Communication ServicesContrarian approach Top 3 Buy CandidatesGD General Dynamics Corp. – IndustrialsView photosThe GD stock trades at its early December local low. Furthermore, there is a potential support level at around $172-174, marked by October local lows. On the other hand, the resistance level is at $180.CHRW C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. – Industrials View photosThe C. H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. stock is our long pick again. The market broke above its month-long downward trend line recently. For now, it looks like a correction within a medium-term downtrend. However, we could see an attempt at retracing more of the late October sell-off.CTL CenturyLink, Inc. – Communication ServicesView photosCTL stock remains within a short-term consolidation. The market is at September’s local high that’s acting as a support level. We may see an attempt at retracing some of the declines.We hope you enjoyed reading the above free analysis, and we encourage you to read today’s Stock Pick Update – this analysis’ full version.
