This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Marks and Spencer Group plc (LON:MKS), by way of a worked example.Over the last twelve months Marks and Spencer Group has recorded a ROE of 3.0%. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each £1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made £0.03 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Marks and Spencer Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Marks and Spencer Group:3.0% = UK£94m ÷ UK£3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does Return On Equity Signify?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Marks and Spencer Group Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Marks and Spencer Group has a lower ROE than the average (18%) in the Multiline Retail industry classification.LSE:MKS Past Revenue and Net Income, January 3rd 2020MoreUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. It is better when the ROE is above industry average, but a low one doesn't necessarily mean the business is overpriced. Nonetheless, it could be useful to double-check if insiders have sold shares recently.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining Marks and Spencer Group's Debt And Its 3.0% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the significant use of debt by Marks and Spencer Group, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.44. The company doesn't have a bad ROE, but it is less than ideal tht it has had to use debt to achieve its returns. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.But It's Just One MetricReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
