Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE.

And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Medistim:0.42 = kr98m ÷ (kr282m - kr52m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Medistim has an ROCE of 42%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Medistim.Do Medistim's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Short term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Medistim has total assets of kr282m and current liabilities of kr52m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 18% of its total assets. The fairly low level of current liabilities won't have much impact on the already great ROCE.What We Can Learn From Medistim's ROCEWith low current liabilities and a high ROCE, Medistim could be worthy of further investigation.
