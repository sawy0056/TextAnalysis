Just one day into 2020, the Global X sector fund is making a case for the spectacular category.CHIX follows the MSCI China Financials 10/50 Index. That index provides exposure to large- and mid-cap Chinese financial services firms. The CHIX index “incorporates all eligible securities as per MSCI’s Global Investable Market Index Methodology, including China A, B, and H shares, Red chips, P chips, and foreign listings, among others,” according to Global X.CHIX surged 3% on Thursday thanks to some help from the People's Bank of China (PBOC), that country's central bank.PBOC “said on Wednesday it was cutting the amount of cash that all banks must hold as reserves, releasing around 800 billion yuan ($114.91 billion) in funds to shore up the slowing economy,” reports Reuters.Call On CHIXBeijing has had to respond to changing global conditions with increased central bank policies. As trade barriers go up, authorities can no longer rely on foreign investment or exports that have previously supported the country’s growth for so long. Consequently, policymakers believe it is more efficient to focus on a domestically-oriented economy.“China’s national government and Central Bank support key industries through monetary policy, fiscal policy, and regulation. Most recently, the central bank sought to support economic growth by lowering bank reserve requirements and interest rates to support the Financials sector (CHIX),” according to recent research by Global X.With CHIX, investors can access financial services sector growth at a discount relative to equivalent domestic ETFs. Due to previous fears about instability in the Chinese banking system, many of which have yet to materialize, banks in the world’s second-largest economy trade at depressed valuations relative to their U.S. counterparts.“Freeing up more liquidity now would also reduce the risks of a credit crunch ahead of the long Lunar New Year holidays later this month when demand for cash surges. Record debt defaults and problems at some smaller banks have already added to strains on China’s financial system,” according to Reuters.For more thematic investing trends, visit our Thematic Investing Channel.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Are Chipmakers’ Massive Gains Becoming Too Frothy?BKLN: Modest Yield, High RiskFedEx Barks Back At Amazon Over Shipping LimitationsBed Bath & Beyond Does Some Holiday CleaningGold Likely to Shine Brighter in 2020, Says World Gold CouncilREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; WHO Sees ‘Decisive’ Stage: Virus UpdateBloombergAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersInvestors in Asia Still Betting Markets Will End Higher in 2020BloombergGlobal coronavirus cases rise as China’s downward trend continuesPA Media: World NewsRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
