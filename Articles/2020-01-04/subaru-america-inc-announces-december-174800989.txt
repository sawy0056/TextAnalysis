Milestones achieved in 2019 include the sale of the 2-millionth Forester, as well as the 10-millionth Subaru sold in the U.S."2019 marked the 12th straight year of sales increases and 11th consecutive year of record sales for the Subaru franchise in the U.S.," said Thomas J. Doll, President and CEO of Subaru of America, Inc. "We would like to thank our retailers, distributors and employees for making these record-breaking sales results possible. The soul of Subaru shines most strongly during our annual Subaru Share the Love® Event, which since its inception in 2008, will have contributed more than $170 million to charities that reinforce our mission to make the world a better place.""We are pleased to close December and 2019 with strong sales and steady growth, despite an increasingly competitive auto industry," said Jeff Walters, Senior Vice President of Sales. "In 2019, Outback was our top selling model, Forester had its best year ever, and the Ascent saw a triple-digit sales increase, reflecting the continued strength of our product portfolio. With the enduring support of our retailer network, we look forward to continued success in 2020." Carline
