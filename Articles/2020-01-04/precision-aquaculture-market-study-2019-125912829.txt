These players adopt various strategies, such as product developments, mergers, partnerships, collaborations, and expansions, to cater to customer demands.Market for underwater ROVs estimated to grow at highest CAGR during forecast periodThe market for underwater ROVs is expected to grow at the highest CAGR from 2019 to 2024 due to substantial cost savings associated with this technology, and the rising number of aquaculture farms in the European and South American regions. Underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are expected to witness high growth rate in the years to come. Underwater ROVs adoption trend in Western Europe and North America have gained good traction in recent years. Currently, more than 60% of underwater ROVs installed bases come from countries such as the US, Canada, Norway, and Chile.Market for aquaculture monitoring & survelliance application to grow at highest CAGR during forecast periodThe precision aquaculture market for the aquaculture monitoring & survelliance application is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The high growth in this segment is predominantly driven by the increasing adoption of hardware devices such as sensors, RFID tags & readers, and livestock collars for the early detection of diseases in livestock, management of the herd, and identification and tracking of livestock. Precision aquaculture market in South America to grow at highest CAGR from 2019 to 2024The increasing automation of aquaculture farms in countries such as Brazil and Chile is a major factor driving the precision aquaculture market in South America. Increasing demand for protein rich aqua food is mounting pressure on the suppliers of aquaculture products to become more efficient and productive, pushing the sales of aquaculture technology upward. The precision aquaculture market in South America is in its early growth phase and is expected to grow rapidly until 2024.
