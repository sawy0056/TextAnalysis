With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Elis’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Elis What's the opportunity in Elis?Good news, investors! Elis is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is €32.72, but it is currently trading at €18.67 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Elis’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from Elis?ENXTPA:ELIS Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 63% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Elis. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder?
