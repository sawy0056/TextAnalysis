Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Asia Standard Hotel Group:0.067 = HK$628m ÷ (HK$11b - HK$1.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Asia Standard Hotel Group has an ROCE of 6.7%.

You can check if Asia Standard Hotel Group has cyclical profits by looking at this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.How Asia Standard Hotel Group's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCECurrent liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Asia Standard Hotel Group has total liabilities of HK$1.7b and total assets of HK$11b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 15% of its total assets. This very reasonable level of current liabilities would not boost the ROCE by much.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Asia Standard Hotel Group's ROCEIf Asia Standard Hotel Group continues to earn an uninspiring ROCE, there may be better places to invest.
