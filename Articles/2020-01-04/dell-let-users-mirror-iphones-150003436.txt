Previously, people using Mobile Connect with an iPhone were only able to get notifications and send texts. Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusMoreNew Feature to Boost SalesThe feature is expected to make Dell’s laptops more attractive to iPhone users and thus improve its sales.Although Apple has offered deep integration between its Mac computers and iPhones for years, including easy file transfers, messaging and calls, it does not offer a screen mirroring feature.Apple iPhones have a huge installed base and tapping into it will be a significant boost to Dell’s growth efforts.Notably, iPhones had an active installed base of 900 million units at the start of 2019 and the number is likely to have gone up during the year.Strengthening Competitive PositionThe new feature is also expected to give Dell a competitive edge in the highly competitive PC market, which is currently dominated by the likes of Lenovo and Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.Per Gartner data, as of second-quarter 2019, Lenovo and HP had a market share of 25% and 22.2%, respectively, with Dell at the third place with a market share of 16.9%.Dell’s market share increased after winning several commercial contracts for its desktops and workstations.Notably, in third-quarter fiscal 2020, the company witnessed double-digit growth in the number of commercial units sold, with commercial revenues growing 9% year over year to $8.3 billion.Further, Dell partnered with Alphabet’s GOOGL Google division in 2019 to launch new Chromebook models. This has allowed it to gain a foothold in the low-end PC market.Zacks Rank Dell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity.
