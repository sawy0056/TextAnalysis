our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. The company has been paying a stable dividend for a few years now, but we'd like to see more evidence of consistency over a longer period. During the past two-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.20 in 2018, compared to US$0.44 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 48% a year over that time.MetroCity Bankshares has been growing its dividend quite rapidly, which is exciting.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see MetroCity Bankshares has grown its earnings per share at 30% per annum over the past five years. The company is only paying out a fraction of its earnings as dividends, and in the past been able to use the retained earnings to grow its profits rapidly - an ideal combination.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that MetroCity Bankshares's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. We like that MetroCity Bankshares has a low and conservative payout ratio.Overall we think MetroCity Bankshares is an interesting dividend stock, although it could be better.Story continuesSee if management have their own wealth at stake, by checking insider shareholdings in MetroCity Bankshares stock.Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
