View our latest analysis for Vinda International Holdings How Do I Calculate Vinda International Holdings's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Vinda International Holdings:P/E of 25.64 = HK$14.42 ÷ HK$0.56 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each HK$1 of company earnings.

Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Vinda International Holdings saw earnings per share decrease by 6.4% last year. But EPS is up 3.1% over the last 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does Vinda International Holdings's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals 25% of Vinda International Holdings's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Bottom Line On Vinda International Holdings's P/E RatioVinda International Holdings has a P/E of 25.6. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 10.7. With a bit of debt, but a lack of recent growth, it's safe to say the market is expecting improved profit performance from the company, in the next few years.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
