In August last year the military said it had foiled a Quds Force attack, administered by Soleimani, involving multiple drones from Syria.And Israel accused him of leading Quds Force efforts to establish a precision-guided missiles programme for Hezbollah.Israeli media commentators said that ministers in Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government had been asked not to comment publicly on Soleimani's killing."The goal is clear: not to unnecessarily complicate Israel and keep the message as unified as possible," said Dana Weiss, chief political analyst for Israel's Channel 12 news.But Yair Lapid, an opposition lawmaker, congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump on Twitter for killing those responsible for "murderous terrorist acts from Damascus to Buenos Aires" and that Soleimani's "blood is forfeit."Hamas said Soleimani "had a senior role in supporting Palestinian resistance in all fields". It extended "its dearest condolences to the Iranian leadership and the people of Iran at the martyrdom of Major General Qassem Soleimani."Gaza-based Hamas official Bassem Naim wrote on Twitter that the assassination "opens the doors of the region to all possibilities, except calm & stability. USA bears the responsibility for that.” (Writing by Stephen Farrell.
