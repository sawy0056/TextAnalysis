These factors are projected to drive the growth of the global tea extracts market.The conventional segment, by category, is estimated to be the largest segment in tea extracts market during the forecast period.Tea extracts are manufactured either organically or through conventional methods. Natural fertilizers and compost are used to produce tea extracts organically, while extensive chemical treatment using chemical fertilizers are adopted for conventional tea extracts. Conventional tea extracts are produced commercially, unlike organic extracts, which are produced by small-scale producers; hence, organically produced tea extracts are priced at a premium rate, which affects their demand. Organic, being a recent trend, is still at its nascent stage, and hence, the conventional category segment dominated the global market.The beverages segment, by application, is projected to witness the fastest growth in the market during the forecast period.The trend toward healthy eating has increased the demand for convenient and healthy options for food & beverages among consumers. Manufacturers have been incorporating innovative flavors in their ready-to-drink beverage products, such as peach, lemon, honey, pomegranate, mint, and several herbal flavors, to cater to consumer demand. The growing demand for RTD tea in the global beverage segment has been creating opportunities for the market in the beverage industry.North America is estimated to account for the largest market share due to the high demand for tea extracts from the US. The increase in obesity cases and heart attacks has led consumers to switch to antioxidants and anti-inflammatory food and beverage products. Botanical extracts are being increasingly used among US consumers in their daily diets, with a view to derive multiple health benefits and lead healthy lifestyle. Since a majority of the US population consume tea, this flavor is being used by the US food & beverage industry for their innovative products in the form of extracts. The rise in popularity of functional foods and switch from the traditional source of nutrients are major propellants of the tea extracts market in the region.Key Topics Covered1 Introduction2 Research Methodology3 Executive Summary 4 Premium Insights5 Market Overview5.1.
