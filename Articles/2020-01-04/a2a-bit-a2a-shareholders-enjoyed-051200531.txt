But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term A2A S.p.A. (BIT:A2A) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 103% in five years. See our latest analysis for A2A To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last half decade, A2A became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).BIT:A2A Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreDive deeper into A2A's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of A2A's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for A2A the TSR over the last 5 years was 144%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveA2A provided a TSR of 9.3% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 20% per year for five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at A2A's dividend track record.
