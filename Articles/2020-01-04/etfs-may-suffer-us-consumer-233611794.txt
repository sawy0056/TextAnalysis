However, analysts believe that the key confidence measure is at a decent level.In this regard, Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators of the Conference Board, said that, "while the economy hasn't shown signs of further weakening, there is little to suggest that growth, and in particular consumer spending, will gain momentum in early 2020” (read: Top-Ranked ETFs, Stocks From Top Sector of the Last Decade).A Sneak Peek Into the NumbersFor December 2019, the Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence index stands at 126.5, below the upwardly revised reading of 126.8 in November (from 125.5 originally). However, December’s reading missed the consensus estimate of 128.2, per a Reuters’ poll.The Present Situation Index, which gauges consumer views on current market conditions, climbed from 166.6 to 170.0. However, the Expectations Index, which is a measure of consumers’ short-term (for the next six months) outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, dropped from 100.3 in November to 97.4  in December.The latest data shows the percentage of consumers assessing that business conditions are “good” remained virtually unchanged at 38.7%. Meanwhile, those judging the conditions were “bad” declined to 11.1% from 13.6%. Interestingly, the percentage of people claiming jobs were “plentiful” and the percentage of those stating jobs were “hard to get,” both marginally rose to 47% and 13.1%, respectively. However, there was a rise in the percentage of consumers expecting lesser jobs and lower income.Looking ForwardThe signing of the Sino-U.S. phase-one trade deal on Jan 15, 2019 might help improve consumer confidence. Per a Mastercard Spending Pulse survey, holiday sales increased 3.4% year over year. Moreover, there was an 18.8% year-over-year rise in online sales, highlighting the change in consumer’s shopping pattern. The survey tracked sales from Nov 1 through Dec 24.Therefore, given Fed’s lower interest rate and improving domestic economy along with improving Sino-U.S. trade ties, there are chances that consumer confidence will improve over time.ETFs in FocusThe combination of these factors is expected to have an impact on the consumer discretionary sector, which attracts a major portion of consumer spending.
