With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine MYR Group Inc. (NASDAQ:MYRG), by way of a worked example.Over the last twelve months MYR Group has recorded a ROE of 9.8%. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated $0.10 in profit. See our latest analysis for MYR Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for MYR Group:9.8% = US$34m ÷ US$351m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does MYR Group Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see MYR Group has a similar ROE to the average in the Construction industry classification (9.8%).NasdaqGS:MYRG Past Revenue and Net Income, January 3rd 2020MoreThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. ROE can give us a view about company quality, but many investors also look to other factors, such as whether there are insiders buying shares. If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.MYR Group's Debt And Its 9.8% ROEWhile MYR Group does have some debt, with debt to equity of just 0.51, we wouldn't say debt is excessive. The combination of modest debt and a very respectable ROE suggests this is a business worth watching. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company's ability to take advantage of future opportunities.But It's Just One MetricReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Story continuesOf course MYR Group may not be the best stock to buy.
