The surge, which appeared to follow gains in oil and gold prices, pushed bitcoin into positive territory for the year-to-date, now up 2.2 percent.Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency-focused research firm Quantum Economics, noted in an email that the U.S. attack drove up prices for gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset whose value is expected to hold in times of geopolitical or economic instability. Many investors speculate that bitcoin bears similarities to gold, in terms of its perceived resistance to inflation. Related: American Cancer Society Now Accepting Bitcoin Donations Through BitPayHigher oil prices could make investors nervous about future economic growth while also potentially pushing up consumers’ costs at the gas pump, stoking faster inflation. Another consideration is whether the escalating tension might spur demand for bitcoin among Iranians, who have shown an appetite for cryptocurrencies in recent years as the Middle Eastern economy faced a host of sanctions ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.In late December, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech in Malaysia that Muslims might need their own cryptocurrency to “save themselves from the domination of the U.S. dollar and the American financial regime.”    Iran has “long been seen as one of the hotbeds for bitcoin adoption” due to U.S. sanctions on money transfers stemming from the country, not to mention a “very unstable economy,” according to Greenspan. Related: Hanukkah Reflections on My Year of Toying With BitcoinBut the news likely precipitated purchase orders from some investors who were already planning to buy bitcoin, Greenspan wrote. “The Iranian market in and of itself is likely too small and slow to have caused this move single-handedly,” according to Greenspan. “More likely, one or several players have been waiting on the side for a good buying opportunity below $7,000 per coin, and it seems one has presented itself.”Bitcoin prices surged 94 percent in 2019, making it one of the world’s best-performing assets, with roughly triple the total return charted by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks. Related Stories‘Multi-Part’ Payments Could Bring Bigger Bitcoin Sums to Lightning NetworkBitcoin Price Set to Outshine Gold and Stocks by Big Margin in 2019ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCryptocurrency News: SEC Shuts Down Another Bitcoin ETFInvestopediaCoronavirus Hits US Stocks, Bitcoin Climbs, Haven Status UnclearCoindeskShould You Have a Lung Cancer Screening?Consumer ReportsEther Futures Volume on FTX Hit Record HighsCoindeskSteven Seagal settles with SEC over undisclosed bitcoin promotionsEngadgetRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
