This represents a year-over-year change of 10.03% and 7.29%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWest Pharmaceutical may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.West Pharmaceutical has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 43.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 35.6X versus its peer group's average of 12.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.14. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, West Pharmaceutical currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if West Pharmaceutical passes the test. Thus, it seems as though West Pharmaceutical shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
