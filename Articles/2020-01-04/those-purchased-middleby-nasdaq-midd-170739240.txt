But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. We regret to report that long term The Middleby Corporation (NASDAQ:MIDD) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 16% in three years, versus a market return of about 50%. There was little comfort for shareholders in the last week as the price declined a further 1.6%. See our latest analysis for Middleby There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Although the share price is down over three years, Middleby actually managed to grow EPS by 11% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's worth taking a look at other metrics, because the EPS growth doesn't seem to match with the falling share price.We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 10% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching Middleby more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:MIDD Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year.
