Looking back a bit further, we're also happy to report the stock is up 76% in the last year.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. View our latest analysis for SPT Energy Group How Does SPT Energy Group's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?SPT Energy Group's P/E is 9.52. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (9.5) for companies in the energy services industry is roughly the same as SPT Energy Group's P/E.SEHK:1251 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreThat indicates that the market expects SPT Energy Group will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. I would further inform my view by checking insider buying and selling., among other things.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.SPT Energy Group's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 95% last year. Regrettably, the longer term performance is poor, with EPS down 17% per year over 5 years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does SPT Energy Group's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?SPT Energy Group's net debt is 0.6% of its market cap. It would probably trade on a higher P/E ratio if it had a lot of cash, but I doubt it is having a big impact.The Verdict On SPT Energy Group's P/E RatioSPT Energy Group's P/E is 9.5 which is below average (10.7) in the HK market. The EPS growth last year was strong, and debt levels are quite reasonable. The low P/E ratio suggests current market expectations are muted, implying these levels of growth will not continue. Because analysts are predicting more growth in the future, one might have expected to see a higher P/E ratio. You can take a closer look at the fundamentals, here. What we know for sure is that investors are becoming less uncomfortable about SPT Energy Group's prospects, since they have pushed its P/E ratio from 7.0 to 9.5 over the last month. For those who like to invest in turnarounds, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But others might consider the opportunity to have passed.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
