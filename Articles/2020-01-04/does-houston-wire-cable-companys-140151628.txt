This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. View our latest analysis for Houston Wire & Cable How Does Jim Pokluda's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?Our data indicates that Houston Wire & Cable Company is worth US$70m, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$1.4m for the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$515k. We further remind readers that the CEO may face performance requirements to receive the non-salary part of the total compensation. We examined a group of similar sized companies, with market capitalizations of below US$200m. The median CEO total compensation in that group is US$522k.It would therefore appear that Houston Wire & Cable Company pays Jim Pokluda more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into the underlying business performance.The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at Houston Wire & Cable has changed from year to year.NasdaqGS:HWCC CEO Compensation, January 3rd 2020MoreIs Houston Wire & Cable Company Growing?Over the last three years Houston Wire & Cable Company has grown its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 102% per year (using a line of best fit).
