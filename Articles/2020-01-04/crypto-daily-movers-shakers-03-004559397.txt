Bitcoin last closed out the day at sub-$7,000 on 17th December.The near-term bearish trend, formed at late June’s swing hi $13,764.0, remained firmly intact, reaffirmed with Bitcoin’s slide back to sub-$7,000 levels.For the bulls, Bitcoin would need to break out from $11,000 levels to form a near-term bullish trend.The Rest of the PackAcross the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a bearish day for the majors.Tezos led the way down, sliding by 9.32% to fall out of the top 10, by market cap.EOS (-5.37%), Litecoin (-5.23%), Binance Coin (-5.05%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-4.36%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (-4.18%) also saw heavy losses.Ethereum (-2.56%), Ripple’s XRP (-2.57%), Stellar’s Lumen (-3.61%), and Tron’s TRX (-2.39%) saw relatively modest losses.Through the current week, the crypto total market cap hit a Monday high $198.27bn before sliding to a Thursday low $185.26bn.

A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning high $6,992.8 to a low $6,977.0.Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the crypto majors.Binance Coin and Ethereum bucked the trend early on, rising by 0.49% and by 0.08% respectively.It was bearish for the rest, however, with Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin leading the way down. Both were down by 0.38% early on.For the Bitcoin Day AheadBitcoin would need to move back through to $7,060 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $7,155.80.Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break back through to $7,000 levels.Barring a broad-based crypto rally on the day, the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside.Failure to move through to $7,060 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red.A fall through Thursday’s low $6,963 would bring the first major support level at $6,893.0 into play before any recovery.Barring an extended sell-off, however, Bitcoin should continue to steer clear of the second major support level at $6,796.6.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
