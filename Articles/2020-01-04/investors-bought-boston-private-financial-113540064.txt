But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:BPFH) shareholders, since the share price is down 26% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 50%. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Private Financial Holdings There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Although the share price is down over three years, Boston Private Financial Holdings actually managed to grow EPS by 16% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The company has kept revenue pretty healthy over the last three years, so we doubt that explains the falling share price. There doesn't seem to be any clear correlation between the fundamental business metrics and the share price. That could mean that the stock was previously overrated, or it could spell opportunity now.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:BPFH Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Boston Private Financial Holdings will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Boston Private Financial Holdings, it has a TSR of -18% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveBoston Private Financial Holdings provided a TSR of 16% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 2.3% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy.
