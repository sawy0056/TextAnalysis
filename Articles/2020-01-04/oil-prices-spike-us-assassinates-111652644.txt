Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for three days of national mourning and warned of retaliation. “A forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands,” he said in a statement.The Pentagon said president Donald Trump ordered the attack in response to intelligence indicating that Soleimani was planning an attack on US diplomats in the Middle East.Gold touched a four-month high, government bonds rallied, and global stocks fell on news of the drone strike.
