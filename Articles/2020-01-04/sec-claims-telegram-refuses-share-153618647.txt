“Defendants are now refusing to disclose the bank records concerning how they have spent the $1.7 billion they raised from investors in the past two years and to answer questions about the disposition of investor funds.” The SEC argued that Telegram had already avoided revealing financial information to investors by selling an unlicensed security through its token sale, which sidestepped the requirement for a statutory prospectus. Discussing how Telegram broke securities laws, the SEC letter reads:
“Evidence shows that Telegram made continuous offers and sales of the Purchase Agreements well after the offering for which it claimed a Regulation D exemption.” As a result, the SEC is now asking the Southern District of New York Court to pass an order compelling Telegram to fully disclose sources, amounts, dates, and use of funds raised during the sale. The emergency order seeks expedited discovery of Telegram’s financial history, including a complete list of all the entities who purchased GRAM tokens, and up-to-date accounts from Telegram’s token sale and expenditure. Telegram’s ResponseThe SEC’s letter seems to imply that Telegram was claiming not to have access to its own bank accounts and records as it had ‘switched banks’.The claim, which the SEC described as “unfounded and deeply troubling”, may be seen as Telegram intentionally stalling the case or hiding crucial information, ahead of Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s deposition to the Court on January 7. Therefore, the SEC has urged the Southern District of New York Court to act before Durov appears in court. In November, Telegram representatives accused the SEC of being ‘unconstitutionally vague’, claiming that the regulator had failed to provide adequate guidance during and after the GRAM token sale. The post SEC claims Telegram refuses to share ICO financial details appeared first on Coin Rivet.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCrown Castle to revise financial statements after SEC probeAmerican City Business JournalsSEC orders Wells Fargo pay $35 million for recommendations of high-risk productsReutersDoorDash quietly files paperwork to go publicMarketWatchSteven Seagal to Pay SEC $314,000 for Failing to Disclose Payments Earned for Promotional WorkPeopleRegions Bank to acquire Texas-based equipment finance lenderAmerican City Business JournalsRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
