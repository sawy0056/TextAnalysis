For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether FlexQube (STO:FLEXQ) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. See our latest analysis for FlexQube When Might FlexQube Run Out Of Money?A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. FlexQube has such a small amount of debt that we'll set it aside, and focus on the kr36m in cash it held at September 2019. In the last year, its cash burn was kr31m. That means it had a cash runway of around 14 months as of September 2019. That's not too bad, but it's fair to say the end of the cash runway is in sight, unless cash burn reduces drastically. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.OM:FLEXQ Historical Debt, January 3rd 2020MoreHow Well Is FlexQube Growing?At first glance it's a bit worrying to see that FlexQube actually boosted its cash burn by 26%, year on year. The revenue growth of 14% gives a ray of hope, at the very least. Considering both these factors, we're not particularly excited by its growth profile. Of course, we've only taken a quick look at the stock's growth metrics, here. You can take a look at how FlexQube has developed its business over time by checking
this visualization of its revenue and earnings history.Can FlexQube Raise More Cash Easily?While FlexQube seems to be in a fairly good position, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).FlexQube's cash burn of kr31m is about 10% of its kr294m market capitalisation. Given that situation, it's fair to say the company wouldn't have much trouble raising more cash for growth, but shareholders would be somewhat diluted.Is FlexQube's Cash Burn A Worry?On this analysis of FlexQube's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its increasing cash burn has us a bit worried. While we're the kind of investors who are always a bit concerned about the risks involved with cash burning companies, the metrics we have discussed in this article leave us relatively comfortable about FlexQube's situation. When you don't have traditional metrics like earnings per share and free cash flow to value a company, many are extra motivated to consider qualitative factors such as whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
