(NYSE:M) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 11% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been disappointing. In fact, the share price has declined rather badly, down some 75% in that time. So we're not so sure if the recent bounce should be celebrated. We'd err towards caution given the long term under-performance. Check out our latest analysis for Macy's In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Looking back five years, both Macy's's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 6.1% per year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 24% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market was previously too optimistic about the stock. The low P/E ratio of 5.30 further reflects this reticence.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NYSE:M Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Macy's's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Macy's the TSR over the last 5 years was -68%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveMacy's shareholders are down 39% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 34%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 20% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
