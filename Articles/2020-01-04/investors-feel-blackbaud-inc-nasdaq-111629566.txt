While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$716k. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. As part of our analysis we looked at companies in the same jurisdiction, with market capitalizations of US$2.0b to US$6.4b. The median total CEO compensation was US$5.1m.It would therefore appear that Blackbaud, Inc. pays Mike Gianoni more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market.
