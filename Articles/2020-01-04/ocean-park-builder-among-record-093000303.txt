The other 12 firms are appealing against delisting, according to a spokesman for HKEX.The number of delistings in 2019 is almost triple the 11 that left the exchange the previous year, when seven firms voluntarily cancelled their listings to go private and only four were forced to delist. There were five delistings in 2017, and six each in the three years before that, according to data from Refinitiv."We believe that the new delisting regime can effectively improve corporate governance of listed issuers," an exchange spokesman said.Previously, a listed companies could suspend the trading of its shares for many years without facing any action."The new regime has incentivised suspended companies to act promptly towards trading resumption," the spokesman said, adding that eight firms have successfully resumed trading since the new rule was introduced.Dynasty Fine Wines Group resumed trading just a few days ahead of the July 31 deadline having been suspended for more than six years. Wireless solutions company Coolpad Group resumed trading on July 19 after its shares had been dormant for two years.View photosHKEX introduced its new delisting rule in August 2018.

The company said in a stock exchange filing on Friday last week that it had failed to resume trading before the July 31 deadline, and its appeal was later rejected. Its shares were delisted on Tuesday.China Candy Holdings, a mainland jelly confectionery maker that was listed on the second board, the GEM, was also delisted on New Year's Eve.The rise in delistings may continue this year, with 54 companies likely to be expelled if they fail to resume trading before their deadlines. Ten firms face a deadline at the end of this month, including Convoy Global Holdings that was embroiled in the largest financial scandal of the last decade. Convoy said in a stock exchange filing that it has been actively seeking to resume trading of its shares.Kelvin Wong Tin-yau, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, said the new delisting rule can encourage auditors and listed companies to seek ways to resolve their accounting problems at an earlier stage.Story continuesConvoy scandal continues as firm seeks damages from Ernst & Young"The threat of a delisting would force the companies to improve their disclosure and to seek ways to make an agreement with their auditors," Wong said.The delisting rule would also encourage investors to avoid poor quality companies, said Kenneth Leung Kai-cheong, a lawmaker for the accountancy sector."With the new delisting rules, investors know they may suffer a loss if the companies are delisted. The new rule will thus encourage investors to pay more attention to the corporate governance and management of the company," Leung said.Former broker and lawmaker Chim Pui-chung, 72, nicknamed the golden banker after helping troubled companies to resume trading in the 1980s and 1990s, disagreed."Small investors will lose everything when a company is delisted. The exchange should allow more time for the suspended companies to find new investors to restructure their business to resume trading in a bid to offer better protection to the small investors," Chim said.Hong Kong's market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, supported the HKEX delisting regime."The rules are designed to introduce a robust framework to facilitate timely delisting of companies no longer meeting the continuing listing criteria and provide certainty to the market on the delisting process, to maintain the quality and reputation of Hong Kong's securities market. The process is fair and transparent," a spokesman for the SFC said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
