We'll look at Ebix, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:EBIX) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Based on the last twelve months, Ebix's P/E ratio is 12.27. That means that at current prices, buyers pay $12.27 for every $1 in trailing yearly profits. Check out our latest analysis for Ebix How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Ebix:P/E of 12.27 = $33.44 ÷ $2.73 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Ebix's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Ebix has a lower P/E than the average (45.7) in the software industry classification.NasdaqGS:EBIX Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Ebix shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Since the market seems unimpressed with Ebix, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.Ebix's earnings per share fell by 23% in the last twelve months. But it has grown its earnings per share by 11% per year over the last five years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Ebix's Balance SheetEbix has net debt worth 61% of its market capitalization. This is a reasonably significant level of debt -- all else being equal you'd expect a much lower P/E than if it had net cash.The Bottom Line On Ebix's P/E RatioEbix trades on a P/E ratio of 12.3, which is below the US market average of 18.9. The P/E reflects market pessimism that probably arises from the lack of recent EPS growth, paired with significant leverage.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
