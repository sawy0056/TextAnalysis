Michael Zalewski” (emphasis added).  Additionally, “[t]he information sought by the FBI included records of communications among Madigan, McClain and Zalewski about attempts to obtain ComEd lobbying work for Zalewski.”On this news, Exelon’s stock price fell an additional $0.15 per share to close at $45.34 per share on November 1, 2019—a total decline of 2.83% since the initial announcement of the SEC investigation.The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
