But the long term shareholders of GomSpace Group AB (publ) (STO:GOMX) have had an unfortunate run in the last three years. Sadly for them, the share price is down 65% in that time. Check out our latest analysis for GomSpace Group Because GomSpace Group made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.In the last three years, GomSpace Group saw its revenue grow by 36% per year, compound. That is faster than most pre-profit companies. In contrast, the share price is down 29% compound, over three years - disappointing by most standards. This could mean hype has come out of the stock because the losses are concerning investors. But a share price drop of that magnitude could well signal that the market is overly negative on the stock.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).OM:GOMX Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreBalance sheet strength is crucial. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered GomSpace Group's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. GomSpace Group hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of -51% exceeds its share price return of -65%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.A Different PerspectiveGomSpace Group shareholders are up 20% for the year. It's always nice to make money but this return falls short of the market return which was about 38% for the year. The silver lining is that the recent rise is far preferable to the annual loss of 21% that shareholders have suffered over the last three years. We hope the turnaround in fortunes continues.
