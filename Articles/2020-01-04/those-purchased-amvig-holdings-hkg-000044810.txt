But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term AMVIG Holdings Limited (HKG:2300) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 40% over a half decade. It's up 2.0% in the last seven days. Check out our latest analysis for AMVIG Holdings While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the five years over which the share price declined, AMVIG Holdings's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 5.2% each year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 9.8% per year, over the period. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past. The low P/E ratio of 6.40 further reflects this reticence.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).SEHK:2300 Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreDive deeper into AMVIG Holdings's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of AMVIG Holdings's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for AMVIG Holdings the TSR over the last 5 years was -6.6%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that AMVIG Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 1.3% per year over the last half decade. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at AMVIG Holdings's dividend track record.
