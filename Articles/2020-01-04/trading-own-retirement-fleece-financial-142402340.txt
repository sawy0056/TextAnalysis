You're an accomplished investor. You've done truly well selecting stocks. You probably already own a couple of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like:Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), First Financial Corp. (THFF) and Sandy Spring Bancorp (SASR).If that sounds like you, should you actively trade your own retirement assets?Maybe ...if you're an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility. Be that as it may, for most investors, there might be better ways to accomplish long-term retirement investing objectives.That's because the risk - reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long-term wealth building and active stock trading.Managing Retirement Investments: Stock Picking vs. DiversificationPicking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns - but also carries a lot of risk, which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement.In fact, a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4% of equities produced all of the stock market's gains over the last 90 years. All other stocks "broke even" with the increases of 38% canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58%.Those numbers reinforce that, even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker, your chances of success over a long period are very slim.Is Investing Success All In Your Mind?Investors think they can make rational decisions, but research shows that the opposite is often true. A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S&P 500. Over 30 years, the S&P 500 returned 10.35%, but the average investor return was just 3.66%.It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008, and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well.An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets ...and irrational, emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes.Interestingly, even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can't help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions. They may be overconfident and misjudge risk, latch onto a price target, or perceive a pattern that isn't there. This "behavior gap", over the long-term, can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement.What It All Means for Retirement InvestorsYour retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades - not days, weeks or quarters. Most self-directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long-term results.Does that mean you should give up trading? Not necessarily. One solution is to take 10% of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns.However, the major part of your wealth - those assets reserved for retirement - ought to be invested utilizing a more careful, conservative, risk management strategy to produce steady, compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives.Do You Know the Top 9 Retirement Investing Mistakes?Whether you're planning to retire early or not, don't let investing mistakes derail your plans.If you have $500,000 or more to invest and want to learn more, click the link to download our free report, 9 Retirement Mistakes that will Ruin Your Retirement.This report will help you steer clear of the most common mistakes, like trying to time the market, lack of diversification in your portfolio, and many more.
