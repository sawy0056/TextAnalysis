Consumption of amino acid feed premixes has been on the rise, globally; Asia-Pacific and Latin America being high-growth markets. Markets such as China and India also benefit from the increasing domestic production of amino acids, especially lysine, as they are available at lower costs.The poultry segment to witness the fastest growth during the forecast period.By livestock, the feed premix industry is segmented into poultry, ruminants, swine, aquatic animals, equine and pets. The per capita consumption of poultry meat is significantly higher than that of beef and pork, owing to the easier breeding of poultry birds and rising prices of red meat as compared to poultry. Feed premix promotes fiber digestion, which helps in the growth of ruminants during various growth stages.Asia Pacific is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast periodAsia Pacific is the fastest-growing region in the feed premix market owing to the presence of some of the primary compound feed, feed additives, and feed premix producers in the world such as China and India. Most of the South East Asian countries are also focused on the production of feed premixes due to the growing livestock population.
