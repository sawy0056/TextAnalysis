The year-end rally was further buoyed by the proposed tariff cuts by the communist nation to boost its economy. With U.S. firms likely to gain greater market access in China per the partial trade accord, 2020 appears to be quite promising for the beleaguered industry.  Although President Trump tweeted the official date for the formal signing of the “Phase One” deal, China has maintained silence on the same. Keeping the cards close to the chest, Beijing is yet to publicly commit to key planks and unveil the specifics of the partial agreement, stating only that details will be released after the signing. Nonetheless, both the countries remain intent to seal the trade truce as early as possible on domestic compulsions and to fuel economic growth.Meanwhile, China has increased its import basket of U.S. agricultural products like soybeans, following a pledge to purchase $200 billion of goods over the next two years, including $40-$50 billion of agricultural products each year. In addition, China has lowered tariffs on more than 850 goods, ranging from frozen pork to semiconductors from Jan 1, in order to improve its flagging economy.Notably, the Trump administration had earlier called off a 15% tariff on nearly $160 billion worth of imports from China, including toys, smartphones, laptops and other electronics items. The U.S. government will also halve its 15% levy on $120 billion worth of Chinese import basket, leaving the tariff regime limited to 25% taxes on $250 billion and 7.5% on $120 billion, per the “Phase One” deal.Regarding company-specific news, 5G deployment, strategic deal, divesture and network upgrade took the center stage over the past five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.      Verizon Communications Inc.

CBB recently informed customers that that it is on the verge of losing FOX cable channels in 2020 due to an ongoing contract conflict between the cable company and Fox Corporation. The failure to ink a new contract, which expires on Dec 31, is likely to give a massive blow to the local cable provider as it may witness a substantial churn rate if the channel rate negotiation ultimately falls flat.Per media reports, the rates charged by Fox have surged more than 200% since 2009. The New York-based media company is currently seeking to hike prices by a hefty 20%, which reflects 10X the existing rate of inflation. The regional provider of data and voice communications services voiced concerns that there are more than 700 mid-sized and small cable operators that are negotiating with Fox on channel rates.
