Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Loomis:0.13 = kr2.4b ÷ (kr24b - kr5.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Loomis has an ROCE of 13%.

What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Loomis.Loomis's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCELiabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Loomis has total assets of kr24b and current liabilities of kr5.1b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 21% of its total assets. Low current liabilities are not boosting the ROCE too much.What We Can Learn From Loomis's ROCEThis is good to see, and with a sound ROCE, Loomis could be worth a closer look.
