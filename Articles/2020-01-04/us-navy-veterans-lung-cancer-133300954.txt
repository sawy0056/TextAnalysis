About 2500 US citizens each year are diagnosed with mesothelioma, and the Advocate estimates that four or five times as many people are diagnosed with lung cancer that is caused by asbestos exposure. Tragically most people with asbestos exposure lung cancer never get compensated.People who had heavy exposure to asbestos in the Navy or at work are five times more likely to get lung cancer than people who were not exposed to asbestos. Most people with asbestos exposure lung cancer do not realize the $30 billion dollar-asbestos trust funds were set up for them too as the Advocate would like to discuss anytime at 800-714-0303. The Advocate's initiative is nationwide for Navy Veterans or people with asbestos exposure in any state. https://USNavyLungCancer.ComThe US Navy Veterans Lung Cancer Advocate says, "We have endorsed the law firm of Karst von Oiste to assist a Navy Veteran or person with asbestos exposure lung cancer in any state.

With lung cancer caused by asbestos exposure the lung cancer may not show up until decades after the exposure. https://USNavyLungCancer.ComAccording to the American Cancer Society for nonsmokers who have been exposed to asbestos in their workplace the risk of lung cancer is five times that of unexposed workers. https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/statistics/index.htm.States with the highest incidence of lung cancer include Kentucky, West Virginia, Maine, Tennessee, Mississippi, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Alabama, and Delaware. However, a person with mesothelioma or asbestos exposure lung cancer could live in any state including New York, Florida, California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa, Georgia, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, Washington, Oregon or Alaska. www.karstvonoiste.com/For more information about asbestos exposure please visit the NIH's website on this topic: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/asbestos/asbestos-fact-sheet.Contact:Michael Thomas800-714-0303230123@email4pr.comCisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-navy-veterans-lung-cancer-advocate-now-appeals-to-a-navy-veteran-who-had-heavy-asbestos-exposure-and-now-has-lung-cancer-to-call-for-direct-access-to-the-lawyers-at-karst-von-oiste-to-help-with-compensation-300980470.htmlSOURCE US Navy Veterans Lung Cancer AdvocateReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextUS says Chinese ship fired laser at American aircraftAssociated PressShould You Have a Lung Cancer Screening?Consumer Reports$90 Million Upgrade: Is the Navy's Troubled Zumwalt Class Worth Fixing?The National InterestIs Iran Giving the Houthis Plane-Killer Missiles?The National InterestThis Is Where The U.S. Navy's Battleships Finally Got Their Revenge For Pearl HarborThe National InterestRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
