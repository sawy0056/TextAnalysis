Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for PunaMusta Media Oyj. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying PunaMusta Media Oyj for its dividend - read on to learn more. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on PunaMusta Media Oyj! HLSE:PUMU Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. PunaMusta Media Oyj paid out 116% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. PunaMusta Media Oyj paid out 100% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given PunaMusta Media Oyj's payments were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we are concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note PunaMusta Media Oyj's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.We update our data on PunaMusta Media Oyj every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of PunaMusta Media Oyj's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €0.20 in 2010, compared to €0.25 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 2.3% per year over this time. PunaMusta Media Oyj's dividend payments have fluctuated, so it hasn't grown 2.3% every year, but the CAGR is a useful rule of thumb for approximating the historical growth.It's good to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth, anyway. We're not that enthused by this.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. It's not great to see that PunaMusta Media Oyj's have fallen at approximately 2.6% over the past five years. If earnings continue to decline, the dividend may come under pressure. Every investor should make an assessment of whether the company is taking steps to stabilise the situation.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. It's a concern to see that the company paid out such a high percentage of its earnings and cashflow as dividends. Earnings per share have been falling, and the company has cut its dividend at least once in the past. From a dividend perspective, this is a cause for concern. Using these criteria, PunaMusta Media Oyj looks quite suboptimal from a dividend investment perspective.See if management have their own wealth at stake, by checking insider shareholdings in PunaMusta Media Oyj stock.Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
