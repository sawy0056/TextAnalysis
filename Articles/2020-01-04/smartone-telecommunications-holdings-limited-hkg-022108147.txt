All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings:0.11 = HK$819m ÷ (HK$9.9b - HK$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings has an ROCE of 11%.

The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings has total liabilities of HK$2.7b and total assets of HK$9.9b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 27% of its total assets.
