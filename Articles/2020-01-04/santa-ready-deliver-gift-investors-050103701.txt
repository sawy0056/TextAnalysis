Over that span, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index edged up 0.4%, according to FactSet.And that bodes well for stocks the rest of the year, analysts say. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East threatened to upend the rally. Stocks slumped Friday after a U.S. airstrike killed a top Iranian general, cutting into what had been a 1.1% gain for the S&P 500 heading into the final day of the Santa-rally period.20 stocks to buy in 2020: Apple, Amazon and Disney are among favorites of Wall Street prosRecord rally: Here’s why your 401(k) is celebrating 2019"This was a one-off event with Iran and it doesn't appear to be a major warning sign for markets yet," says Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. When stocks fall in that period, the decline tends to signal a bear market or a sizable decline is coming, according to The Stock Trader’s Almanac. Bear markets followed after the rally failed to materialize in 1999 and 2007.Still, the stock market may be due for a pause in January.  Stocks are showing signs of being inflated in price, analysts say. The 14-day relative strength index, a widely watched stock market barometer, climbed above 70 recently, a reading that tends to signal that stocks are vulnerable to a decline.“Given the recent rally, stocks could pull back in January,” says Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments.Another catalyst for stocks, analysts say, is fourth-quarter earnings season, which kicks off later this month. Corporate profits proved to be more resilient than expected in the third quarter, which helped ease fears about trade tensions and economic growth. The earnings outlook, however, hasn't improved much recently, according to Bank of America Global Research.To be sure, stocks are sitting pretty heading into 2020. Since 1945, when the S&P 500 index has risen at least 20% in a year, it gained an average 10% the following year and was higher nearly 80% of the time, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at financial-research company CFRA.“Long-term investors need to remember that it’s their time in the market that’s most important, not timing the market,” says Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at Vantagepoint Investment Advisers.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Stock market: Middle East tensions fail to upend Santa Claus rallyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTimeless Software (HKG:8028) Shareholders Have Enjoyed A 51% Share Price GainSimply Wall St.Here are 5 reasons the stock market is having its worst decline since 2008, and only one of them is the coronavirusMarketWatchHow bad is the coronavirus-sparked stock-market selloff? — the Dow’s weekly skid would rank within the top 15 worst in its 124-year historyMarketWatchThis stock has scored the biggest boost from the coronavirus outbreak — but the company has been out of business for yearsMarketWatchChina Stock Option’s 2,800% Surge Shows Rush for HedgesBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
