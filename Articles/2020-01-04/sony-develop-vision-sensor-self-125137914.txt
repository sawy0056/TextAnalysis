Mobility is next,” said Sony’s chief executive Kenichiro Yoshida in an interview. The move comes as other tech companies are already in the race to develop more functional vision sensors for self-driving vehicles.In December, a Silicon Valley start-up called Aeva developed a smaller and more capable version of the vision sensor for autonomous cars and received backing from Porsche Automobil Holding SE (OTC: POAHF), the majority owner of VOLKSWAGEN AG (OTC: VLKPY).  Why It MattersCurrent lidar vision sensor models tend to be bulky and fragile and often cost thousands of dollars. Sony has certain advantages over its competitors to grab the market leader position for vision sensors and offer the devices at an affordable price, analysts told Financial Times. The company has the technology and infrastructure to produce lidars and image sensors in large volumes and sell those as a package to self-driving carmakers, the analysts said.Photo Credit: mk7 via Wikimedia0See more from BenzingaChip Market Could Rebound In 2020: Nintendo And Apple Chip MakerSamsung Shipped 6.7M Smartphones With 5G In 2019, Exceeding Its Own ExpectationsU.S. Passes Legislation To Control The Sale Of Cyber Tools Abroad© 2020 Benzinga.com.
