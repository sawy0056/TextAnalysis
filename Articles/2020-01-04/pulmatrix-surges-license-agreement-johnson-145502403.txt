PULM announced that it has inked a licensing and development agreement with the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson JNJ. The agreement grants the Lung Cancer Initiative an option to gain rights to Pulmatrix’s portfolio of narrow spectrum kinase inhibitors, including an early-stage candidate PUR1800. These candidates are intended to be developed for lung cancer interception.Per the terms of the agreement, Pulmatrix will receive $7.2 million in upfront payment and is eligible to receive additional $2 million in milestone payments on completion of an early-stage clinical study on PUR1800. The study is expected to be completed by 2020-end.

The candidate is intended to be developed for treating acute exacerbations in patients with COPD and is currently being evaluated in a phase Ib study.Apart from PUR1800, the company has other pipeline candidates using iSPERSE technology in clinical development, which includes Pulmazole.
