Kasa works with local farmers and indigenous Amazonian communities to cultivate fruits for the Mambe beverages which provides sustainable economic opportunities to these communities and is a viable alternative to Amazon deforestation and illegal mining in these areas.Damian Lopez, Flora’s CEO, commented: “We are excited to acquire an entrepreneurial, innovative company like Kasa Wholefoods.  They have done an excellent job of developing a line of world-class juices and chocolates.  There is immense demand for CBD-infused products in Latin America and worldwide. We will combine our organic CBD-Oil with Kasa’s organic Amazonian based fruit juices and chocolates to satisfy this demand. We expect to obtain regulatory approval in Colombia to infuse food & beverages with CBD in 2020 and be the market leader in this category.”In order to close the Transaction, Flora must pay to shareholders of Kasa (the “Vendors”) an aggregate amount of USD$294,000 in cash and shall repay Kasa’s outstanding loan payables of USD$91,000.   The Vendors shall retain a 10% equity interest in Kasa which may not be diluted until Flora invests USD$5 million in Kasa.  Following the completion of this financing milestone, all shareholders of Kasa will be diluted if they do not participate in any Kasa financing.The Transaction is subject to the parties negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement and obtaining of the necessary regulatory approvals.Flora Growth Corp.
