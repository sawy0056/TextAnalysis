The UK£39m market-cap posted a loss in its most recent financial year of -UK£1.4m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of -UK£1.9m leading to an even wider gap between loss and breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is ACC’s path to profitability – when will it breakeven? Below I will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for ACC. Check out our latest analysis for Access Intelligence Expectation from Software analysts is ACC is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2020, before turning a profit of UK£2.3m in 2021. So, ACC is predicted to breakeven approximately a few months from now. What rate will ACC have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, I calculated an average annual growth rate of 93%, which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, ACC may become profitable much later than analysts predict.AIM:ACC Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreGiven this is a high-level overview, I won’t go into details of ACC’s upcoming projects, however, bear in mind that by and large a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.One thing I’d like to point out is that ACC has managed its capital judiciously, with debt making up 10% of equity. This means that ACC has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital,and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Next Steps:There are key fundamentals of ACC which are not covered in this article, but I must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.
