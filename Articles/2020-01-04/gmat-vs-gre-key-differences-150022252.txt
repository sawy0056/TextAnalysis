And MBA applicants can choose which test to take in order to showcase their academic potential.Among the 156 MBA programs surveyed by Kaplan Test Prep between August and November 2019, 93% reported that they allowed applicants to submit GRE scores as an alternative to GMAT scores.Asked whether they had a preference between the two exams, 88% of programs reported that one test was not advantaged over the other during their admissions process. The remaining 12% said that GMAT test-takers had a leg up.Bryan Moschel, director of admissions and operations with The Graduate School at Montclair State University in New Jersey, suggests that prospective students should inquire about how their target schools view standardized tests."Admissions review processes evolve from year to year, so it's important to stay current," he wrote in an email. "For example, Montclair State University accepts both the GRE and GMAT, and provides waivers for applicants who have demonstrated a high level of academic achievement at the undergraduate level."The Stanford Graduate School of Business is among the many business schools that give the GRE and the GMAT equal weight. "We have no preference for one test over the other," the school's website states.Dennis Yim, director of academics with Kaplan Test Prep, notes that because the vast majority of B-schools accept scores from both tests, finding out which test a school prefers is no longer as important as it was in the past.One of the original arguments for taking the GRE instead of the GMAT no longer applies, says Stacey Koprince, content and curriculum lead with Manhattan Prep, a tutoring company that is a subsidiary of Kaplan Test Prep."The landscape has changed enough that the original advantage of the GRE -- not as many people are taking it and the averages aren't reported, so you don't have to get such a crazy high score -- no longer exists," she wrote. "Now, schools do publish average (GRE) scores and they are creeping up to rival GMAT scores in terms of being seriously inflated."[Read:
How to Find a Good GRE Practice Test and Interpret Your Test Results.]Koprince notes that B-schools are increasingly open to accepting results from the Executive Assessment, a standardized test that assesses the skills of experienced business executives. It was designed by the Graduate Management Admission Council, the organization that administers the GMAT, so in some cases it is a viable alternative to the GMAT and GRE.Here are six factors experts say MBA applicants should consider when choosing between the GMAT and GRE:-- Math skills.-- Language skills.-- Career goals.-- Test anxiety.-- Test prep materials provided by the test-makers.-- Score reporting policies.Math skills. Experts say the quantitative questions on the GMAT are generally more difficult than those on the GRE."As a result, students with stronger math skills may want to take the GMAT in order to demonstrate those skills," Dan Edmonds, a test prep tutor with the New York-based admissions consulting firm IvyWise, wrote in an email. "Further, if you plan to apply to a program that values math skills, that program may look more favorably on the GMAT than the GRE."Although the quantitative section is harder on the GMAT than on the GRE for most test-takers, the GMAT may be easier for those who prefer logic problems over geometry questions because there are more geometry questions on the GRE, experts say."If you really dislike geometry, then you might lean towards the GMAT," Koprince says.[READ: Fit the GMAT Into Overall MBA Application Strategy.]Language skills. The GRE includes more obscure words on it than the GMAT does, experts say, and the GRE verbal section can be difficult for nonnative English speakers."The GRE verbal section is generally more difficult than the GMAT verbal section; that difficulty is in large part driven by the extent to which the GRE tests tough vocabulary," Edmonds says.Career goals. MBA applicants who plan on working for management consulting firms or investment banking firms after business school should know that some of these firms require job applicants to submit GMAT scores, so keep that in mind when picking a test, Koprince says.Story continuesShe says two Manhattan Prep clients who were accepted to B-school with the GRE ended up needing to take the GMAT during school so they could be considered for full-time consulting jobs.Test anxiety. Unlike the GMAT, the GRE allows test-takers to save and return to questions during each section, which can reduce the amount of stress involved in completing the test, says Erfun Geula, the owner-operator of two test prep companies, GRE Compass and GMAT Compass.Geula, who has authored GRE prep guides, says because the GRE allows test-takers to skip questions they find difficult and the GMAT does not, MBA applicants who have a tendency to panic when faced with hard standardized test questions often perform better on the GRE."You can skip back and forth on questions on the GRE, which some people just prefer for reducing anxiety," he says.Koprince says some GRE test-takers find comfort in being able to return to test questions to check their work if they have sufficient time, and that the lack of this opportunity to change answers on the GMAT can make the test more psychologically difficult."In practice, the time constraints are so tight on both exams that you don't really have time to come back anyway, but just knowing that you could makes a big difference for some people," Koprince wrote in an email. "It allows them to let go more easily, where, on the GMAT, they might get completely stuck and really mess up their timing, and therefore, their score."[Read:
What Is a Good GMAT Score?]The GMAT format may be ideal for students who like to get through a test in a speedy way, Moschel says."Some may prefer the structured format that prevents you from looking too far ahead," he wrote in an email. "However, the limitation from skipping questions or returning to previously answered ones may not be for everyone."Test prep materials provided by the test-makers. Geula notes that, unlike in the past, there are now five official GRE practice exams that people who are registered for the test can obtain from ETS, the organization that creates the test.Meanwhile, GMAC -- the organization responsible for creating and administering the GMAT -- offers six official GMAT practice exams."One of the biggest challenges for those prepping for the GRE is the relative lack of official materials, relative to what one can get from GMAC, so these additional practice tests somewhat level the playing field for GRE test-takers," Geula says.Score reporting policies. Moschel notes that one key distinction between the GRE and the GMAT is that repeat GRE test-takers can choose which of their GRE scores to report to schools. The GRE offers test-takers a ScoreSelect option that permits them to hand-pick the scores they submit.This feature of the GRE, Moschel says, "can be reassuring for a prospective student who may not test well."Searching for a business school?
