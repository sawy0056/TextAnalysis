A complete set of shaders for skin, eyes, teeth, and hair are available, along with SSS (Sub -Surface Scattering) and Micro Normal updates for iClone 7.7 and 3D character creation tool Character Creator 3.2 for fast, real-time rendering for images and live performances.With the latest iClone and Character Creator (CC) updates, designers can one-click convert PBR assets into digital human shaders. Artists utilizing professional assets such as Texturingxyz, and digital sculpting and texturing tools like ZBrush and Substance Painter can now see their characters animated directly in iClone.Official trailer video: https://youtu.be/ajse-n5Fs_MDigital Human Skin Shader SSS (Subsurface Scattering)In Character Creator 3.2 and iClone 7.7, users can produce realistic human skin utilizing realtime SSS features and adjusting SSS effects for character head and body skin, making them slightly translucent during less direct reflection.Micro NormaliClone and Character Creator apply Micro Normal technology for fine skin details when viewed up close, and less detail when viewed from further away.Digital Human Eye ShaderThe Eye Shader is designed to bring realistic real-time rendering of an eye model, exposing aesthetic control over each of the biological parts of the eye. Artists can achieve multiple human eye variations by using image masks and parametric sliders for pupil, iris, limbus, and sclera. SSS can be used to adjust moisture and light transmission effects through the eyeballs.Digital Human Teeth, Gums, Tongue ShaderIncluded are full controls over Brightness, Desaturation, Roughness, and Specular by overall setting or by specific area. Adjustable AO masking to conceal over-lit inner teeth and tongue are also available. Mirco Normals can be applied with adjusted strength and tiling, and SSS can be used to adjust light transmission effects.Digital Human Hair ShaderHair shader simulates the reflection of light from hair with anisotropic specularity, while also calculating the light refraction, and the light scatter between hair strands. Users can define the direction of the hair flow, set the base color strength, transmission value, specular strength, and secondary specular strength.Enhanced Lighting for Digital HumansWork in Spotlight and Point Light with the adjustable light shapes including Tube and Rectangle, or import custom patterns for the preferred shape. Not only do they improve the eye reflection for more natural human looks, but they also effectively soften the light and shadow to achieve more realistic scenes.Compatible with Industry Character Design PipelineThe Digital Human Shader benefits artists who wish to quickly animate realistic CG humans made from custom models. Several successful samples include converting Unreal's Mike Seymour 3D scan model to Character Creator by using Wrap3, importing 3D sculpted Javier Bardem by ZBrush prodige Hossein Diba, and animating 3D characters made from one photo using the Character Creator 3 Headshot plugin.Once your character is applied with proper light settings, the CC/iClone Digital Human Shader gives CG characters unprecedented skin details, realistic eye reflections, believable teeth, and healthier-looking hair, which can be realtime animated through iClone's iPhone facial mocap.Learn more about Character Creator 3.2: https://www.reallusion.com/character-creator/digital-human-shader.htmlLearn more about iClone 7.7 update: https://forum.reallusion.com/426901/ SOURCE Reallusion Inc.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
