Iran declared a traditional three-day mourning period after his death."We assess that the deaths of Soleimani and al Muhandis are likely to materialize in multiple scenarios ... Retaliatory measures could include the possible use of short-range ballistic missiles, cyber operations, bombings and targeted assassinations," Priscilla Moriuchi, director of Strategic Threat Development at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, told FOX Business."Although Iran possesses highly capable cyber operational forces, we believe the most likely targets of cyberattacks remain U.S. and partner interests regionally," she added.Moriuchi also brought up recent instances in which Russian operatives hacked into Iranian technology to conduct cyber operations, which she said "will also likely cause increased uncertainty and possibly confusion for victims. It is less clear today that operations utilizing known and tracked Iranian cyberinfrastructure are actually being run and directed by the Iranian government."DEMOCRATS CALL US KILLING OF IRANIAN GENERAL 'RECKLESS'Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told "FOX and Friends" on Friday that the threat of a cyberattack is "always" a possibility."There’s always risk of cyberattacks," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told "FOX and Friends" on Friday. "The Iranians have a deep and complex cyber capability, to be sure.
