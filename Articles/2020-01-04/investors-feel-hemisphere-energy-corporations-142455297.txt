This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally - as a second measure of performance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels. See our latest analysis for Hemisphere Energy How Does Don Simmons's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?At the time of writing, our data says that Hemisphere Energy Corporation has a market cap of CA$18m, and reported total annual CEO compensation of CA$312k for the year to December 2018. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at CA$204k. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations under CA$260m, and the median CEO total compensation was CA$225k.It would therefore appear that Hemisphere Energy Corporation pays Don Simmons more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into the underlying business performance.You can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at Hemisphere Energy, below.TSXV:HME CEO Compensation, January 3rd 2020MoreIs Hemisphere Energy Corporation Growing?Hemisphere Energy Corporation has increased its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 26% a year, over the last three years (using a line of best fit).
