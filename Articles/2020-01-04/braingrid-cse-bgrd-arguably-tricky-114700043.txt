For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed.So, the natural question for Braingrid (CSE:BGRD) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. See our latest analysis for Braingrid When Might Braingrid Run Out Of Money?A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. When Braingrid last reported its balance sheet in October 2019, it had zero debt and cash worth CA$167k. In the last year, its cash burn was CA$1.5m. Therefore, from October 2019 it seems to us it had less than two months of cash runway. It's extremely surprising to us that the company has allowed its cash runway to get that short! Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.CNSX:BGRD Historical Debt, January 3rd 2020MoreHow Is Braingrid's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Whilst it's great to see that Braingrid has already begun generating revenue from operations, last year it only produced CA$141k, so we don't think it is generating significant revenue, at this point. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on how the cash burn is tracking. Given the length of the cash runway, we'd interpret the 32% reduction in cash burn, in twelve months, as prudent if not necessary for capital preservation. Admittedly, we're a bit cautious of Braingrid due to its lack of significant operating revenues. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.How Hard Would It Be For Braingrid To Raise More Cash For Growth?Even though it has reduced its cash burn recently, shareholders should still consider how easy it would be for Braingrid to raise more cash in the future. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.Braingrid has a market capitalisation of CA$303k and burnt through CA$1.5m last year, which is 509% of the company's market value. Given just how high that expenditure is, relative to the company's market value, we think there's an elevated risk of funding distress, and we would be very nervous about holding the stock.Is Braingrid's Cash Burn A Worry?There are no prizes for guessing that we think Braingrid's cash burn is a bit of a worry. Take, for example, its cash runway, which suggests the company may have difficulty funding itself, in the future. While not as bad as its cash runway, its cash burn reduction is also a concern, and considering everything mentioned above, we're struggling to find much to be optimistic about. Looking at the metrics in this article all together, we consider its cash burn situation to be rather dangerous, and likely to cost shareholders one way or the other. For us, it's always important to consider risks around cash burn rates. But investors should look at a whole range of factors when researching a new stock. For example, it could be interesting to see how much the Braingrid CEO receives in total remuneration.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company with better fundamentals, then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt or this list of stocks which are all forecast to grow.If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
