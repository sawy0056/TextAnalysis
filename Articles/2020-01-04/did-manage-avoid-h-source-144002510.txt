But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So spare a thought for the long term shareholders of H-Source Holdings Ltd. (CVE:HSI); the share price is down a whopping 80% in the last three years. That'd be enough to cause even the strongest minds some disquiet.

View our latest analysis for H-Source Holdings H-Source Holdings recorded just US$826,539 in revenue over the last twelve months, which isn't really enough for us to consider it to have a proven product. We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. Investors will be hoping that H-Source Holdings can make progress and gain better traction for the business, before it runs low on cash.We think companies that have neither significant revenues nor profits are pretty high risk. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some companies like this go on to deliver on their plan, making good money for shareholders, many end in painful losses and eventual de-listing. Some H-Source Holdings investors have already had a taste of the bitterness stocks like this can leave in the mouth.H-Source Holdings had liabilities exceeding cash by US$2.9m when it last reported in September 2019, according to our data.

In contrast the market gained about 19%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Shareholders have lost 42% per year over the last three years, so the share price drop has become steeper, over the last year; a potential symptom of as yet unsolved challenges.
