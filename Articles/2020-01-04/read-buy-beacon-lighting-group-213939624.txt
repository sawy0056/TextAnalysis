We'll look at Beacon Lighting Group Limited's (ASX:BLX) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Based on the last twelve months, Beacon Lighting Group's P/E ratio is 16.15. That means that at current prices, buyers pay A$16.15 for every A$1 in trailing yearly profits. See our latest analysis for Beacon Lighting Group How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Beacon Lighting Group:P/E of 16.15 = A$1.19 ÷ A$0.07 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does Beacon Lighting Group Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company.

If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. Checking factors such as director buying and selling. could help you form your own view on if that will happen.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.Beacon Lighting Group saw earnings per share decrease by 19% last year. But EPS is up 6.1% over the last 5 years. And EPS is down 4.7% a year, over the last 3 years. This growth rate might warrant a low P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Beacon Lighting Group's Balance SheetNet debt totals 12% of Beacon Lighting Group's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Bottom Line On Beacon Lighting Group's P/E RatioBeacon Lighting Group's P/E is 16.1 which is below average (18.7) in the AU market. The debt levels are not a major concern, but the lack of EPS growth is likely weighing on sentiment.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
