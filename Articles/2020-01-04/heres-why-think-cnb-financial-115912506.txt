But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like CNB Financial (NASDAQ:CCNE), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. Check out our latest analysis for CNB Financial How Fast Is CNB Financial Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Impressively, CNB Financial has grown EPS by 20% per year, compound, in the last three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of CNB Financial's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. CNB Financial maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 16% to US$132m. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.In the last twelve months CNB Financial insiders spent US$7.2k on stock; good news for shareholders. While this isn't much, we also note an absence of sales.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for CNB Financial bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. To be specific, they have US$24m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 4.9% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Is CNB Financial Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that CNB Financial has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Not only that, but we can see that insiders both own a lot of, and are buying more, shares in the company. So I do think this is one stock worth watching. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if CNB Financial is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Story continuesThe good news is that CNB Financial is not the only growth stock with insider buying.
