Sathya Narayanan(Reuters) - Gold prices surged on Friday to a four-month peak, racing past the key $1,550 an ounce level after a U.S. air strike in Iraq killed the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, prompting a rush into safety assets.Spot gold rose 1.4% to $1,549.63 per ounce as of 10:29 a.m. ET (1529 GMT), having risen to $1,551.36 earlier in the session, its highest since Sept. 5.U.S. gold futures rose 1.6% to $1,552.30 per ounce.The overnight attack was a dramatic escalation in a "shadow war" in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and its allies, principally Israel and Saudi Arabia. Iran threatened to retaliate after the air strike."With the U.S. air strikes overnight in Iraq from orders of President Trump and Iran's leader vowed revenge as a result, the equity markets are down and safe-havens are higher, causing a move higher in the precious metals," said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures."The market has been trading well since we broke out above the $1,490 level, making new recent highs this morning up above $1,550."U.S. 10-year yields fell sharply, while the Japanese yen hit a two-month high against the U.S. dollar.Gold, like other safe-haven assets, benefits during times of political uncertainty.
