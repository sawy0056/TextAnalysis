This event will be archived on the Domino's website for replay.About Domino's Pizza®Founded in 1960, Domino's Pizza is the largest pizza company in the world based on retail sales, with a significant business in both delivery and carryout pizza. It ranks among the world's top public restaurant brands with a global enterprise of more than 16,500 stores in over 85 markets. Domino's had global retail sales of over $13.5 billion in 2018, with nearly $6.6 billion in the U.S. and more than $6.9 billion internationally. In the third quarter of 2019, Domino's had global retail sales of over $3.2 billion, with over $1.6 billion in the U.S. and over $1.6 billion internationally. Its system is comprised of independent franchise owners who accounted for 98% of Domino's stores as of the third quarter of 2019. Emphasis on technology innovation helped Domino's achieve more than half of all global retail sales in 2018 from digital channels. In the U.S., Domino's generates over 65% of sales via digital channels and has developed several innovative ordering platforms, including those developed for Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo and Twitter – as well as Domino's HotSpots®, an ordering platform featuring over 200,000 unique, non-traditional delivery locations. In late 2017, Domino's began an industry-first test of self-driving vehicle delivery, and in June 2019 announced a partnership with Nuro, furthering its exploration and testing of autonomous pizza delivery.Order – dominos.com   AnyWare Ordering – anyware.dominos.comCompany Info – biz.dominos.com  Twitter – twitter.com/dominos   Facebook – facebook.com/dominos   Instagram – instagram.com/dominos YouTube – youtube.com/dominosPlease visit our Investor Relations website at biz.dominos.com to view news, announcements, investor presentations, earnings releases and conference webcasts. CisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dominos-pizza-announces-icr-conference-presentation-webcast-300980979.htmlSOURCE Domino's Pizza, Inc.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWalmart+ is the retailer's latest attempt to take on Amazon PrimeEngadgetQurate Retail, Inc.
