Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Kape Technologies:0.053 = US$4.4m ÷ (US$101m - US$20m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, Kape Technologies has an ROCE of 5.3%.
See our latest analysis for Kape Technologies Is Kape Technologies's ROCE Good?One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Kape Technologies.Kape Technologies's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCECurrent liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Kape Technologies has total liabilities of US$20m and total assets of US$101m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 20% of its total assets. This very reasonable level of current liabilities would not boost the ROCE by much.Story continuesOur Take On Kape Technologies's ROCEWith that in mind, we're not overly impressed with Kape Technologies's ROCE, so it may not be the most appealing prospect.
