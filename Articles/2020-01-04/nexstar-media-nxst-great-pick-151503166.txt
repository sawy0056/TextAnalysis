After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Nexstar Media Group, Inc. NXST stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Nexstar Media has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.02, as you can see in the chart below:View photos This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.15. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Nexstar Media’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.View photos Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.27. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers. View photosStory continues We should also point out that Nexstar Media has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 20.24, which is tad higher than the current level. So, it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings. Right now, Nexstar Media has a P/S ratio of about 1.94. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.48 right now.  Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. View photos If anything, NXST is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms. Broad Value Outlook In aggregate, Nexstar Media currently has a Zacks Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Nexstar Media a solid choice for value investors.   What About the Stock Overall?   Though Nexstar Media might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D. This gives NXST a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>) Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower while the current year estimate has seen one upward revision compared to three downward in the same time period.     This has had a notable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 31.9% in the past two months, while the current year estimate has improved by 7.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Nexstar Media Group, Inc Price and Consensus View photosNexstar Media Group, Inc Price and ConsensusMoreNexstar Media Group, Inc price-consensus-chart | Nexstar Media Group, Inc QuoteDespite the mixed analyst sentiments, the stock holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom Line  Nexstar Media is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front. A strong industry rank (among top 37% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #2 further instils our confidence. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has clearly outperformed the market at large, as you can see below:View photos So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity.
