In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for NTS:0.075 = kr395m ÷ (kr6.2b - kr931m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, NTS has an ROCE of 7.5%. Check out our latest analysis for NTS Does NTS Have A Good ROCE?When making comparisons between similar businesses, investors may find ROCE useful.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure.

Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.NTS has total liabilities of kr931m and total assets of kr6.2b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 15% of its total assets. This is a modest level of current liabilities, which would only have a small effect on ROCE.The Bottom Line On NTS's ROCEIf NTS continues to earn an uninspiring ROCE, there may be better places to invest.
