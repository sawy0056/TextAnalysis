It dubbed the day in honor of the diet to promote itself as a place to purchase items related to the diet, according to Vitamin Shoppe. National Keto Day takes place on Jan. 5  and is supposed to "to educate and bring awareness to the ketogenic diet and further highlight the many health benefits a keto lifestyle offers," according to National Day Calendar, which tracks more than 1,500 promotional holidays.The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that typically involves replacing carbohydrates with fat, causing what is called ketosis in the body due to the reduction in carbs. Proponents of the Keto diet say that being in a state of ketosis makes the body more efficient at burning fat for energy, and then turns fat into ketones in the liver, which in turn can supply energy for the brain, according to Healthline.Keto diets have also been found to cause massive reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels, with various other health benefits attributed to the low-carb regimen.The fast-food chains, owned by parent company CKE Restaurants, are no stranger to introducing new and interesting food items on their menu. Back in October, Hardee's & Carl's Jr. tested out meatless, plant-based options by including Beyond Meat substitutes for breakfast, lunch and dinner entrees.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSRelated ArticlesBlue Buffalo dog food made my dog obese, diabetic: LawsuitThese states have the most, least electric car charging stations: ReportLori Loughlin hires prison coach to learn martial arts: 'Worst advice' thus far, expert saysReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next20 Keto Steak Recipes to Try for Dinner TonightPureWowRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
