U.S. District Judge David Hittner said Friday that Quanta hadn’t shown any reason why the jury’s findings should be set aside. He tripled the damages award, as authorized under antitrust law, to $528 million before deducting the $89 million in settlements paid by the other companies HP accused of participating in the price-fixing scheme.Other disk-drive makers like Hitachi-LG, Sony and Panasonic settled with HP over the past decade. Only Taiwan-based Quanta chose to go to trial.Andrew Lusby, an attorney for Quanta, said Friday the company was not commenting at this time on the tripled damages.The company had argued to Hittner that tripling damages would violate constitutional prohibitions on excessive punitive damages. But the judge rejected that argument, pointing out that antitrust law allows for tripling awards as compensatory rather than punitive damages.“HP hopes this judgment sends a powerful message to suppliers all over the world that there are significant consequences when you violate US antitrust laws,” Alex B. Roberts, HP’s lawyer, said in an email after Hittner ruled.The case is Hewlett-Packard Co. v Quanta Storage, 4:18-762, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston).To contact the reporter on this story: Laurel Calkins in New York at laurel@calkins.us.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Anthony LinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThat Quick Post-Volmageddon VIX Drop May Not Happen This TimeBloombergInvestors in Asia Still Betting Markets Will End Higher in 2020BloombergLimited Virus Testing in Japan Masks True Scale of InfectionBloombergOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
