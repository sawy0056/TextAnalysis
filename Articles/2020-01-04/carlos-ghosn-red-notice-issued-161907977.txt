The former Renault CEO and Nissan chairman was out on bail in Japan – and was supposedly being watched closely – when he fled the country early Monday.FLIGHT RECORDS OF GHOSN ESCAPE FALSIFIED TO HIDE AUTO EXEC'S TRAVEL, JET FIRM SAYSA Lebanese state security official later told state NNA news Ghosn will not face legal repercussions, Reuters reported at the time. Sources close to the ousted auto exec told The New York Times he met with Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun soon after his escape, which the executive office has denied.Investigators probing the getaway took seven people into custody on Thursday, though it wasn’t immediately clear if charges were filed. Meanwhile, prosecutors in Japan, which does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon, announced the procurement of Ghosn’s Red Notice that same day.CARLOS GHOSN ON JAPAN ESCAPE: 'MY FAMILY HAD NO ROLE'But Ghosn is not the first prominent figure for which a Red Notice was issued. Here’s a look at some high-powered, or well-known people for whom Red Notices have been issued or, at the very least, sought:NBA PLAYER ENES KANTERTurkish prosecutors sought a Red Notice for the now-Boston Celtics center in January 2019, accusing him of having ties to a terror organization.Law enforcement in Turkey cited Kanter’s alleged links to exiled Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is blamed for a failed coup in 2016, and accusing him of providing financial support to Gulen's group, according to Turkish Sabah newspaper.The threat prevented Kanter from traveling to London for a game while he was with the New York Knicks in January, according to The Associated Press, and a game against the Toronto Raptors soon after he was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, NBC Sports Northwest reported.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS“My decision not to travel to London was difficult from a competitive standpoint but much easier from a safety one,” he wrote in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. “It helps puts a spotlight on how a dictator is wrecking Turkey — people have been killed, thousands are unjustly imprisoned, and countless lives have been ruined. That is no game.”FORMER BAHRAINIAN NATIONAL SOCCER PLAYER HAKEEM AL-ARAIBIAl-Araibi fled Bahrain, citing political repression as the reason for doing so. At the time, he faced a 10-year prison sentence for an arson attack that damaged a police station. He denied those charges and said the case was politically motivated.He said he had previously been blindfolded and had his legs beaten while he was held in Bahrain, and feared torture if he returned.Al-Araibi had been living in Melbourne, Australia, where he was a refugee and played semi-professional soccer, when he traveled to Thailand for his honeymoon in November 2018. Once he arrived in Bangkok, he was detained at the request of Bahrain through an Interpol Red Notice.Thailand’s foreign ministry had said that al-Araibi was detained because Australian authorities had forwarded them an Interpol Red Notice that Bahrain was seeking his arrest. Australian police acknowledged doing so, though it was not clear whether Australia had informed Bahrain that al-Araibi was flying. Bahrain reportedly requested the Red Notice on the same day that al-Araibi received his Thai visa.Story continuesHe was detained in Thailand for three months before being released in February 2019.DIAMOND TYCOON NIRAV MODIA Red Notice was issued on behalf of Indian law enforcement, who accused the businessman's companies of swindling state-owned Punjab National Bank by using bogus financial papers to get loans to purchase and import jewels.
