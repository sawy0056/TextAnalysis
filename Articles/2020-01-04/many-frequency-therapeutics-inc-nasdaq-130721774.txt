(NASDAQ:FREQ) Shares Did Insiders Buy, In The Last Year?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosWe often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term.

However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'.

That single transaction was for US$250k worth of shares at a price of US$14.00 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$17.22. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price.
