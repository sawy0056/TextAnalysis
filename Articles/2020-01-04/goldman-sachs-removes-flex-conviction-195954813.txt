(See his track record here.)The firm's EPS estimates are unchanged and are about in-line with the Street, the analyst said.Flex was added to Goldman's conviction list in June and removed Thursday. During that time, the stock rose 37% versus a 15% gain in the S&P 500. “The increase in the stock price was driven primarily by a higher multiple as Flex was able to expand margins and improve its mix. While the P/E multiple discount versus the history is no longer as substantial as it was in June (at the time Flex was trading at 8X NTM Street EPS versus the historical range of 7X-15X), at the current 9.5X multiple the stock is still below the historical average of 10-11X, and the stock still trades below peers on CY20 EPS,” the analyst said. Price ActionFlex shares were down 1.84% at $12.54 at the time of publication. The stock has a 52-week high of $12.87 and a 52-week low of $7.35.Related Links:Goldman Sachs Upgrades Residential Solar StocksGoldman Sachs Upgrades United Rentals to Buy, Raises Price Target to 5Latest Ratings for FLEX Date Firm Action From To
