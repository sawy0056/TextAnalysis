Zooming out, the annual gain of 154% knocks our socks off.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. See our latest analysis for CropEnergies Does CropEnergies Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 21.68 that there is some investor optimism about CropEnergies. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (10.2) for companies in the oil and gas industry is lower than CropEnergies's P/E.XTRA:CE2 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreCropEnergies's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.CropEnergies's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 100% last year.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.CropEnergies's Balance SheetSince CropEnergies holds net cash of €18m, it can spend on growth, justifying a higher P/E ratio than otherwise.The Verdict On CropEnergies's P/E RatioCropEnergies has a P/E of 21.7. That's around the same as the average in the DE market, which is 21.3. The excess cash it carries is the gravy on top its fast EPS growth. So at a glance we're a bit surprised that CropEnergies does not have a higher P/E ratio. Because analysts are even expecting further profit growth, we would venture this stock is worth a closer look.. What is very clear is that the market has become significantly more optimistic about CropEnergies over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 15.8 back then to 21.7 today. If you like to buy stocks that have recently impressed the market, then this one might be a candidate; but if you prefer to invest when there is 'blood in the streets', then you may feel the opportunity has passed.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
