But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the AST Groupe (EPA:ASP) share price is 56% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 29% in the last year. View our latest analysis for AST Groupe While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the five years of share price growth, AST Groupe moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. We can see that the AST Groupe share price is down 14% in the last three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 10.0% per year. It would appear there's a real mismatch between the increasing EPS and the share price, which has declined -4.9% a year for three years.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).ENXTPA:ASP Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on AST Groupe's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of AST Groupe, it has a TSR of 97% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in AST Groupe had a tough year, with a total loss of 25% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 34%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.
