A stupendous performance by the chipmaker industry in 2019 boosted the overall tech sector. Continued innovation in the chip-making industry last year and China's dependence on U.S.-made chips and semiconductors were pivotal in shaping up the sector’s fortunes.The iShares PHLX Semiconductor index (SOX) rose by as much as 60.1% through 2019. The index’s rally last year was its strongest performance since 2009, mostly driven by strong chip earnings and investors' optimism over a U.S.-China trade agreement.US Chip Design Tech Vital for ChinaA reason behind China's need for U.S. technology is the country's dependency on precise U.S. semiconductor technologies for its technology-intensive supply chains and products.For the development of China's supply chains, the country requires tools that create hardware and software that, in turn, are used in designing integrated circuits (ICs), which enable computer chips to function.The global chip design tools industry is dominated by just four U.S.-based companies namely Synopsys, Inc., Cadence Design Systems, Inc., ANSYS, Inc. and Mentor Graphics. According to S2C data, together, these four companies control 90% of the global market (as of 2018).US-China Trade Deal to Push ChipmakersThis dependency on top-notch U.S. semiconductor companies on China's part makes the U.S. chip industry so critical. Second, since chipmakers form the majority of prominent U.S. companies with revenue exposure to the Asian country, these have also been at the forefront of the U.S.-China trade war.According to Evercore ISI, China was responsible for 35% of global semiconductor sales in 2018 and is the biggest market in the world for chip-enabled products.After all, semiconductors are a crucial component of almost every vital, in-demand tech product. These chip-enabled products are part of everything, including those under the tariff fire. As a trade agreement between the two countries is imminent, the chip-making industry could definitely get a boost as demand for chip-dependent products increases in both countries.The long-fought tariff war is finally deescalating, with the much-awaited phase-one U.S.-China trade deal set to be signed on Jan 15. This agreement is not only expected to protect U.S. intellectual property but will also allow U.S. companies to access the fast-growing China market.4 Funds to BuyWe have, therefore, selected four mutual funds that carry a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and invest in companies that could gain most from the growth in semiconductor industry.
