In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Samudera Shipping Line:0.03 = US$6.7m ÷ (US$282m - US$56m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, Samudera Shipping Line has an ROCE of 3.0%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. How cyclical is Samudera Shipping Line? You can see for yourself by looking at this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.Samudera Shipping Line's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCEShort term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Samudera Shipping Line has total assets of US$282m and current liabilities of US$56m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 20% of its total assets. This is not a high level of current liabilities, which would not boost the ROCE by much.Story continuesOur Take On Samudera Shipping Line's ROCEWhile that is good to see, Samudera Shipping Line has a low ROCE and does not look attractive in this analysis.
