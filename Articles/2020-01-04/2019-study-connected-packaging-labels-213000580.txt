Packaging can also house devices able to sense any changes that take place and store any variable data relating to the way the pack has been handled/used; e.g. a physical change (e.g. tampering or re-filling) or an environmental change (e.g. temperature exposure profile). Connected Packaging can also be achieved with optical devices (e.g.: digitally printed unique codes).RFID/NFC enabled Connected Packaging solutions at an item level have been a long time in coming and scale-up & widespread rollout has so far remained somewhat elusive. The exception, of course, is UHF RFID apparel labels for stock control which has achieved widespread acceptance and has effectively become a standard in many retail outlets around the world today. Nevertheless, in 2019 the industry looks to be largely past the hype cycle phase and the industry is poised to gain more traction in the retail sector.While on the supply side of radio/electronic (both the UHF RFID industry and the NFC) there has been a substantial amount of development & trialing and this has been gathering pace in recent years.Recent technology developments have been resulting in a marked uplift in the industry's prospects, compared to only a few years ago when previously the relatively high unit costs of radio/electronic gateway devices had inclined brand owners to delay adoption.Key Topics CoveredVOLUME 11.
