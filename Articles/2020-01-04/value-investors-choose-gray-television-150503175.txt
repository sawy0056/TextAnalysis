After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Gray Television GTN stock into this equation and findout if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Gray Television has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.95, as you can see in the chart below:View photos This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.33. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Gray Television’s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of12.44 over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. However, the current level stands significantly below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.View photos Moreover, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Market sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.56. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.View photosStory continues We should also point out that Gray Television has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 7.74, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Gray Television’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Gray Television has a P/S ratio of about 1.13. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.52 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.View photos Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Gray Television currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Gray Television a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Gray Television might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of F. This gives GTN a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at the best. The current year consensus estimate increased 43.9% in the past two months, whereas the full year 2020 estimate declined 10%.

Price and ConsensusMoreGray Television, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Gray Television, Inc. QuoteOwing to such bearish estimate trends, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is why we are looking for in- line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineGray Television is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past year, the broader industry has underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:View photos So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity.
