But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term Golden Eagle Retail Group Limited (HKG:3308) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 22% in three years, versus a market return of about 28%. See our latest analysis for Golden Eagle Retail Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Although the share price is down over three years, Golden Eagle Retail Group actually managed to grow EPS by 22% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.It's worth taking a look at other metrics, because the EPS growth doesn't seem to match with the falling share price.We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 16% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching Golden Eagle Retail Group more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SEHK:3308 Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Golden Eagle Retail GroupWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Golden Eagle Retail Group's TSR for the last 3 years was -12%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveGolden Eagle Retail Group shareholders gained a total return of 8.3% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 5.2% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.Golden Eagle Retail Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.
