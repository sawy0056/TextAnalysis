Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.Investors might not know much about Allegion's dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last six years and offers a 0.9% yield. A 0.9% yield is not inspiring, but the longer payment history has some appeal. During the year, the company also conducted a buyback equivalent to around 1.8% of its market capitalisation. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Allegion for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Allegion! NYSE:ALLE Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Allegion paid out 21% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Given the low payout ratio, it is hard to envision the dividend coming under threat, barring a catastrophe.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Allegion's cash payout ratio last year was 23%, which is quite low and suggests that the dividend was thoroughly covered by cash flow. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Allegion's latest financial position,

Looking at the data, we can see that Allegion has been paying a dividend for the past six years. The dividend has been quite stable over the past six years, which is great to see - although we usually like to see the dividend maintained for a decade before giving it full marks, though. During the past six-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.32 in 2014, compared to US$1.08 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 22% per year over this time.We're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Allegion has grown its earnings per share at 67% per annum over the past five years. The company is only paying out a fraction of its earnings as dividends, and in the past been able to use the retained earnings to grow its profits rapidly - an ideal combination.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. First, we like that the company's dividend payments appear well covered, although the retained capital also needs to be effectively reinvested. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the company has not been paying dividends as long as we'd like. All things considered, Allegion looks like a strong prospect. At the right valuation, it could be something special.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
