However, we do note that it only increased their holding by 1.6%, and it wasn't a huge purchase by absolute value, either. See our latest analysis for Beijing Sports and Entertainment Industry Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Beijing Sports and Entertainment Industry GroupIn fact, the recent purchase by Non-Executive Director Yebi Hu was not their only acquisition of Beijing Sports and Entertainment Industry Group shares this year. They previously made an even bigger purchase of HK$300m worth of shares at a price of HK$1.89 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than HK$0.26 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 171.36m shares for HK$320m. But they sold 8435000 for HK$2.6m. In total, Beijing Sports and Entertainment Industry Group insiders bought more than they sold over the last year.
