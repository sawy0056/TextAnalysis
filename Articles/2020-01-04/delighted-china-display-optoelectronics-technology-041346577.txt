With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine China Display Optoelectronics Technology Holdings Limited (HKG:334), by way of a worked example.Our data shows China Display Optoelectronics Technology Holdings has a return on equity of 18% for the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every HK$1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn HK$0.18. View our latest analysis for China Display Optoelectronics Technology Holdings How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for China Display Optoelectronics Technology Holdings:18% = CN¥126m ÷ CN¥708m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does Return On Equity Mean?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does China Display Optoelectronics Technology Holdings Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, China Display Optoelectronics Technology Holdings has a superior ROE than the average (8.2%) company in the Tech industry.SEHK:334 Past Revenue and Net Income, January 3rd 2020MoreThat's clearly a positive. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example, I often check if insiders have been buying shares.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining China Display Optoelectronics Technology Holdings's Debt And Its 18% Return On EquityChina Display Optoelectronics Technology Holdings does use a significant amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.98. Its ROE is quite good but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: China Display Optoelectronics Technology Holdings may not be the best stock to buy.
