So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does Dali Foods Group's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?With net cash of CN¥12b, Dali Foods Group has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business.
