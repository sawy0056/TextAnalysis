(NYSE:MOH) to determine whether it could have potential as an investment idea. In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Molina Healthcare:0.34 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$6.7b - US$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Molina Healthcare has an ROCE of 34%.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Molina Healthcare's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCELiabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Molina Healthcare has total assets of US$6.7b and current liabilities of US$3.3b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 49% of its total assets. Molina Healthcare's ROCE is boosted somewhat by its middling amount of current liabilities.Story continuesOur Take On Molina Healthcare's ROCEDespite this, it reports a high ROCE, and may be worth investigating further.
