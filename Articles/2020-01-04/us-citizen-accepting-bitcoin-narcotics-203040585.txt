Donoghue. “A bright light has been shined on her activities, and she will now be held to account for her charged criminal acts.”Related: Alleged BTC-e Operator Alexander Vinnik to Be Extradited to France: ReportsUnder the pseudonym “RaptureReloaded,” De Alba allegedly sold narcotics on the dark web marketplace Wall Street Market from June 2018 to May 2019. Customers used encrypted email and bitcoin to purchase drugs from De Alba, who marketed various levels of anonymity for packages sent to the U.S. – such as “Basic Stealth,” “Better Stealth” and “Super Stealth 360,” according to the DOJ.In a January 2019, an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent successfully purchased some 40 grams of narcotics from De Alba, receiving a package in Queens, New York, for around $2,000 in bitcoin.The DEA also intercepted five international packages from the Netherlands and Canada containing narcotics addressed to De Alba’s deceased husband in Southern California. The DOJ alleges De Alba had employed her partner’s identify and credit cards to process transactions since his death in March 2018.“Anonymity is what drug dealers rely on in the dark web, but this case proves it’s a false security,” said DEA Special Agent-in-Charge Ray Donovan. “Law enforcement is committed to tracking down drug traffickers’ distribution networks everywhere.”Related: Russia’s Largest Darknet Market Is Hawking an ICO to Fund Global ExpansionIf convicted of all counts, De Alba faces between five and 100 years in prison.Related StoriesNetherlands Plans to Punish Crypto Scammers With Up to 6 Years in JailBrazilian Police Bust Alleged Crypto Fraud That Cost Investors $360MReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextU.S. Moves to Raise Fees for Deportation Appeals by Nearly NinefoldThe Wall Street JournalAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Jesus Would Be Maligned As ‘Radical’ By Today’s CongressHuffPostThe Atlantic Politics Daily: Bernie’s Big VulnerabilityThe AtlanticTrump Spends 45 Minutes With ‘Deep State’ Play Actors Amid Coronavirus MayhemThe Daily BeastChinese scientist sentenced to prison in US for technology theftAFPRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
