To find the best checking accounts for businesses, we evaluated each of the companies’ accounts based on the criteria mentioned below.Few or No Monthly FeesIt’s difficult to find checking accounts that don’t charge monthly fees, but they do exist. For the purpose of this list, we only considered business checking accounts that come with no fees or let you avoid monthly fees with qualified activities, such as a minimum balance or a specific number of transactions each month.Broad ATM AccessATM access is important for many business owners who want to deposit funds, view their balance, or withdraw cash for business expenses on the road. We gave precedence to business checking accounts that came with sizable ATM networks. Checking accounts that come with foreign ATM fee reimbursements also earned high marks.Bonus Cash OffersWhile bonus cash offers only benefit business owners once, we still looked for business checking accounts that offer this benefit. It’s nice to be rewarded for opening a new account, and these offers tend to incentivize consumers to move their business over sooner rather than later.Reasonable Transaction LimitsWe also looked for business checking accounts that allow unlimited transactions, or at least have reasonable transaction limits. Being able to fully utilize your business bank account is crucial, and nobody wants to get hit with unnecessary fees just for making too many deposits or debits.How to Choose the Right Business Checking AccountThe right business checking account for you really depends on how you will typically use your business bank account. These tips can help you ensure you wind up with a new account that works with your money management style and offers the benefits you really want.Check local ATM accessIf you are someone who uses an ATM for business banking often, make sure the new account you choose offers no-fee access to ATMs in your area. Some business checking accounts, like the one we profiled from NBKC Bank, let you use MoneyPass ATMs nationwide free of charge. With a large ATM network, it’s likely you’ll always be close to one you can use.Other banks that offer business checking accounts, like Chase Business Banking, may or may not have ATMs in your area depending on where you live. There are only a handful of Chase ATMs in the entire state of Kansas, for example, which may make this bank a poor option if that’s where you or your company is located.Be realistic about your likely average business checking account balanceMost business bank accounts require a minimum amount of money on deposit in order to avoid monthly maintenance fees. Make sure to read the fine print on each of the accounts listed below to see what this requirement is, and then figure out how much you normally keep on deposit in your business checking account.This step is crucial if you don’t want your business checking balance whittled away by fees each month.Decide whether local bank branches are important to youAlso decide whether you want access to a physical bank branch, which could be important if you like to have a personal relationship with a banker or prefer to make deposits in person. An online bank like Axos Bank may not work well for you if you want personal access, but there are plenty of accounts on this list that come from banks with brick-and-mortar storefronts.If you love in-person banking and don’t want to give it up when you switch business checking accounts, it’s crucial to see which institutions have branches in your area.Summary: Best Business Checking Accounts Business Checking Account“Best Of” CategoryNBKC Bank Best for No Fees Novo Best for No Account Minimums Chase for Business Best Big Bank Business Checking Account Axos Bank Best for Free Checks Huntington Bank Best for Signup Bonus OfferReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
