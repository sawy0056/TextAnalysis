All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Dover Motorsports's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. If you look at the image below, you can see Dover Motorsports has a lower P/E than the average (25.0) in the hospitality industry classification.NYSE:DVD Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Dover Motorsports shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Dover Motorsports shrunk earnings per share by 36% over the last year. But EPS is up 64% over the last 5 years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.So What Does Dover Motorsports's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Dover Motorsports has net cash of US$4.8m. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.The Bottom Line On Dover Motorsports's P/E RatioDover Motorsports has a P/E of 10.2. That's below the average in the US market, which is 18.9. The recent drop in earnings per share would make investors cautious, the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If that occurs, the current low P/E could prove to be temporary.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
