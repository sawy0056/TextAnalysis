Weakness in the U.S. manufacturing sector has dragged on the economy in recent months.In November, spending on private non-residential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, dropped for the third straight month, falling 1.2% to the lowest level since November 2018.Spending on public construction projects rose 0.9% in November. Spending on state and local government construction projects increased 0.8%. Outlays on federal government construction projects - which are only a sliver of overall public construction spending - increased 1.7%.(Reporting by Jason Lange Editing by Paul Simao)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth-quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersWRAPUP 2-U.S. economy grows steadily in Q4, but coronavirus looms largeReutersThe US-China trade war unintentionally prepared companies for coronavirusYahoo FinanceRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
