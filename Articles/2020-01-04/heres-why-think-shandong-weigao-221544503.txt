But as Warren Buffett has mused, 'If you've been playing poker for half an hour and you still don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy.' When they buy such story stocks, investors are all too often the patsy.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer (HKG:1066). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. As a tree reaches steadily for the sky, Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer's EPS has grown 25% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be smiling.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). While we note Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 29% to CN¥9.6b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Given insiders own a small fortune of shares, currently valued at CN¥651m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer with market caps between CN¥28b and CN¥84b is about CN¥4.3m.Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer offered total compensation worth CN¥2.3m to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. While the level of CEO compensation isn't a huge factor in my view of the company, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Story continuesDoes Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders.
