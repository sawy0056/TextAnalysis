View our latest analysis for Deveron UAS Deveron UAS wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.In the last three years, Deveron UAS saw its revenue grow by 101% per year, compound. That's well above most other pre-profit companies. While its revenue increased, the share price dropped at a rate of 9.8% per year. That seems like an unlucky result for holders. It's possible that the prior share price assumed unrealistically high future growth. Still, with high hopes now tempered, now might prove to be an opportunity to buy.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).CNSX:DVR Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreBalance sheet strength is crucial.
