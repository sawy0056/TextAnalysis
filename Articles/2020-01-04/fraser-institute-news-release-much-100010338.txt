For example, when total compensation for the top 1000 CEOs in Canada is compared with the total compensation (including benefits) of workers at those same companies, the pay gap is 81 per cent less than stated in some studies.Myth: CEOs enjoy long careers and receive high levels of compensation for many years.Fact: CEO turnover is very high. In fact, looking at the Globe and Mail’s CEO surveys from 2007 to 2017, of the top 100 CEOs listed in 2007, only 15 of them remained in the top 100 list ten years later.The study also notes that sometimes—for example, in industries with government monopoly charters or protection against foreign competition—CEOs are selected not for their business or leadership skills, but for political reasons.“When a CEO is appointed because of his or her political connections in order to secure government subsidies or keep a market protected from competition, it’s fair to question their compensation because it isn’t being determined in a competitive market,” Geloso said.MEDIA CONTACTS: Vincent Geloso, Senior FellowFraser InstituteTo arrange media interviews or for more information, please contact:Bryn Weese, Associate Director, CommunicationsFraser InstituteTel: (604) 688-0221 ext. 589E-mail: bryn.weese@fraserinstitute.orgFollow the Fraser Institute on Twitter  |  Like us on FacebookThe Fraser Institute is an independent Canadian public policy research and educational organization with offices in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal and ties to a global network of think-tanks in 87 countries.
