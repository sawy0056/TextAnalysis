And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for McCarthy & Stone:0.07 = UK£58m ÷ (UK£963m - UK£135m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2019.)So, McCarthy & Stone has an ROCE of 7.0%.

Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.McCarthy & Stone has total liabilities of UK£135m and total assets of UK£963m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 14% of its total assets.
