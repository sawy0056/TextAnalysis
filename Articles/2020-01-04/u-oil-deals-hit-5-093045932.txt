The data provider valued the Anadarko deal at $57 billion, including debt taken on by the acquirer."Investors who funded the shale revolution over the last decade have become vocal in advocating for payouts and cut back on providing new capital. That flowed through to limited M&A and a negative reaction to deals for much of the year," said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at Enverus.   However, the total M&A spend in 2019 was the highest since 2014, when oil prices peaked at $112 per barrel before beginning a slump that saw prices drop by half of that.Most of the last year's marquee deals focused on the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, which is at the heart of the shale boom that has helped the United States become the world's biggest producer of crude oil.Enverus predicts M&A would rise this year, after ticking up in the fourth quarter of 2019, as smaller players with good land but less access to capital are gobbled up by those with free cash flow. Apart from Occidental-Anadarko, 2019's largest corporate deals in the sector were Callon Petroleum Co's $2.7 billion merger with Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc, WPX Energy Inc's $2.5 billion buy of Felix Energy, and Parsley Energy Inc's $2.3 billion acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy.(Reporting by Shradha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergU.S. Stocks Slide Into a Correction as Virus Fears Show No Sign of EasingThe Wall Street JournalOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Reports Q4 Loss, Tops Revenue EstimatesZacks'Apple Of Oil' Hikes Dividend, Cuts Capex After Bakken Leader Guides Cash Flow LowerInvestor's Business DailyRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
