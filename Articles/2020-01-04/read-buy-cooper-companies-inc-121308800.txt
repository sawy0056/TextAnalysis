See our latest analysis for Cooper Companies How Do You Calculate Cooper Companies's P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Cooper Companies:P/E of 34.22 = $323.32 ÷ $9.45 (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.How Does Cooper Companies's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. The image below shows that Cooper Companies has a lower P/E than the average (45.4) P/E for companies in the medical equipment industry.NYSE:COO Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreCooper Companies's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Cooper Companies's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 232% last year. And earnings per share have improved by 19% annually, over the last three years. So you might say it really deserves to have an above-average P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.So What Does Cooper Companies's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals 11% of Cooper Companies's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Verdict On Cooper Companies's P/E RatioCooper Companies's P/E is 34.2 which is above average (18.9) in its market. While the company does use modest debt, its recent earnings growth is superb.
