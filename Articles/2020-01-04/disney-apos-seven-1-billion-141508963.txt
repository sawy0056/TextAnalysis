And these figures don’t even count the tickets sold by 20th Century Fox, which Disney officially acquired in March.If you included those numbers all of Disney’s studios accounted for $13.1 billion.'STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER' BOX BOOSTS DISNEYThough ticket sales in North America were down 4.4 percent overall, Disney’s films accounted for 38 percent of all domestic moviegoing.The drop in overall ticket sales makes Hollywood cynics believe that the age of streaming is keeping people home. The folks at Disney – which has its own streaming service which will have access to all of Disney’s huge 2019 releases – don’t quite see it that way.“There’s plenty of capacity to bring people to the movie screen,” says Cathleen Taff, distribution chief for Disney. “What I think we’re doing is competing for their time. If it’s not great, they do have other options. But when it is great, people show up. And we’ve seen that this year with seven $1 billion movies.”GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREInvestors seem to agree. Disney stock is up 36 percent compared to a year ago.
