Noticed in the context of the Coinbase Wallet, Apple is pushing back against anything having to do with decentralized applications (dapps).YouTube caused even more of a stir when it took down hundreds of crypto-related videos from prominent influencers without any warning. It later reversed the action, claiming an error, but it was enough to get many to ask: Are decentralized alternatives possible? As if on cue, Justin Sun popped up to announce that Tron had struck a deal through which decentralized Twitch competitor and streaming service DLive would be moving to the Tron Blockchain and integrating with BitTorrent’s BLive streaming service. For many, however, Tron’s involvement makes DLive more likely to end up a centralized tool than a disruptive decentralized social network alternative. Related: MARKETS DAILY: Bitcoin Bouncing After US Airstrike in IraqShow notes and links for Jan. 3, 2020:YouTube (temporarily) takes down crypto contentApple pushes back on dapps in the app storeCrypto community calls for decentralized alternatives to big techDLive moves to Tron blockchainRelated StoriesMARKETS DAILY: Central Bank Digital Currencies and US Dollar Dominance in 2020Taylor Monahan on Crypto’s Divergent Possibilities in 2020MARKETS DAILY HOLIDAYS: Ode to SatoshiReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThis Is What A Cheap Lamborghini Costs To FixMotoriousRachel Whitney Joins Spotify as Nashville Head of EditorialVarietyCourt ruling: YouTube is free to censor 'inappropriate' contentAmerican City Business JournalsSee Taylor Swift transform into a manspreading, tantrum-throwing guy in 'The Man'Yahoo MusicTaylor Swift Really Is ‘The Man’ in Brand-New Music VideoPureWowRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
