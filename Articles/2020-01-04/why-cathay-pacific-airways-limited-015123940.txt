In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Cathay Pacific Airways:0.035 = HK$5.4b ÷ (HK$206b - HK$54b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Cathay Pacific Airways has an ROCE of 3.5%.

Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Cathay Pacific Airways has total assets of HK$206b and current liabilities of HK$54b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 26% of its total assets. This is not a high level of current liabilities, which would not boost the ROCE by much.Our Take On Cathay Pacific Airways's ROCEStory continuesWhile that is good to see, Cathay Pacific Airways has a low ROCE and does not look attractive in this analysis.
