But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 70% in that half decade. View our latest analysis for Texwinca Holdings To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Looking back five years, both Texwinca Holdings's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 13% per year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 21% per year, over the period. This implies that the market was previously too optimistic about the stock. The low P/E ratio of 7.89 further reflects this reticence.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:321 Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Texwinca Holdings's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Texwinca Holdings's TSR for the last 5 years was -50%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveTexwinca Holdings shareholders are down 14% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 14%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 13% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
