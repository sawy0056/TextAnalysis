(TSE:KEY) Before You Read ThisSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosThe goal of this article is to teach you how to use price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). To keep it practical, we'll show how Keyera Corp.'s (TSE:KEY) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Keyera has a P/E ratio of 12.70, based on the last twelve months. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying CA$12.70 for every CA$1 in prior year profit. View our latest analysis for Keyera How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Keyera:P/E of 12.70 = CA$34.17 ÷ CA$2.69 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each CA$1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Keyera Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Keyera has a higher P/E than the average (10.6) P/E for companies in the oil and gas industry.TSX:KEY Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Keyera will outperform other companies in its industry. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.In the last year, Keyera grew EPS like Taylor Swift grew her fan base back in 2010; the 73% gain was both fast and well deserved. And earnings per share have improved by 33% annually, over the last three years. So you might say it really deserves to have an above-average P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Is Debt Impacting Keyera's P/E?Keyera's net debt equates to 36% of its market capitalization. You'd want to be aware of this fact, but it doesn't bother us.The Verdict On Keyera's P/E RatioKeyera trades on a P/E ratio of 12.7, which is below the CA market average of 15.9. The company does have a little debt, and EPS growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
