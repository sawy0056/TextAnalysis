But along the way some stocks are going to perform badly. Zooming in on an example, the Kenmare Resources plc (LON:KMR) share price dropped 58% in the last half decade. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. On the other hand, we note it's up 8.9% in about a month. However, this may be a matter of broader market optimism, since stocks are up 7.2% in the same time. View our latest analysis for Kenmare Resources To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Kenmare Resources moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.The modest 1.7% dividend yield is unlikely to be guiding the market view of the stock. In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 13% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).LSE:KMR Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year.
