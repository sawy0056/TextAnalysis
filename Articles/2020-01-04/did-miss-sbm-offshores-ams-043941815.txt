To wit, the SBM Offshore share price has climbed 82% in five years, easily topping the market return of 34% (ignoring dividends).

Check out our latest analysis for SBM Offshore While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years of share price growth, SBM Offshore moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).ENXTAM:SBMO Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreWe know that SBM Offshore has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for SBM Offshore the TSR over the last 5 years was 94%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that SBM Offshore shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times.
