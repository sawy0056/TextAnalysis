We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping SA's (ATH:KYRI), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 26.25. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 3.8%. Check out our latest analysis for Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping:P/E of 26.25 = €1.93 ÷ €0.07 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each €1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping has a higher P/E than the average (20.7) P/E for companies in the hospitality industry.ATSE:KYRI Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping shrunk earnings per share by 34% over the last year.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping's net debt is 15% of its market cap. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.The Bottom Line On Kiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping's P/E RatioKiriacoulis Mediterranean Cruises Shipping's P/E is 26.2 which is above average (16.6) in its market.
