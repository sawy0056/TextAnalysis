The new 13.3-inch display LAVIE Pro Mobile in the color Bordeaux, offering exceptional portability.
The LAVIE Pro Mobile is the ultimate device for professionals on the move with its compact design and exceptional portability. The super lightweight 1.85lbs/837g laptop with a 0.62"/15.5mm ultra-slim body and lift-up hinge keyboard offers portability with a long battery run-time of up to 15 hours, in mobile benchmark tests - allowing users to work anywhere at any time. Usually design is compromised to pursue durability and weight, but this model ticks all the boxes.
While the top cover is made of Toray's high stiffness racing car grade carbon, the bottom case is made of light-weight magnesium lithium array - initially, exclusively used in the aerospace industry and later pioneered by NEC PC for commercial use in 2012.
Topped with a magnesium array keyboard case designed by top Japanese craftsmen, the LAVIE Pro Mobile combines beautiful minimalist design with exceptional lightness. Price and availability: Starting at 1,599.99 USD, the device will be available in the US in March 2020.
LAVIE HOME All-in-One: A Perfect Addition to your Home
LAVIE Home All-in-one, equipped with 10th gen Intel U Processor and 4 array far-field mic for voice control.
The LAVIE Home All-in-One is an all-in-one PC for users who want to enjoy high-quality entertainment with family or friends without crouching around a small screen. Staying true to the LAVIE portfolio, its design and function blends in perfectly with a home environment. With speakers embedded in the display, the PC is like a piece of glass that can complement your home's interiors. The Crystal Sound Display developed by LG Display, a technology leader in TV displays, generates a clear and better directed sound by vibrating the display. The high-performance, noiseless immersive display, and voice-operated control also offers the option to use Intel's Wake On Voice function to control the PC, even when Windows system is shut down. Price and availability: Starting at 1,799.99 USD, the device will be available in the US in March 2020. Details of the Japanese edition will be revealed later.
LAVIE VEGA: Power-packed, for Work and Home
LAVIE VEGA with its 15.6" 4k OLED display is the best PC for both business and personal use.
Looking for a device for office and home? The LAVIE VEGA packs a punch without compromising on looks.
Its Gorilla Glass® 6 back cover gives it a reflective deep blue alumite finish. But the glass serves another special function called Smart Light. The LAVIE logo at the top has an LED built inside that works like a smart speaker, supported by Microsoft's Cortana with Modern Standby. Even when your laptop is closed and on sleep mode, the far field mic can pick up voice commands and activate Microsoft's Cortana to kick-start apps.
If you use a PC as a music player, LAVIE VEGA also offers a powerful YAMAHA sound system co-designed by YAMAHA's team of leading sound masters. Price and availability: Starting at 2,099.99USD, the device will be available in the US in March 2020. Details of the Japanese edition will be revealed later.
