Tensions in the Gulf region escalated with Tehran vowing to avenge the death of General Soleimani and its allies in Iraq pressing to expel US troops from the country. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi condemned the overnight strike, calling it a flagrant breach of the terms underwriting the presence of US forces in the country. The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes, the deputy head of the Popular Mobilization Forces, which is an umbrella for dozens of militias that are part of the Iraqi security apparatus but include factions that swear allegiance to Iran’s supreme leader.Manufacturing Activity Drops to 10-year LowsManufacturing activity continued to falter in December according to the Institute for Supply Management.
