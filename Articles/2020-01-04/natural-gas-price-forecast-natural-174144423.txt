However, we have turned around to show signs of life again and it’s very likely that the market is starting to get to be a bit overextended. Ultimately, by forming the candlestick that it has we could see a bit of a bounce, but I would treat that as only a short-term trade. We are at extreme low right now, so that makes quite a bit of sense. The $2.00 level underneath should be a massive “floor” in the market.NATGAS Video 06.01.20All of that being said, this was helped by a natural gas storage figure at -58 billion, as opposed to the expected -60 billion. With that in mind, it’s likely that we could see this market return to the $2.20 level, and perhaps even try to overtake it. If it does, then a move to the $2.30 level is possible. That being said, I would be looking to short any rallies that show signs of exhaustion as warmer than anticipated temperatures continue to be a major problem across the lower 48 in the United States. If we were to somehow break down below the $2.00 level, that would be catastrophic for the natural gas markets, because it is such a large, round, psychologically significant figure, breaking down below there would of course cause a chain reaction. It is also a large options barrier so it should be watched. Natural gas has had a horrific winter, and it looks like even though a bounce is somewhat imminent, this won’t change.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
