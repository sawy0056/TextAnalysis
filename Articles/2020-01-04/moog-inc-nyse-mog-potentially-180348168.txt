(NYSE:MOG.A) Potentially Undervalued?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosMoog Inc. (NYSE:MOG.A), which is in the aerospace & defense business, and is based in United States, saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Moog’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Moog Is Moog still cheap?Great news for investors – Moog is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $129.73, but it is currently trading at US$88.02 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Moog’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Moog look like?NYSE:MOG.A Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
