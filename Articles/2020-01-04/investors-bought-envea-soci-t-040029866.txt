The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Envea Société anonyme's TSR for the last 5 years was 204%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Envea Société anonyme shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 83% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 25% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
