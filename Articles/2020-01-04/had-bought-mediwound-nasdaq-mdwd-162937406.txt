But unfortunately, some companies simply don't succeed. Zooming in on an example, the MediWound Ltd. (NASDAQ:MDWD) share price dropped 57% in the last half decade. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 29% in the last year. The silver lining is that the stock is up 2.3% in about a week. View our latest analysis for MediWound While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.MediWound became profitable within the last five years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.Revenue is actually up 76% over the time period.

Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 16% over the last half decade.
