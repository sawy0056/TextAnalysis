"They both gather information, they both are willing to provide services, they both have a mechanism by which to make some determination to speak to witnesses, and yet they have ultimately no real authority to turn in someone or make a local complaint with law enforcement."Miltenberg, the Title IX lawyer, said Uber has put itself in a "moral quagmire" by serving as a witness to potential crimes that it has no obligation to share with anyone else in real time. The problem could only become more prominent as Uber takes increasing measures, such as piloting audio recording for safety, that could capture evidence of potential crimes on a massive scale.Read the full article at:https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/23/uber-knows-more-about-its-rape-problem-than-anyone-else-what-should-it-do-with-that-data/Andrew Miltenberg is a New York attorney who specializes in Title IX and campus assault due process, having filed more Title IX lawsuits than any single law firm in the country.  Widely recognized as a pioneer in the field, he is currently engaged in several groundbreaking Title IX cases, including a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against Michigan State University.CisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/title-ix-expert-miltenberg-weighs-in-on-legal-issues-surrounding-ubers-data-on-sexual-assault-300980986.htmlSOURCE Nesenoff & Miltenberg, LLPReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextUS health workers exposed to virus without protective gear: reportsAFPJanet Mock & Ryan Murphy Team On Netflix Film About Former Washington Post Journalist Janet CookeDeadlinePence Says He’s in Charge of U.S. Virus Response, Not HHS’s AzarBloombergICE Is Running Millions of Facial-Recognition Scans on Driver's-License PhotosCar and DriverFilmmaker Polanski will not attend 'French Oscars' in Paris over criticismReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
