But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term Meredith Corporation (NYSE:MDP) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 46% in three years, versus a market return of about 50%. The more recent news is of little comfort, with the share price down 39% in a year. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 11% in the last three months. View our latest analysis for Meredith To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years that the share price fell, Meredith's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 7.2% each year. The share price decline of 19% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:MDP Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Meredith, it has a TSR of -39% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Meredith had a tough year, with a total loss of 36% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 34%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 5.3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
