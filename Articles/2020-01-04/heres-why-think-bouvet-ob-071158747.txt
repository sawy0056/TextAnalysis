Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like Bouvet (OB:BOUVET). Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing.

With a whopping kr611m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success.
