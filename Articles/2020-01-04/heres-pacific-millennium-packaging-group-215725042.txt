Investors can purchase shares before the 8th of January in order to be eligible for this dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of January.Pacific Millennium Packaging Group's next dividend payment will be HK$0.15 per share, which looks like a nice increase on last year, when the company distributed a total of HK$0.088 to shareholders.

Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Pacific Millennium Packaging Group's earnings per share have risen 16% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Pacific Millennium Packaging Group also issued more than 5% of its market cap in new stock during the past year, which we feel is likely to hurt its dividend prospects in the long run. It's hard to grow dividends per share when a company keeps creating new shares.Given that Pacific Millennium Packaging Group has only been paying a dividend for a year, there's not much of a past history to draw insight from.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Pacific Millennium Packaging Group? We love that Pacific Millennium Packaging Group is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.Story continuesWant to learn more about Pacific Millennium Packaging Group's dividend performance?
