But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Huntsworth plc (LON:HNT) share price has soared 103% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite. Meanwhile the share price is 1.8% higher than it was a week ago.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Huntsworth's TSR for the last 3 years was 119%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 23% in the last year, Huntsworth shareholders lost 22% (even including dividends) . However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years.
