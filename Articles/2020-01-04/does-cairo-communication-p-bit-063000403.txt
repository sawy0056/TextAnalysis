is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Cairo Communication:P/E of 6.81 = €2.78 ÷ €0.41 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each €1 the company has earned over the last year.

Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Cairo Communication saw earnings per share decrease by 11% last year.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting Cairo Communication's P/E?Net debt is 30% of Cairo Communication's market cap. You'd want to be aware of this fact, but it doesn't bother us.The Bottom Line On Cairo Communication's P/E RatioCairo Communication trades on a P/E ratio of 6.8, which is below the IT market average of 18.8. The debt levels are not a major concern, but the lack of EPS growth is likely weighing on sentiment.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
