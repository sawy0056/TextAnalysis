And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Bank of Hawaii Corporation (NYSE:BOH) share price is up 65% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 52% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 41% , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for Bank of Hawaii There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Bank of Hawaii managed to grow its earnings per share at 8.3% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 11% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:BOH Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Bank of Hawaii's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Bank of Hawaii the TSR over the last 5 years was 90%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Bank of Hawaii shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 41% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
