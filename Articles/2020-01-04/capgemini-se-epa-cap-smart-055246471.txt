How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.While Capgemini's 1.5% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. The company also bought back stock during the year, equivalent to approximately 1.0% of the company's market capitalisation at the time. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Capgemini for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ENXTPA:CAP Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Capgemini paid out 35% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Capgemini's cash payout ratio last year was 20%, which is quite low and suggests that the dividend was thoroughly covered by cash flow. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.We update our data on Capgemini every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Capgemini has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €1.00 in 2010, compared to €1.70 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 5.4% per year over this time.Businesses that can grow their dividends at a decent rate and maintain a stable payout can generate substantial wealth for shareholders over the long term.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Capgemini has grown its earnings per share at 12% per annum over the past five years. A company paying out less than a quarter of its earnings as dividends, and growing earnings at more than 10% per annum, looks to be right in the cusp of its growth phase. At the right price, we might be interested.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. It's great to see that Capgemini is paying out a low percentage of its earnings and cash flow. Next, growing earnings per share and steady dividend payments is a great combination. Overall, we think there are a lot of positives to Capgemini from a dividend perspective.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
