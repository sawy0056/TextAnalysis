They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!" Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday.Last Sunday, the U.S. forces carried out five strikes at bases controlled by Iran-backed Shia militia Kata'ib Hezbollah in Iraq and Syria.Oil Price ActionThe oil prices rose sharply after the reports of the airstrike.
