You should think about starting with Dreyfus Small Cap Stock Index Investor (DISSX). DISSX has no Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, but we have been able to look into other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerDreyfus Premier is based in New York, NY, and is the manager of DISSX. The Dreyfus Small Cap Stock Index Investor made its debut in June of 1997 and DISSX has managed to accumulate roughly $1.69 billion in assets, as of the most recently available information. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 8.99%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 7.93%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 8.46%, the standard deviation of DISSX over the past three years is 16.51%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 16.02% compared to the category average of 8.96%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors cannot discount the risks to this segment though, as it is always important to remember the downside for any potential investment. DISSX lost 51.03% in the most recent bear market and underperformed comparable funds by 8%. This could mean that the fund is a worse choice than comparable funds during a bear market.Nevertheless, investors should also note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.13, which means it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&P 500. With a negative alpha of -2.49, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.HoldingsExploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States.As of the last filing date, the mutual fund has 97.65% of its assets in stocks, which have an average market capitalization of $1.95 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:FinanceIndustrial CyclicalTechnologyTurnover is 18.02%, which means, on average, the fund makes fewer trades than comparable funds.ExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, DISSX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.50% compared to the category average of 0.86%. DISSX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $2,500, and each subsequent investment should be at least $100.Bottom LineThis could just be the start of your research on DISSXin the Index category.
