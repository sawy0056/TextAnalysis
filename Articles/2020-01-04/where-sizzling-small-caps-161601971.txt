That includes emerging markets, such as Brazil.Consider the VanEck Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (BRF) , which surged more than 31% last year and jumped another 2% on Thursday. BRF's 2019 showing was undoubtedly impressive, but there could be more in store for Brazilian small-cap stocks in 2020.BRF seeks to replicate the price and yield performance of the MVIS Brazil Small-Cap Index, which includes securities of Brazilian small-capitalization companies.
