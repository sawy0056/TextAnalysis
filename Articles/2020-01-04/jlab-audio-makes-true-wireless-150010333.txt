Offering 20+ hours playtime and a wallet-friendly MSRP of $29.99, GO Air is the smallest true wireless product JLab has ever created. The GO Air features dual connect, incorporating dual microphones that  allow the earbuds to be used individually while the other remains in the charging case. Four color options (black, white, navy and army green) will be available in March 2020 at retail stores nationwide and jlabaudio.com."JLab’s GO Air are the smallest and most affordable true wireless earbuds we’ve ever designed,” said JLab CEO Win Cramer. “JLab is not slowing down when it comes to providing consumers with accessible, innovative options – and GO Air is a testament to our vision for making true wireless available for everyone. Don’t be fooled by the price, while affordable, these earbuds pack a punch in both battery life, sound, and feature rich tech including our patented built-in EQ3 sound profiles."JLab is the #1 true wireless brand under $100 in the US*, a testament to creating products that are not just affordable, but also high quality and packed with features typically found in products double or triple the cost. Featuring a 20% smaller body than JLab’s best-selling JBuds Air, GO Air offers a slimmer profile great for small ears. The longer earbud stem provides a snug in-ear fit, and comes with three sizes of gel tips so users can customize the fit to each ear. Focused on convenience and accessibility, the GO Air’s charging case measures under three inches by one inch and is designed with an integrated charging cable. JLab’s patented cable design ensures you never lose the cable or need to find another to recharge your case. Touch sensors let you choose the sound profile to match your personal preference between different sound levels, adjust volume, and answer calls.GO Air Specs:5-hour Bluetooth battery life in each earbud + 15 hours in included charging caseDual ConnectIntegrated charging cable in case370 mAh charging caseBluetooth 5EQ3 Sound: Signature, Balanced, Bass Boost3 gel ear tips (small, medium, large)2-year warrantyTouch Controls: play, pause, track forward, track back, adjust volumeBuilt-in MEMs microphone: take calls or activate Siri or Google AssistantIPX4 Sweat ResistanceAuto On and Connect8mm driversAbout JLab AudioJLab Audio is an award-winning designer of personal audio including earbuds, headphones and Bluetooth™ speakers.
