We'll look at Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited's (HKG:1171) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Yanzhou Coal Mining has a P/E ratio of 3.39, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 29.5%. View our latest analysis for Yanzhou Coal Mining How Do I Calculate Yanzhou Coal Mining's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share (in the reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Yanzhou Coal Mining:P/E of 3.39 = HK$6.41 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, CNY ) ÷ HK$1.89 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Yanzhou Coal Mining Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that Yanzhou Coal Mining has a lower P/E than the average (6.7) P/E for companies in the oil and gas industry.SEHK:1171 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreYanzhou Coal Mining's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Notably, Yanzhou Coal Mining grew EPS by a whopping 26% in the last year. And earnings per share have improved by 20% annually, over the last five years. So we'd generally expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting Yanzhou Coal Mining's P/E?Net debt totals 79% of Yanzhou Coal Mining's market cap. This is a reasonably significant level of debt -- all else being equal you'd expect a much lower P/E than if it had net cash.The Verdict On Yanzhou Coal Mining's P/E RatioYanzhou Coal Mining's P/E is 3.4 which is below average (10.7) in the HK market. While the EPS growth last year was strong, the significant debt levels reduce the number of options available to management. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
