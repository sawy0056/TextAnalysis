We'll look at Funkwerk AG's (FRA:FEW) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Funkwerk has a P/E ratio of 20.60, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 4.9%. View our latest analysis for Funkwerk How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Funkwerk:P/E of 20.60 = €19.00 ÷ €0.92 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.How Does Funkwerk's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that Funkwerk has a higher P/E than the average (16.6) P/E for companies in the communications industry.DB:FEW Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Funkwerk will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.In the last year, Funkwerk grew EPS like Taylor Swift grew her fan base back in 2010; the 69% gain was both fast and well deserved.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Funkwerk's Balance SheetWith net cash of €30m, Funkwerk has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 20% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On Funkwerk's P/E RatioFunkwerk's P/E is 20.6 which is about average (21.3) in the DE market. The excess cash it carries is the gravy on top its fast EPS growth. So at a glance we're a bit surprised that Funkwerk does not have a higher P/E ratio.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.
