(NASDAQ:MANH), which is in the software business, and is based in United States, received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$86.64 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$74.60. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Manhattan Associates's current trading price of US$80.68 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Manhattan Associates’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Manhattan Associates What is Manhattan Associates worth?Great news for investors – Manhattan Associates is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $139.64, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Manhattan Associates’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Manhattan Associates generate?NasdaqGS:MANH Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -14% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Manhattan Associates.
