The Company received approximately $1.2 million from financing activities during the quarter."Our aftermarket service, DSS program, and long-term rental business continues to grow as we planned and is driving the majority of our future margin expansion. Product shipments ebbed during the quarter as many U.S. businesses pushed projects into 2020. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding BREXIT delayed multiple project decisions in the European Union, which are now expected to close since the recent election in the UK," said Darren Jamison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Capstone."Based on the continued growth of our aftermarket business we remain committed to achieving our stated goal of reaching positive Adjusted EBITDA in the June 2020 quarter as we continue to make progress on improving our core business model in the areas focused on reoccurring revenues and building a sustainable and profitable business to support our long-term growth and profitability plans," added Mr. Jamison.Capstone's preliminary results show total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by approximately 3%, to $17.4 million compared to $18.0 million in the same period last year. Capstone's preliminary product revenue decreased approximately 22% compared to the same period last year, to approximately $7.9 million. Preliminary accessories, parts, aftermarket service, long-term rental, and Distributor Support System (DSS) revenue increased by approximately 20% compared to the same period last year, to approximately $9.5 million. The decrease in product revenue is expected to negatively impact the net loss and EBITDA results for the quarter.Strategic Changes to Internal Sales & Marketing Organization:Capstone has divided its sales and marketing team into two separate organizations. One stand-alone organization will remain focused on developing and managing the existing worldwide distribution channel and will be led by Jen Derstine, who was promoted to Vice President of Marketing and Distribution. Additionally, Ms. Derstine will lead all marketing activities as we continue building Capstone into a strong and recognizable worldwide brand.The second stand-alone organization will be led by Jim Crouse, who was recently promoted to Chief Revenue Officer and is responsible for growing Capstone's national account business and long-term rental fleet. Additionally, Mr. Crouse will be responsible for business development, licensing, and new product partnerships - with a focus on new fuels such as hydrogen and further growing our renewable market segment participation."With these new strategic organizational changes, we aim to drive improved year-over-year revenue growth. Our goal is to support continued development of our existing distribution network which is serving customers in 73 countries while concurrently devoting dedicated Capstone direct business development resources to expanding our current 7 MW long-term rental fleet to 10 MW and beyond while building closer corporate ties to large, multinational customers to drive incremental direct sales opportunities and increased future product revenue growth," concluded Mr. Jamison.About Capstone Turbine CorporationCapstone Turbine Corporation (www.capstoneturbine.com) (CPST) is the world's leading producer of highly efficient, low-emission, resilient microturbine energy systems.
