Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.A 2.6% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests EnGro has some staying power. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on EnGro! SGX:S44 Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, EnGro paid out 32% of its profit as dividends. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. EnGro paid out 787% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. EnGro paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were EnGro to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.With a strong net cash balance, EnGro investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of EnGro's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of EnGro's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was S$0.03 in 2010, compared to S$0.025 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 1.8% a year during that period.When a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.Story continuesDividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. EnGro's EPS have fallen by approximately 19% per year during the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective, as even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that EnGro's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we like EnGro's low dividend payout ratio, although we're a bit concerned that it paid out a substantially higher percentage of its free cash flow. It's not great to see earnings per share shrinking. The dividends have been relatively consistent, but we wonder for how much longer this will be true. Ultimately, EnGro comes up short on our dividend analysis. It's not that we think it is a bad company - just that there are likely more appealing dividend prospects out there on this analysis.See if management have their own wealth at stake, by checking insider shareholdings in EnGro stock.Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
