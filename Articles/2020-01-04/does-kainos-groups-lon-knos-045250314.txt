That brought the twelve month gain to a very sharp 90%.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. Check out our latest analysis for Kainos Group How Does Kainos Group's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?Kainos Group's P/E of 47.81 indicates some degree of optimism towards the stock. As you can see below, Kainos Group has a higher P/E than the average company (30.8) in the it industry.LSE:KNOS Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Kainos Group will outperform other companies in its industry. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Kainos Group increased earnings per share by a whopping 47% last year. And earnings per share have improved by 13% annually, over the last five years. With that performance, I would expect it to have an above average P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does Kainos Group's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Kainos Group has net cash of UK£41m. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.The Bottom Line On Kainos Group's P/E RatioKainos Group's P/E is 47.8 which is above average (18.4) in its market. The excess cash it carries is the gravy on top its fast EPS growth. So based on this analysis we'd expect Kainos Group to have a high P/E ratio. What is very clear is that the market has become significantly more optimistic about Kainos Group over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 36.1 back then to 47.8 today. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it.
