That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower - currently under 2% and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.The impact of this rate decline is sizeable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren't producing income? You can only cut your expenses so far, and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant current low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.For example, AT&T and Coca-Cola are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3% or better. Look for stocks like this that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Federated Investors (FII) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.27 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.29%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Management industry's yield of 2.3% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.78%. In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.08 is flat compared to last year.Invesco (IVZ) is paying out a dividend of 0.31 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 6.89% compared to the Financial - Investment Management industry's yield of 2.3% and the S&P 500's yield. Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.24 is up 3.33% from last year.Currently paying a dividend of 0.44 per share, MetLife (MET) has a dividend yield of 3.41%. This is compared to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.41% and the S&P 500's current yield. Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.76 is up 4.76% from last year.But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Story continuesGenerating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement.To learn more ways to maximize your assets - and avoid pitfalls that could jeopardize your financial security - download our free report:Will You Retire a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do NowThis helpful guide offers our viewpoints about strategic retirement investment planning, based on decades of experience helping our clients prepare for financial security during their golden years.
