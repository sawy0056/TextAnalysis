However, the annual gain of 2.9% wasn't so impressive.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious).

That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account.
