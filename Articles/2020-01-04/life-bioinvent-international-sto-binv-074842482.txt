But the long term shareholders of BioInvent International AB (publ) (STO:BINV) have had an unfortunate run in the last three years. Sadly for them, the share price is down 60% in that time. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 42% in the last year. The good news is that the stock is up 1.8% in the last week. Check out our latest analysis for BioInvent International Given that BioInvent International didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.Over three years, BioInvent International grew revenue at 0.6% per year. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. It's likely this weak growth has contributed to an annualised return of 26% for the last three years. When a stock falls hard like this, some investors like to add the company to a watchlist (in case the business recovers, longer term). Keep in mind it isn't unusual for good businesses to have a tough time or a couple of uninspiring years.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).OM:BINV Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreThis free interactive report on BioInvent International's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between BioInvent International's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. We note that BioInvent International's TSR, at -60% is higher than its share price return of -60%. When you consider it hasn't been paying a dividend, this data suggests shareholders have benefitted from a spin-off, or had the opportunity to acquire attractively priced shares in a discounted capital raising.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in BioInvent International had a tough year, with a total loss of 42%, against a market gain of about 38%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 13% per year over five years. We realise that Buffett has said investors should 'buy when there is blood on the streets', but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality businesses.
