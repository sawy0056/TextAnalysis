But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like CGI (TSE:GIB.A), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. Check out our latest analysis for CGI How Quickly Is CGI Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, CGI has grown EPS by 9.7% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note CGI's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 5.3% to CA$12b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of CGI's forecast profits?Are CGI Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a CA$29b company like CGI. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enormous stake in the company, worth CA$536m. This suggests to me that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!Is CGI Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for CGI is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Just as polish makes silverware pop, the high level of insider ownership enhances my enthusiasm for this growth. That combination appeals to me, for one. So yes, I do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of CGI.Although CGI certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
