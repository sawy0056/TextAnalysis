MSCI (MSCI), which belongs to the Zacks Business - Software Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this maker of software tools to help portfolio managers make investment decisions has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 4.51%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, MSCI came out with earnings of $1.68 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 per share, representing a surprise of 5.66%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.54 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.36%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for MSCI lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.MSCI has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain.
