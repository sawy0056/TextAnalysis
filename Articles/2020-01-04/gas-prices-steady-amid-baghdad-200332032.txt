CarterFox BusinessJanuary 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareU.S. gas prices have remained mostly steady following an American airstrike that killed a top Iranian military chief, but costs could pick up if conflicts in the Middle East continue.As of press time, according to the American Automobile Association, oil futures rose 3.7 percent to $63.44 and the national price of gas hit $2.59, up 3 cents from last week.

And all of this was left without any sort of military response by the United States or Saudi Arabia,” he said. “Now we do have a response. The calculus has changed. In all the provocations in 2019, we did not get a response in oil because there was no response by the United States.”CLICK HERE TO GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GOAnd while oil prices have increased in response to the airstrike, the United States is operating as “more of a natural-gas based economy," Schork said. "So, certainly, it's going to have an effect but not to the degree that you would have expected, say, 10 years ago.”CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSRelated ArticlesHow Much is Michael Phelps Worth?Ryan Lochte's Brand Value Sinks Amid Rio ScandalHere's How You Get a Body Like An OlympianReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; WHO Sees ‘Decisive’ Stage: Virus UpdateBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2014 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersAt least 7 Iranian government officials have coronavirusThe WeekWorld prepares for coronavirus pandemic; global recession forecastReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
