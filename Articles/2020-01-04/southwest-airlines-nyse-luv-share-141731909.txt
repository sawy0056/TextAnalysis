Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) share price is up 31% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. On a brighter note, more newer shareholders are probably rather content with the 20% share price gain over twelve months.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.
