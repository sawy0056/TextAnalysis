"Whether it turns into a theme depends on Iran's reaction and then the U.S. response."Iran promised harsh revenge. The Quds Force and its paramilitary proxies have ample means to mount a response.In September, U.S. officials blamed Iran for attacking the oil installations of Saudi Aramco, the state energy giant and the world's largest oil exporter. Iran has denied responsibility for the strikes and accused Washington of warmongering.The Trump administration then did not respond, beyond heated rhetoric and threats, and markets settled down within a week after Brent surged 14.6%, its biggest one-day percentage gain since at least 1988, on Sept. 16.The U.S. government and others on Friday urged their citizens in the region either to return home or to stay away from potential targets and public gatherings.President Hassan Rouhani said the killing would stiffen Iran's resistance to the United States.Pompeo said in a round of TV interviews that the United States remained committed to de-escalation with Iran but that it had needed to defend itself."He (Soleimani) was actively plotting in the region to take actions - a big action as he described it - that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk. We know it was imminent," Pompeo told CNN.Stocks on Wall Street opened down 1%, the lowest point of the session, as losses were later pared a bit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 233.92 points, or 0.81%, to 28,634.88.
