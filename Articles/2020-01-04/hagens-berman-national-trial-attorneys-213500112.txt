(ACB) investors who have suffered losses in excess of $500,000 to submit their losses now to learn if they qualify to recover compensable damages. The January 21, 2020 lead plaintiff deadline in a securities fraud class action that has been filed against the company and senior executives is fast approaching. Hagens Berman is investigating whether the fraudulent period extends beyond that alleged in the complaint.Relevant Period: Oct. 23, 2018 - Nov. 14, 2019Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Jan. 21, 2019Sign Up: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/ACBContact An Attorney Now: ACB@hbsslaw.com844-916-0895Aurora Cannabis (ACB) Class Action:The complaint alleges that Defendants misled investors about Aurora Cannabis' business and prospects.More specifically, according to the complaint, Defendants misleadingly and repeatedly touted the Company's continuing revenue ramp quarter-to-quarter. In addition, as recently as Oct. 3, 2019, the Company provided investors a construction update on its operations and growth initiatives, including on its Aurora Sun and Aurora Nordic 2 projects, touting that Aurora continues to progress construction of the "Sky Class" facilities.But on Nov. 14, 2019, Aurora Cannabis shocked investors when it announced wider than expected losses and that revenue had declined by 24% quarter over quarter. In addition, the cash-strapped Company disclosed it would be halting construction immediately at its Aurora Nordic 2 and Aurora Sun facilities. MarketWatch reported, "[a]nalysts said that investors had a reason for anger and distrust." An analyst at Jeffries reportedly noted, "With possible cash pressures evident, announcing ceased construction at facilities despite a press release just 6 weeks ago praising progression, and now EBITDA (and cash) positive looking unlikely this year, it would be fair for investors not to believe them."This news sent the price of Aurora Cannabis shares plummeting about 17% on November 15, 2019, the largest single-day percentage decline for Aurora shares in more than five years and the lowest closing price since October 2017.Most recently, on Dec. 21, 2019, Defendants announced that Cam Battley stepped down as Chief Corporate Officer effective December 20, 2019. This news sent the price of Aurora Cannabis shares plummeting over 10% on Dec. 23, 2019.If you purchased shares of Aurora Cannabis and suffered significant losses, click here to discuss your legal rights with Hagens Berman."We're focused on recovering investors' losses and whether Aurora Cannabis misled investors about its operations and growth initiatives," said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.Whistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Aurora Cannabis should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.
