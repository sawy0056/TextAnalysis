(NASDAQ:WING) to determine whether it could have potential as an investment idea. Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.First, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Wingstop:0.33 = US$44m ÷ (US$168m - US$37m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, Wingstop has an ROCE of 33%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts.

To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Wingstop has total liabilities of US$37m and total assets of US$168m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 22% of its total assets. A minimal amount of current liabilities limits the impact on ROCE.Our Take On Wingstop's ROCELow current liabilities and high ROCE is a good combination, making Wingstop look quite interesting.
