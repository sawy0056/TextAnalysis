The center typically welcomes patients from Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Jersey, and other locations. John Amato, DDS, MD, a Plastic Surgeon and the founder and medical director of the Vanish Center reports, "This type of surgery has become a rewarding and much-welcomed area of expertise for us. We are grateful for each opportunity to provide the highest level of care for our patients".The center provides treatment for many types of skin abnormalities including: moles, cysts, scars, keloids, torn earlobes, post-Mohs defects, vascular lesions, cleft lip & Palate, lacerations, and burns. The treatment modalities include such procedures as: incisionless removal, precision shave, scar revision, earlobe repair, keloid treatment, surgical excision, and reconstruction. Details about the procedures can be found at https://vanishcenter.comUsing the Vanish protocols, minor procedures such as mole removal or skin removal can take as little as 7-10 minutes, and they can be performed the same day as the consultation with no downtime. More complex procedures such as post-mohs reconstruction are performed in an on-site surgery center. Only major surgeries like the repair of a cleft lip & palate require treatment in an operating room. None of the procedures performed in the office require sedation or anesthesia. They are all performed with simple local anesthesia.
