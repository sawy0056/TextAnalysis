A/S (CPH:FLS) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 10% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been less than pleasing. After all, the share price is down 12% in the last three years, significantly under-performing the market. View our latest analysis for FLSmidth In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, FLSmidth actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 27% per year. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's strange to see such muted share price performance despite sustained growth. Perhaps a clue lies in other metrics. So we'll have to take a look at other metrics to try to understand the price action.The company has kept revenue pretty healthy over the last three years, so we doubt that explains the falling share price. There doesn't seem to be any clear correlation between the fundamental business metrics and the share price. That could mean that the stock was previously overrated, or it could spell opportunity now.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).CPSE:FLS Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreFLSmidth is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, FLSmidth's TSR for the last 3 years was -5.7%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 31% in the last year, FLSmidth shareholders lost 4.2% (even including dividends) . However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 2.8% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at FLSmidth's dividend track record.
