The company is primed to become an integral player in making smart cities a reality across the globe as it goes well beyond micro-mobility with the reveal of a full spectrum of transportation innovations - from personal transporter pods, to rugged longer distance city transport devices and of course new kickscooter advancements - that rethink the transportation experience. On parallel tracks, they are also expanding their portfolio with new off-road and recreational vehicles including an ATV, UTV, SSV and an electric dirt bike. The new, beautifully designed lines were created with technology that not only makes them safe and easy to use, but also in the case of mobility lines to be used in urban setting, connectivity that will make them fit perfectly into a Smart City setting.Luke Gao, CEO of Segway-Ninebot said, “Segway-Ninebot has established itself as a category leader in short distance transportation solutions, from innovative delivery robots to kickscooters now used in cities across the world. We are changing the way people move from place to place. With an eye towards the future of how cities will evolve, as well as the mobility needs in the off-road space, we are notching up our offerings heading into 2020 so that they will fulfill the mobility needs and expectations of the world of tomorrow.”The biggest shift in urban transportation since the rise of Uber and Lyft is the ascension of the electric scooter. Segway-Ninebot has been a leader in the space, most recently highlighted by the fact that their Amazon Cyber Monday sales in 2019 increased by more than 1,171 percent as compared with the preceding year. The company has now taken those micro-mobility learnings to the next level, designing a complete portfolio of city and off-road transportation solutions to make commuting, leisure time and simply getting from point A to B more appealing. Their most anticipated launch is the Segway S-Pod, a personal transporter that will be introduced at Segway’s CES booth # 25602 at Las Vegas Convention Center on Tuesday, January 7th at 11am PT.The Segway S-Pod is a first-class smart transporting pod for enclosed campuses such as airports, theme parks and malls. It is a safe, self-balancing vehicle that is operated by an intuitive assistive navigation panel. With an adaptive center-of-gravity automatic control system, passengers can easily adjust the speed - up to 24 mph - by handling the knob to change the center of gravity in the pod. The S-Pod spins and rotates by the center smoothly for directional changes. The rider does not need to physically lean forward and back to accelerate or slow down. Also, since the “brake” is placed by the shift of the center of gravity, it eliminates the possibility of the S-Pod tipping over in any situation. The seating of the S-Pod offers wide angle views that provides an expansive viewing field of passengers. The S-Pod is also the first step in Segway working towards their goal of bringing new transportation options to cities. Segway S-Pod is equipped with remote control system through the detachable built-in pad. Another interesting tidbit—the Jurassic World Gyrosphere serves as the inspiration for this product.  Additional innovative lines that Segway-Ninebot will introduce at CES 2020 include:Beyond the Last Mile Transportation Solutions: The company will showcase two new vehicles that can travel longer distances in an urban setting:
