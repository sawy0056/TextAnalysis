ENXTPA:GUI Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Although it reported a loss over the past 12 months, Guillemot currently pays a dividend. When a company is loss-making, we next need to check to see if its cash flows can support the dividend.With a strong net cash balance, Guillemot investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Guillemot's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. With a payment history of less than 2 years, we think it's a bit too soon to think about living on the income from its dividend. Its most recent annual dividend was €0.13 per share.We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.Dividend Growth PotentialExamining whether the dividend is affordable and stable is important. However, it's also important to assess if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Over the long term, dividends need to grow at or above the rate of inflation, in order to maintain the recipient's purchasing power. It's good to see Guillemot has been growing its earnings per share at 35% a year over the past five years.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Guillemot's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Guillemot is paying out a dividend despite reporting a loss; clearly a concern. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the company has not been paying dividends as long as we'd like. While we're not hugely bearish on it, overall we think there are potentially better dividend stocks than Guillemot out there.See if management have their own wealth at stake, by checking insider shareholdings in Guillemot stock.We have also put together a list of global stocks with a market capitalisation above $1bn and yielding more 3%.
