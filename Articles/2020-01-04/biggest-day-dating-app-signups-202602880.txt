For those who are still single, the hunt is on.In fact, what’s supposedly the most popular dating day of the year is coming up this weekend. January 5, 2020, is being heralded as “Dating Sunday.”Executives at dating apps such as Match, Zoosk, and Bumble anticipate huge spikes in their app’s usage on the first Sunday of January every year. Some think the “Dating Sunday” phenomenon happens because there singles have only six weeks until Valentine’s Day, while others consider the New Year — and the whole idea of turning over a new leaf and starting the year fresh — as a factor.Zoosk’s CMO, Luciana Telles, said in a statement to CNET, “It’s the first weekend after New Year’s Eve, which means that people have not only set themselves New Year’s resolutions, they’ve had a few days to think about how to put them into practice.”If your New Year’s resolution is to find true love (however you might define the term), there are plenty of ways to meet people in the digital age. But in some cases you’ll need to first pay up to make those romantic connections.While many online dating sites and apps are free, some cost money to sign up, or offer paid premiums that allow for added bonuses and services. Is it worth paying extra for premium services on dating apps? Well, some think it may be worth it to get that extra boost to your profile, while others are more than happy getting their free swipes.Either way, here’s how much the biggest dating apps cost, and which dating apps are free:TinderFree or Tinder Plus for $9.99/month if you’re under 30, $19.99/month if you’re over 30Tinder helped popularized dating apps and started the swiping phenomenon.
