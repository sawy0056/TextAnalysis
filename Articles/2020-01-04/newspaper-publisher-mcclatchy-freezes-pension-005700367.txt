She declined to specify how many people would be affected by the freeze.The company is looking to address “long-term liquidity pressures” caused by its pension obligations due later this year. The company's employee pension plan is underfunded by more than a half-billion dollars, according to the Sacramento Business Journal.“This decision is not taken lightly, but at a time when the company is actively negotiating the future of the qualified pension plan, it would be inconsistent with our culture to continue payments on the non-qualified plans,” Lintecum said in a press release.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREGATEHOUSE, GANNETT RECEIVE APPROVAL TO MERGEMcClatchy, which publishes 30 newspapers including the Miami Herald, The Kansas City Star and The Sacramento Bee, is in the process of restructuring negotiations with lenders, bondholders and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation about its pension obligations, according to the press release.The company said benefits covered by its $1.3 billion qualified pension could continue to be distributed as normal.LOST JOURNALISM JOBS HIT RECORD HIGHMcClatchy is reportedly the second-largest newspaper chain in the country after GateHouse and Gannett received approval to merge last fall.
