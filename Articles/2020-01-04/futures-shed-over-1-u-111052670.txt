Baird in Milwaukee. "That's on top of the sentiment that the market has been overbought."S&P 500 bank stocks <.SPXBK> dropped 1.6% as the news sent benchmark U.S. bond yields <US10YT=RR> to their lowest since Dec. 12.Shares of airlines also tumbled as oil prices jumped about 3%.

Northrop Grumman Corp <NOC.N> shares climbed 5.4% and Lockheed Martin Corp <LMT.N> shares rose 3.6%. The two provided the biggest boosts to the S&P 500.The market disturbance following the strike could be fleeting, said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer of Vantagepoint Investment Advisers in Washington."We've looked at many types of conflicts over the last 20 years, and they've had much more of a short-term impact," Wicker said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 233.92 points, or 0.81%, to 28,634.88.
