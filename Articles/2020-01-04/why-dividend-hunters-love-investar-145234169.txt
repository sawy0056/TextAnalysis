If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.With a 1.0% yield and a five-year payment history, investors probably think Investar Holding looks like a reliable dividend stock. A low yield is generally a turn-off, but if the prospects for earnings growth were strong, investors might be pleasantly surprised by the long-term results. The company also bought back stock during the year, equivalent to approximately 4.1% of the company's market capitalisation at the time. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.

If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 13% of Investar Holding's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. We like this low payout ratio, because it implies the dividend is well covered and leaves ample opportunity for reinvestment.We update our data on Investar Holding every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Investar Holding has been paying a dividend for the past five years. During the past five-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.027 in 2015, compared to US$0.24 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 55% per year over this time.We're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Investar Holding has grown its earnings per share at 15% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share are growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low. We think this is an ideal combination in a dividend stock.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. We're glad to see Investar Holding has a low payout ratio, as this suggests earnings are being reinvested in the business. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the company has not been paying dividends as long as we'd like. Investar Holding has a number of positive attributes, but falls short of our ideal dividend company. It may be worth a look at the right price, though.Story continuesCompanies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
