See our latest analysis for Zhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings

All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Zhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that Zhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings has a lower P/E than the average (15.8) P/E for companies in the personal products industry.SEHK:3737 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreZhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with Zhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.It's great to see that Zhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings grew EPS by 22% in the last year. And it has improved its earnings per share by 22% per year over the last three years. So one might expect an above average P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does Zhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings's Balance Sheet Tell Us?With net cash of CN¥303m, Zhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 32% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On Zhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings's P/E RatioZhongzhi Pharmaceutical Holdings has a P/E of 9.8. That's below the average in the HK market, which is 10.7. Not only should the net cash position reduce risk, but the recent growth has been impressive. The below average P/E ratio suggests that market participants don't believe the strong growth will continue.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
