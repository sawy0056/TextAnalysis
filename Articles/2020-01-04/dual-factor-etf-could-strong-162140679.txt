The ETF's benchmark employs a quality screen to provide exposure to high-quality companies with lower absolute risk, thereby limiting potential future volatility. The quality screen analyzes a broad universe of equities based on key indicators such as profitability, management efficiency, and cash flow, and then excludes the bottom 20% of stocks with the lowest quality score. The index is then subject to regional, sector and risk-factor constraints, in order to manage unintended style factor exposures, significant sector concentration, and high turnover.“The performance leadership is similar to the last decade with the Low Volatility and Quality factors exhibiting the highest returns, albeit less extreme in magnitude than in previous years,” according to Factor Research. “Value continued to generate negative returns and the performance accumulates to what can be considered a lost decade for investors focused on buying cheap and selling expensive stocks.”Asking A QLV Query“Our research suggests that low volatility strategies have historically often resulted in portfolios with significant sector biases (e.g. utilities, consumer staples, etc.) that may result in unintended sector risks and potential interest rate sensitivity that investors may not have been expecting,” according to FlexShares.Quality should not be conflated with low volatility, but there are times when quality stocks display low volatility traits. That was the case during the fourth quarter of last year's market swoon, indicating that the quality factor can provide some protection during times of elevated market stress.It's also worth noting links between low volatility and value aren't as intimate as some investors may be led to believe.“There is no structural relationship between these two factors from a historical perspective, but in 2019 these behaved liked polar opposites, which was especially apparent from May onward, where Low Volatility generated strongly positive and Value significantly negative returns,” notes Factor Research.Related: This New Equity ETF Looks Like a Winner QLV may present investors with a surprising opportunity: the ability to capture some momentum.“Specifically, we observe that Momentum was highly correlated to the Low Volatility and Quality factors while being negatively correlated to Value,” notes Factor Research.For more on multi-asset strategies, please visit our Multi-Asset Channel.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Are Chipmakers’ Massive Gains Becoming Too Frothy?BKLN: Modest Yield, High RiskFedEx Barks Back At Amazon Over Shipping LimitationsBed Bath & Beyond Does Some Holiday CleaningGold Likely to Shine Brighter in 2020, Says World Gold CouncilREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextInvestors in Asia Still Betting Markets Will End Higher in 2020BloombergHow investors are using ‘alternative’ data to track China’s recovery from coronaviruMarketWatchDirect Relief Commits Initial $2 Million for U.S. Coronavirus ResponsePR NewswireWorld stocks set for worst week since 2008 as virus fears grip marketsReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
