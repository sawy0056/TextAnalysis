ESPN’s Monday Night Football saw the greatest gain, up 8% over last year, while Fox’s games were up 7%, and CBS and NBC games rose 4%.It is the second season in a row that NFL ratings have gone up 5% overall, after two seasons in a row of declines amid the player protests started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. NFL games this season made up all top 10 of the most-watched live TV broadcasts from September through December, 28 of the top 30, and 47 of the top 50.The ratings growth will help the NFL in the renegotiations of its TV contracts with CBS, NBC, Fox, and ESPN, which all expire in 2022.But the league hasn’t gotten back to 2015 levels, when the average viewership was 18.7 million. That further cements the popular consensus that NFL ratings peaked in 2015, and are unlikely to return to that level amid widespread cord-cutting.Even if that is the case, it is a secular trend affecting all live television and all the major sports leagues, and the NFL looks like it is weathering it the best. The league’s digital viewership (through the NFL’s own streaming options, Verizon, Amazon Prime, or digital options from the broadcasters themselves) rose 51% over last year.Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills, left, tries to stop Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Gallup (13) during the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Dec. 22, 2019, in Philadelphia.

It certainly has important problems that won’t go away (head injuries), but in 2019 it avoided major scandal, apart from a botched Colin Kaepernick tryout that many saw as a P.R. stunt by the league.The top five most-watched games this season included three Dallas Cowboys games and two New England Patriots games: Buffalo at Dallas on CBS in Week 13 (32.6 million viewers); Dallas at New England on Fox in Week 12 (29.9 million); Kansas City at New England on CBS in Week 14 (28.3 million); Chicago at Detroit on Fox in Week 13 (27.1 million); and Dallas at Philadelphia on Fox in Week 16 (25.7 million).The NFL Playoffs begin on Saturday, all leading up to Super Bowl 54 in Miami on Feb. 2.—Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance and closely covers sports business.
