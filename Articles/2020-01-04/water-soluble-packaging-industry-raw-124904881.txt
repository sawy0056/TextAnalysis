(India), Mondi Group (Austria), Sekisui Chemicals (Japan), Kuraray Co. Ltd. (Japan), Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings (Japan), Aicello Corporation (Japan), Aquapak Polymer Ltd (UK), Lactips (France), Cortec Corporation (US), Acedag Ltd. (UK), MSD Corporation (China), Prodotti Solutions (US), and JRF Technology LLC (US).By raw material, the polymer segment is accounted for the largest share in 2018.The polymer segment accounted for a major share in the global water soluble market, on the basis of raw material, in 2018. Polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol are majorly used as the water soluble material for manufacturing of packaging. Due to varied application of such polymers, along with higher availability of sources such as petrochemicals and plants (starch), the segment has accounted to have a significant share in the water soluble packaging market.By end use, the industrial segment in the water soluble packaging market is estimated to account for the largest share.Based on end use, the water soluble packaging market is segmented into industrial, residential, and others. The industrial sector is estimated to account for the largest share for water soluble packaging, because most of the industrial manufacturing companies are focusing toward reduction of waste generation from their manufacturing units and showing interest in making their processes more sustainable by replacing the usage of plastics. Also, in industries such as agriculture and detergents where chemical handling is the critical process, use of water soluble packaging makes it harmless for the workers to deal with chemicals. Thus, the demand for water soluble packaging is higher in industrial sectors.North America accounted for the largest share in the water soluble packaging market, due to the higher acceptability and growing awareness toward sustainability issues.The water soluble packaging market in the North American region is largely driven by growing consumer awareness toward environmental sustainability. Packaging waste is one of the significant issues faced in developing and developed countries. Moreover, the involvement of government with proposed legislation in California for a 75% reduction in plastic waste by 2030 also encourages the manufacturers to shift their interest toward water soluble packaging. Strong investment in R&D and technological advancements (such as barrier protection and better tensile strength) are expected to have a positive impact on the domestic production of water soluble packaging in North America.Key Topics Covered1.
