But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers So we wouldn't blame long term Chevalier International Holdings Limited (HKG:25) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 12% over a half decade. The silver lining is that the stock is up 1.0% in about a week. Check out our latest analysis for Chevalier International Holdings While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.While the share price declined over five years, Chevalier International Holdings actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 10.0% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.It is unusual to see such modest share price growth in the face of sustained EPS improvements. We can look to other metrics to try to understand the situation better.The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).SEHK:25 Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Chevalier International Holdings's TSR for the last 5 years was 25%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveChevalier International Holdings shareholders are up 12% for the year (even including dividends) . But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 4.5% over half a decade It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals.
