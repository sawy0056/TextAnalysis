Amazon.com (AMZN)
and
Facebook (FB) , among others. ARKW allocates almost 5% of its combined weight to Netflix
(NFLX)
and Amazon and its largest is
Tesla (TSLA)
at 10.42%.Still, ARKW is sufficiently levered to themes RBC Capital internet analyst Mark Mahaney recently highlighted that could benefit some of the fund's holdings.“Netflix subscribership accelerates in 2020: Mahaney sees this more as a possibility than a probability. It certainly would run counter to the conventional wisdom,”. He noted that in the U.S., comparisons will be relative to a year in which Netflix increased its prices materially, and reduced marketing spending. The company also is likely to benefit in 2020 from a further crumbling of cable and satellite subscriptions, Mahaney said.ARKW AnglesThe analyst also sees some of 2019's crop of unicorn initial public offerings, such as ARKW holding Pinterest
(PINS) , finding profitability in 2019. Conversely, Amazon could see margin compression as it seeks new growth frontiers that could benefit the company over the long haul.“Amazon’s profitability plummets. Mahaney says the company could aggressively invest in one-day delivery, physical stores, and the sales force at its Amazon Web Services business, potentially leading to a near-term decline in operating margins,” according to Barron's. Zillow (NYSE: Z) , ARKW's seventh-largest holding at a weight of 3.40%, is another of the fund's components that could rally in 2020 as the “iBuyer” real estate space grows and perhaps becoming profitable.“This is the newly emerging niche of buying and flipping homes. Mahaney notes that the business has been growing rapidly but unprofitably so far. He says that as a result of economies of scale in buying, selling, holding, and improving homes, there could be a shift that would allow the businesses to become modestly profitable,” reports Barron's.For more on disruptive technologies, visit our Disruptive Technology Channel.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Are Chipmakers’ Massive Gains Becoming Too Frothy?BKLN: Modest Yield, High RiskFedEx Barks Back At Amazon Over Shipping LimitationsBed Bath & Beyond Does Some Holiday CleaningGold Likely to Shine Brighter in 2020, Says World Gold CouncilREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAmazon exec says recent head-tax stance isn't a reversal from 2018 positionAmerican City Business JournalsAmazon Sets Horror-Comedy Series From ‘A Quiet Place’ and ‘Psych’ TeamsIndiewire'Love is Blind': All your post-finale burning questions for Jessica and Mark, answeredUSA TODAY Entertainment12 Cheap (but Expensive-Looking!)
