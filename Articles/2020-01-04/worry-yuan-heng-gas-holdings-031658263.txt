I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Yuan Heng Gas Holdings shrunk earnings per share by 63% over the last year. And EPS is down 20% a year, over the last 5 years. This growth rate might warrant a below average P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Yuan Heng Gas Holdings's Balance SheetYuan Heng Gas Holdings has net debt equal to 49% of its market cap.
