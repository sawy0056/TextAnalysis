Having Dave on-board super charges the possibilities and ways in which we can add value to the financial advisor community.”“Dave helps us deliver to our audience a greater degree of authority and expertise across the board, thereby delivering more value to our core audience,” noted Tom Hendrickson, ETF Flows Co-Founder.Dave Nadig Joins ETF Trends, ETF DatabaseMoreDave Nadig on stage at Inside ETFs 2019 in Hollywood, FloridaNadig comes with 25 years of ETF experience, most recently as Managing Director of ETF.com, where he helped grow the business and provide expert commentary for the past decade. Before that, he managed mutual funds at startup MetaMarkets.com, and was a Managing Director at Barclays Global Investors in the 1990s. He’s widely leveraged by media and institutions as a key expert in the field.   “ETFs have been a transformative technology for all classes of investors,” said Nadig. “But the pace of change isn’t slowing down. The efficiency of ETFs has been a catalyst for changes throughout the ecosystem, from free trading to the rise of robo-advisors. I’m looking forward to helping grow something equally transformative at ETF Trends and ETF Database.” ETF Trends and ETF Database merged
in February 2019 under newly-created ETF Flows LLC, which serves as a holding company for the ETFTrends.com and ETFdb.com brands.“We focus on delighting our core audience, the financial advisor, and look to provide them what they want, when they want it and how they want it,” added Hendrickson. “In our recent, soon-to-be-released study of financial advisor buying and research preferences, which included nearly 700 respondents, advisors voted clearly that the transition to digital consumption in a multitude of forms, including webcasts, virtual summits, video and interactive tools, is preferred. Advisors told us these types of digital offerings, from trusted third parties, were the go-to means of determining which products to purchase and utilize within their business.”ETF Database and ETF Trends serve advisors representing $3.5 trillion in assets under management [monthly]. Over 100,000 financial advisors register for their webcasts and virtual investment conferences annually.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Are Chipmakers’ Massive Gains Becoming Too Frothy?BKLN: Modest Yield, High RiskFedEx Barks Back At Amazon Over Shipping LimitationsBed Bath & Beyond Does Some Holiday CleaningGold Likely to Shine Brighter in 2020, Says World Gold CouncilREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSEC orders Wells Fargo pay $35 million for recommendations of high-risk productsReutersRetiree warning: History suggests we’re overdue for a bear marketMarketWatchCoronavirus fears are clobbering the stock market — is it doing the same to your retirement?MarketWatchStocks fell for a third day Wednesday on coronavirus fears — 5 questions to ask your financial adviser right nowMarketWatchJeffrey Epstein had 'no meaningful involvement' with Wexner Foundation, review findsAmerican City Business JournalsRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
