This suggests a high likelihood of closing the gap in the very near future.Should we see such price action, the way for the prices to trend south will be open. The bears can then follow up with a test of the lower border of the purple consolidation and the next green gap, which is where our initial downside target currently is.Summing up, crude oil ended 2019 with a bearish reversal, with the downswing supported by the extended position of the daily indicators. Regardless of today’s bullish gap, the sellers maintain control over today’s trading action, suggesting that the gap will likely be closed shortly. Our short position continues being justified from the risk-reward perspective.We hope you enjoyed reading the above free analysis, and we encourage you to read today’s Oil Trading Alert – this analysis’ full version.
