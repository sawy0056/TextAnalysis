(US), Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany), Hardy Process Solutions (US), Loma Systems (UK), Precia Molen (France), and Cardinal Scale (US).Automatic checkweigher market is expected to exhibit significant growth from 2019 to 2024The growing packaging industry, rising demand for packaged food, increasing consumer awareness regarding labeling and packaging of food products, and surging demand for high-speed and high-quality automatic weighing solutions are the major factors that are likely to accelerate the growth of the automatic checkweigher market.Strain gauge technology-based automatic checkweighers to account for largest market share during 2019-2024A strain gauge is the most commonly used load cell technology in automatic checkweighers. The strain gauge converts the load into electrical signals. The accuracy, proficiency, and extended service life of strain gauge technology-based automatic checkweighers has been field-proven. Moreover, improved customer satisfaction in the overall system performance has added a measurable benefit, and it also helps manufacturers to remain more competitive. Small size and simple design are the key factors driving the growth of the market for strain gauge technology-based checkweighers.Pharmaceuticals industry is expected to register the highest CAGR in global automatic checkweigher market from 2019 to 2024The automatic checkweigher market for the pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The use of automatic checkweighers is vital in pharmaceutical manufacturing as there is a high demand for accurate product weighing to attain quality control guidelines and avoid costly fines. Further, automatic checkweighers are designed to offer immediate and exact readings in numeric or easy-to-interpret graphical formats.Moreover, to meet hygiene standards in the pharmaceutical industry, automatic checkweighers are fabricated of stainless steel and designed to endure wash-down conditions. In addition, it improves the safety of pharmaceutical products by offering high weighing accuracy, reliability, and performance. All these factors are likely to fuel the growth of the automatic checkweigher market for the pharmaceuticals industry market in the coming years.APAC would dominate automatic checkweigher market during the forecast periodAPAC is likely to continue to dominate the automatic checkweigher market during the forecast period owing to the expanding pharmaceutical market and tightening regulations to enhance the quality and reliability of locally packaged products in APAC countries. In addition, the implementation of automated solutions has enabled companies in this region to achieve increased productivity, with lower capital investments in packaging.Story continuesSimilarly, rapid urbanization, coupled with increasing disposable income in emerging countries such as China, India, and South Korea, has boosted the growth of the pharmaceuticals and food & beverage industries in this region, thereby leading to the rising demand for automatic checkweighers in the region.
