In response, the price of Bloom Energy shares fell sharply that day.If you invested in Bloom Energy Corporation between July 22, 2018 and Sept. 16, 2019 (the “Class Period”) and suffered significant losses, you may qualify to be a lead plaintiff – one who selects and oversees the attorneys prosecuting the case.
