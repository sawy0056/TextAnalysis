(NASDAQ: TSLA) reported record deliveries of approximately 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019. Street analysts expected the company to deliver 106,000 vehicles in the quarter.For the entire year, Tesla delivered approximately 367,500 vehicles, 50% more than the previous year and in line with full-year guidance."Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct," the company said in a press release.Tesla is also now shipping its vehicles to more locations, including in the U.K. and China."We continue to focus on expanding production in both the U.S. as well as our newly launched facility in Shanghai," the company said. "Despite breaking ground at Gigafactory Shanghai less than 12 months ago, we have already produced just under 1,000 customer salable cars and have begun deliveries."Tesla's stock traded up 1.8% at $438 per share in Friday’s pre-market session. The stock has a 52-week high of $435.31 and a 52-week low of $176.99.Related Links:Canaccord Lifts Tesla Price Target Above 0 Amid International OpportunityWhy Tesla's Cracked Cybertruck Window May Have Been A Shrewd Marketing Move0See more from BenzingaTesla Reportedly Borrowing .4B From Chinese Banks For Shanghai FactoryWhy Tesla's Cracked Cybertruck Window May Have Been A Shrewd Marketing Move© 2020 Benzinga.com.
