We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Kingfisher plc's (LON:KGF), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is Kingfisher's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 25.49. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 3.9%. View our latest analysis for Kingfisher How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Kingfisher:P/E of 25.49 = £2.21 ÷ £0.09 (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each £1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Kingfisher's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (15.9) for companies in the specialty retail industry is lower than Kingfisher's P/E.LSE:KGF Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreKingfisher's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.Kingfisher saw earnings per share decrease by 53% last year. And EPS is down 18% a year, over the last 5 years. This growth rate might warrant a below average P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Kingfisher's Balance SheetKingfisher has net cash of UK£241m. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.The Verdict On Kingfisher's P/E RatioKingfisher has a P/E of 25.5. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 18.4. The recent drop in earnings per share might keep value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
