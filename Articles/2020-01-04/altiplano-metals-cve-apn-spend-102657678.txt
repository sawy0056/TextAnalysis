For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.So, the natural question for Altiplano Metals (CVE:APN) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. In this article, we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow, which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. Check out our latest analysis for Altiplano Metals How Long Is Altiplano Metals's Cash Runway?A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. In September 2019, Altiplano Metals had CA$50k in cash, and was debt-free. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through CA$2.9m. So it seems to us it had a cash runway of less than two months from September 2019. It's extremely surprising to us that the company has allowed its cash runway to get that short! Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.TSXV:APN Historical Debt, January 3rd 2020MoreHow Is Altiplano Metals's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Because Altiplano Metals isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. As it happens, the company's cash burn reduced by 30% over the last year, which suggests that management are mindful of the possibility of running out of cash. Admittedly, we're a bit cautious of Altiplano Metals due to its lack of significant operating revenues. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.Can Altiplano Metals Raise More Cash Easily?While Altiplano Metals is showing a solid reduction in its cash burn, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.Since it has a market capitalisation of CA$4.4m, Altiplano Metals's CA$2.9m in cash burn equates to about 66% of its market value. Given how large that cash burn is, relative to the market value of the entire company, we'd consider it to be a high risk stock, with the real possibility of extreme dilution.Is Altiplano Metals's Cash Burn A Worry?As you can probably tell by now, we're rather concerned about Altiplano Metals's cash burn. Take, for example, its cash runway, which suggests the company may have difficulty funding itself, in the future. While not as bad as its cash runway, its cash burn reduction is also a concern, and considering everything mentioned above, we're struggling to find much to be optimistic about. The measures we've considered in this article lead us to believe its cash burn is actually quite concerning, and its weak cash position seems likely to cost shareholders one way or another.
