This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally we will reflect on how common stockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. View our latest analysis for NZME How Does Michael Boggs's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, NZME Limited has a market capitalization of NZ$81m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth NZ$1.3m over the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at NZ$856k. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations under NZ$297m, and the median CEO total compensation was NZ$398k.As you can see, Michael Boggs is paid more than the median CEO pay at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this does not necessarily mean NZME Limited is paying too much. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into the underlying business performance.You can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at NZME, below.NZSE:NZM CEO Compensation, January 3rd 2020MoreIs NZME Limited Growing?On average over the last three years, NZME Limited has grown earnings per share (EPS) by 103% each year (using a line of best fit).
