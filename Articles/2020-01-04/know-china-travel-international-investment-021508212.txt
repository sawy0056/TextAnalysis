When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.China Travel International Investment Hong Kong saw earnings per share decrease by 37% last year. But over the longer term (3 years), earnings per share have increased by 10%. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 13% per year over the last five years.

Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does China Travel International Investment Hong Kong's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?With net cash of HK$3.7b, China Travel International Investment Hong Kong has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business.
