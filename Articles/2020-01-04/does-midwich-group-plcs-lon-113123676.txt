We'll look at Midwich Group Plc's (LON:MIDW) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Midwich Group has a P/E ratio of 28.71, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 3.5%. View our latest analysis for Midwich Group How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Midwich Group:P/E of 28.71 = £5.25 ÷ £0.18 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each £1 of company earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Midwich Group's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. As you can see below, Midwich Group has a higher P/E than the average company (21.5) in the electronic industry.AIM:MIDW Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Midwich Group shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.Midwich Group saw earnings per share decrease by 14% last year. And EPS is down 33% a year, over the last 5 years. This could justify a pessimistic P/E.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).How Does Midwich Group's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Midwich Group has net debt worth 17% of its market capitalization. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Verdict On Midwich Group's P/E RatioMidwich Group trades on a P/E ratio of 28.7, which is above its market average of 18.4.
