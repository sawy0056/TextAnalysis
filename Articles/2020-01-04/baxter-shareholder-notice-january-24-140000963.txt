The Company also admitted that these intra-Company transactions had "resulted in certain misstatements in the Company's previously reported non-operating income related to net foreign exchange gains" and acknowledged that upon completion of its investigation, "the Company expects to either amend its periodic reports previously filed with the SEC to include restated financial statements that correct those misstatements, or include in reports for future periods restated comparative financial statements that correct those misstatements." Following this news, the price of Baxter common stock fell $8.87 per share, or 10.1%, from a close of $87.95 per share on October 23, 2019 to close at $79.08 per share on October 24, 2019, on elevated trading volume.About Lieff CabraserLieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, with offices in San Francisco, New York, and Nashville, is a nationally recognized law firm committed to advancing the rights of investors and promoting corporate responsibility.Story continuesThe National Law Journal has recognized Lieff Cabraser as one of the nation's top plaintiffs' law firms for fourteen years.
