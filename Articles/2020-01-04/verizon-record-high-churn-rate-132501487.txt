VZ announced that it has decided to part ways with broadcasting company — Cox Media Group — due to an ongoing contract conflict.

This step is likely to deal a massive blow to Verizon Fios customers.Verizon alleged that Cox Media Group is currently seeking to hike prices by a hefty 70%. However, Cox Media Group claimed that it had tried to negotiate at rates way below existing market price, which has further complicated the situation. As a result, customers, who are primarily based in key markets like Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Boston, will be losing out on four TV channels, namely WPXI-Pittsburgh, WSYT and WNYS in Syracuse, and WFXT-Boston 25 News.Per media reports, the broadcasting and digital media conglomerate has tried to mend differences with Verizon at multiple points for uninterrupted services to customers.
