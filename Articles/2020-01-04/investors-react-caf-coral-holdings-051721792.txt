This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. After that, we will consider the growth in the business. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels. View our latest analysis for Café de Coral Holdings How Does Peter Lo's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?At the time of writing, our data says that Café de Coral Holdings Limited has a market cap of HK$11b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of HK$12m for the year to March 2019. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at HK$4.3m. We further remind readers that the CEO may face performance requirements to receive the non-salary part of the total compensation. We examined companies with market caps from HK$7.8b to HK$25b, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was HK$4.1m.It would therefore appear that Café de Coral Holdings Limited pays Peter Lo more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high.
