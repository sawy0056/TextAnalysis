This should help sustain same-store sales growth at industry-leading levels in 2020 and beyond.In fact, Setyan thinks delivery alone could contribute more than 6% of incremental same-store sales in 2020 if management continues to focus on effective marketing programs. A Wedbush survey on all things delivery related found Wingstop's usage and awareness has room to improve versus its peers which implies a potential for sustained delivery growth.The company's favorable positioning is also backed by three specific initiatives, including adding new delivery partners, growth in marketing spend and potential for increased throughput opportunities which were implemented in the U.K. market and now being tested in the domestic market.Price ActionShares of Wingstop traded higher by 3.3% to $87.58 at time of publication.Related Links:Analyst: Food Delivery Companies Have Room For Growth, But Face Cash-Burning CompetitionWedbush Downgrades Wingstop, Valuation Reflects Growth MomentumLatest Ratings for WING Date Firm Action From To
