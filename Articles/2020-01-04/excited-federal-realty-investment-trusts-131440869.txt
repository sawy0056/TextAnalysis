With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), by way of a worked example.Our data shows Federal Realty Investment Trust has a return on equity of 9.9% for the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn $0.10. Check out our latest analysis for Federal Realty Investment Trust How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Federal Realty Investment Trust:9.9% = US$268m ÷ US$2.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does ROE Mean?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does Federal Realty Investment Trust Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Federal Realty Investment Trust has a higher ROE than the average (5.9%) in the REITs industry.NYSE:FRT Past Revenue and Net Income, January 3rd 2020MoreThat is a good sign. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining Federal Realty Investment Trust's Debt And Its 9.9% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the significant use of debt by Federal Realty Investment Trust, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.22. while its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit to how much debt a company can use. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.In SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
