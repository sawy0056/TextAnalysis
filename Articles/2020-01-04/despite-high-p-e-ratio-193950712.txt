As you can see below, Mueller Water Products has a higher P/E than the average company (22.9) in the machinery industry.NYSE:MWA Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreMueller Water Products's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Mueller Water Products saw earnings per share decrease by 39% last year. But EPS is up 3.0% over the last 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Is Debt Impacting Mueller Water Products's P/E?Mueller Water Products has net debt worth 14% of its market capitalization. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.The Bottom Line On Mueller Water Products's P/E RatioMueller Water Products's P/E is 29.7 which is above average (18.9) in its market. With a bit of debt, but a lack of recent growth, it's safe to say the market is expecting improved profit performance from the company, in the next few years.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
