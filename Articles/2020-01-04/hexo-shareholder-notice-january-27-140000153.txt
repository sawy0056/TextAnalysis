Lee of Lieff Cabraser toll-free at 1-800-541-7358.HEXO, incorporated and headquartered in Canada, makes and sells cannabis products for distribution to users, principally through third-party physical and online retailers.Based on our investigation, we believe HEXO made materially false or misleading statements by (1) providing revenue guidance that materially overstated HEXO's likely revenue for 2020, (2) overstating the number of retail locations for HEXO's product that would be available during the fiscal year of 2019, (3) overstating the value of inventory, and (4) failing to disclose the Company's unlicensed growth of cannabis in Niagara.After the close of markets on October 4, 2019, HEXO announced the sudden resignation of its new Chief Financial Officer. In response, HEXO's stock price declined 6% to close at $3.80 on October 7, 2019, the next trading day.Six days later on October 10, 2019, HEXO withdrew its revenue guidance for the fiscal year of 2020 based in part on slow expansion of retail locations in Quebec and Ontario. That day, HEXO's stock price closed at $3.66, or 22% lower than the prior day's closing price.On October 28, 2019 HEXO announced that it would take an impairment charge as a result of an excess of inventory that was caused in part by the slow expansion of retail locations in Quebec and Ontario. HEXO's stock declined another 6% to close at $2.52 the next day.Then on November 15, 2019, HEXO belatedly disclosed that it had identified the unlicensed growth of cannabis on a HEXO property on July 30, 2019. That day, HEXO's stock closed at $1.79, a 5% decline from the prior day's closing price.About Lieff CabraserLieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, with offices in San Francisco, New York, and Nashville, is a nationally recognized law firm committed to advancing the rights of investors and promoting corporate responsibility.The National Law Journal has recognized Lieff Cabraser as one of the nation's top plaintiffs' law firms for fourteen years.
