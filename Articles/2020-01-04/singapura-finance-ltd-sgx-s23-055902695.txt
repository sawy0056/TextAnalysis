Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.With Singapura Finance yielding 4.5% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Singapura Finance for its dividend - read on to learn more. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Singapura Finance! SGX:S23 Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Singapura Finance paid out 36% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Singapura Finance's latest financial position,

Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Singapura Finance's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was S$0.06 in 2010, compared to S$0.04 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 4.0% a year during that period. Singapura Finance's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 4.0% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.We struggle to make a case for buying Singapura Finance for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past ten years.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Singapura Finance's EPS are effectively flat over the past five years. Flat earnings per share are acceptable for a time, but over the long term, the purchasing power of the company's dividends could be eroded by inflation.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Singapura Finance's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Firstly, we like that Singapura Finance has a low and conservative payout ratio. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and its dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Singapura Finance might not be a bad business, but it doesn't show all of the characteristics we look for in a dividend stock.Story continuesAre management backing themselves to deliver performance?
