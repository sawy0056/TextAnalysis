The SEC said at the time that Crypto Asset Management and its principal, Timothy Enneking, raised over $3.6 million in late 2017 and claimed that the firm was “the first regulated crypto asset fund” in the U.S.Enneking and the firm at the time neither admitted nor denied the SEC's findings and had agreed to a cease-and-desist order and a penalty of $200,000.The lawsuit now alleges that Faegre Baker advised Crypto Asset Management and Enneking that “Crypto Assets are not securities” and to thus structure the fund’s business “accordingly.” The advice was “erroneous,” the lawsuit states.The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, including for fees and costs incurred, reputational harm, lost profits and other consequential damages, per the lawsuit.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
