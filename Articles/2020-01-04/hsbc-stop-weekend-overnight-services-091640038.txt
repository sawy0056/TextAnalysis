As a precautionary measure they will be closed from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, the days before public holidays and on public holidays until further notice, the bank said in a statement.HSBC on Thursday closed two branches and seven indoor ATM clusters after they were vandalized during anti-government protests on New Year's Day and Christmas Eve.The famous pair of lions that guard its city center headquarters were daubed with graffiti and briefly set alight after being doused in a flammable liquid.(Reporting by Alun John; Editing by Alex Richardson)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, two others arrested on illegal assembly charges - mediaReutersUS, European stocks plunge, extending rout amid virus fearsAFPNew virus prompts Mormons to cancel key leadership eventAssociated PressPittsburgh companies implement travel restrictions in response to coronavirus threatsAmerican City Business JournalsCanada issues travel health notice for seven countries amid COVID-19 outbreakYahoo News CanadaRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
