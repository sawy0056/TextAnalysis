Implements Technical Database, Continues Compilation and Targeting Work on Cassiar Gold Property and Retains Market MakerNewsfile Corp.NewsfileJanuary 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShare1MM oz gold Inferred Resource at 0.7 g/t Au cut-off for past-producing Taurus PropertyCalgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - January 3, 2020) - Margaux Resources Ltd. (TSXV: MRL) (OTCQB: MARFF) ("Margaux" or the "Company") recently filed a National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report to support its maiden mineral resource estimate for the Taurus Deposit on the Cassiar Gold property (the "Cassiar Property") in British Columbia, Canada (see Margaux press release November 13, 2019). Details of the 1 MM oz gold inferred resource at 1.43 g/t Au (0.7 g/t Au cut-off) were announced in the Company's news release dated September 11, 2019.The Margaux technical team continues to compile and verify historical technical data in preparation for the upcoming exploration season. Implementation of a database system to house all technical data is underway. Existing digital data is being vetted and transferred, while additional data from historical work on the property is being incorporated. The Cassiar Project has an extensive exploration history, with data collected by many operators and explorers. Compilation and analysis of this data was a recommendation in the recent 43-101 technical report. The database will provide a robust foundation for geological model and target development and ranking at Taurus and across the entire Property.In addition to technical work, Margaux is advancing reporting, permitting, and logistical planning to support the 2020 exploration program, which will include drilling, and is expected to commence in May. The program will focus on quality infill, extension, and exploration targets, primarily near the 1 MM oz Taurus resource area. Margaux is committed to delivering results, with a cost-effective and efficient program."With a history of gold mining on high-grade vein deposits across the Property, and a recently-confirmed million-ounce bulk tonnage resource at surface, we see a lot of upside at Cassiar, and look forward to further exploring and developing the Cassiar Property in 2020, " stated Tyler Rice, President and CEO of Margaux.BackgroundThe Cassiar Property is a road-accessible, advanced-stage orogenic gold system located in northern British Columbia, Canada. In June 2019, Margaux Resources Ltd. announced that the shareholders of Wildsky Resources Inc. approved the sale of its 100% interest in the Cassiar Property by way of an all-share option agreement with Margaux (see Margaux news release dated June 24, 2019). Final approval of the transaction was granted by the TSX Venture Exchange ("TSXV") in November (see Margaux news release dated November 13, 2019).On the Cassiar Property, gold mineralization occurs along a 15 km corridor. Within this structural corridor, gold occurs both as discrete high-grade veins and as near-surface low-grade style mineralization. Past production from the Cassiar Property (primarily 1979-1997) is approximately 920,000 tonnes at an average grade of 11.9 grams per tonne (g/t) gold, or a total of 350,000 ounces of hard rock gold. During this period, portions of the Cassiar Property were held by different operators, and production was from different mine operations (predominantly underground) utilizing different mill facilities.The Cassiar Property has subsequently been amalgamated and now covers 56,000 hectares. It is bisected by Highway 37, with significant existing road access infrastructure and a 30 person camp with grid power.Margaux believes there to be good potential for new discoveries of low-grade bulk tonnage gold mineralization on its Cassiar Property. Numerous known high-grade gold showings on the Cassiar Property have been tested by only limited drilling, and the property-wide potential for low-grade bulk tonnage deposits has only been investigated at Taurus, to date.Retention of Market MakerThe Company is also pleased to announce that, subject to regulatory approval, it has retained Mackie Research Capital Corporation to initiate its market making service to provide market making services to the Company in compliance with the policies and guidelines of the TSXV and other applicable legislation.Mackie will trade shares of Margaux on the TSXV for the purposes of maintaining a reasonable market and improving the liquidity of Margaux's common shares.
