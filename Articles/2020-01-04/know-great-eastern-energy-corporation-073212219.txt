We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited's (LON:GEEC), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Based on the last twelve months, Great Eastern Energy's P/E ratio is 2.98. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying £2.98 for every £1 in prior year profit. Check out our latest analysis for Great Eastern Energy How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price (in reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Great Eastern Energy:P/E of 2.98 = £0.29 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, USD ) ÷ £0.10 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each £1 the company has earned over the last year. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does Great Eastern Energy Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. The image below shows that Great Eastern Energy has a lower P/E than the average (7.3) P/E for companies in the oil and gas industry.LSE:GEEC Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreGreat Eastern Energy's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with Great Eastern Energy, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.In the last year, Great Eastern Energy grew EPS like Taylor Swift grew her fan base back in 2010; the 186% gain was both fast and well deserved. Regrettably, the longer term performance is poor, with EPS down 7.1% per year over 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does Great Eastern Energy's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Great Eastern Energy's net debt is considerable, at 199% of its market cap. This level of debt justifies a relatively low P/E, so remain cognizant of the debt, if you're comparing it to other stocks.The Bottom Line On Great Eastern Energy's P/E RatioGreat Eastern Energy trades on a P/E ratio of 3.0, which is below the GB market average of 18.4. While the EPS growth last year was strong, the significant debt levels reduce the number of options available to management. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
