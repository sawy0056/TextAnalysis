But only the myopic could ignore the astounding decline over three years. To wit, the share price sky-dived 88% in that time. So it's about time shareholders saw some gains. Of course the real question is whether the business can sustain a turnaround.We really feel for shareholders in this scenario. It's a good reminder of the importance of diversification, and it's worth keeping in mind there's more to life than money, anyway. View our latest analysis for Jaywing Jaywing isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing.
