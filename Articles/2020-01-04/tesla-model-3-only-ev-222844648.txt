Other automakers investing billions to roll out electric models have serious catching up to do.After the Model 3, one has to scroll far down the sales rankings to find Tesla’s Model S and X and offerings from General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Co. And 2019 was a year to forget for the Chevrolet Bolt and Nissan Leaf, with deliveries dropping 8.9% and 16%, respectively.And what of those pricey European models that are supposed to challenge Elon Musk? Porsche is just starting to sell the much-hyped Taycan and handed over the first 130 units in December. Audi sold 746 of its all-electric e-tron crossovers and tallied just 5,369 units for the year. Jaguar was even further behind, delivering 2,594 I-Pace SUVs.To give Musk a more-serious run for his money, automakers are probably going to need models with longer range before plugging in and charging.
