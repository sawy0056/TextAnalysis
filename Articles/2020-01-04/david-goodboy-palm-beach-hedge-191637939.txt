Goodboy, has partnered with the Palm Beach Symphony, creating opportunities for members to experience one of South Florida’s major cultural institutions.The Palm Beach Symphony, which recently appointed legendary conductor Gerard Schwarz as its music director, is currently in its 46th season. The Symphony plans a new, diverse lineup of audience experiences this season at a broader range of venues.“Our organizations’ membership demographics suggest a tremendous synergy and we are pleased to introduce Palm Beach Symphony to the Palm Beach Hedge Fund Association’s membership base of more than 1,600 financial professionals and high-net worth investors,” said Palm Beach Symphony CEO David McClymont. He added, “Our 46th season has been nothing less than transformative, and we look forward to reaching out to new audiences with this exciting partnership.”“Palm Beach Symphony is raising the bar on bringing virtuoso artistic talent to the Palm Beach region, and creating tremendous new opportunities to experience world class arts and culture here in South Florida. I am excited to introduce our members to this cultural gem that is making an incredible impact,” said PBHFA Founder David S. Goodboy.The PBHFA hosts regular events from the fall through spring, not only in Palm Beach but also in regional cities such as Miami and even a recent forum in Monaco aimed at members who summer in Southern Europe. Last April, the Association hosted an event at the Four Seasons Palm Beach, where financial technology company SS&C Founder and CEO Bill Stone gave the keynote speech.More recently, the PBHFA partnered with Virgin Trains USA, an affiliate of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group.
