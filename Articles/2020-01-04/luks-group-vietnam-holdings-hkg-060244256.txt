But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Luks Group (Vietnam Holdings) Company Limited (HKG:366) shareholders, since the share price is down 42% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 28%. The silver lining is that the stock is up 1.3% in about a week. View our latest analysis for Luks Group (Vietnam Holdings) While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, Luks Group (Vietnam Holdings) actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 20% per year. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.It's worth taking a look at other metrics, because the EPS growth doesn't seem to match with the falling share price.Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market. It's good to see that Luks Group (Vietnam Holdings) has increased its revenue over the last three years. If the company can keep growing revenue, there may be an opportunity for investors. You might have to dig deeper to understand the recent share price weakness.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:366 Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreIf you are thinking of buying or selling Luks Group (Vietnam Holdings) stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Luks Group (Vietnam Holdings)'s TSR for the last 3 years was -32%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveLuks Group (Vietnam Holdings) shareholders are down 11% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 16%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.
