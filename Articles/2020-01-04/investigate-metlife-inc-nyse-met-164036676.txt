(NYSE:MET) At US$51.62?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosMetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine MetLife’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for MetLife What is MetLife worth?Good news, investors! MetLife is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $88.12, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, MetLife’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from MetLife?NYSE:MET Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for MetLife, at least in the near future.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? Although MET is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to MET, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MET for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
