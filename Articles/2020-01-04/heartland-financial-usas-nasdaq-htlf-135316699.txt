Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$105m. This suggests to me that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. For companies with market capitalizations between US$1.0b and US$3.2b, like Heartland Financial USA, the median CEO pay is around US$3.9m.The Heartland Financial USA CEO received total compensation of just US$1.5m in the year to December 2018. That looks like modest pay to me, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Story continuesShould You Add Heartland Financial USA To Your Watchlist?One positive for Heartland Financial USA is that it is growing EPS.
