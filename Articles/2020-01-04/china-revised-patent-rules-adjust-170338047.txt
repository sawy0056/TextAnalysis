Rather, it should consider the proposed technology, the challenges it seeks to address, and the expected technical outcomes as a package and make decisions accordingly. By the end of 2019, China has seen more than 12,300 blockchain-related patents submitted, records from global patent database incoPat show. In 2019 alone, there were over 4,295 patent applications pertaining to blockchain technology, with Tencent, Alibaba, and ReeChain constituting the top three applicants. The goal of the latest revision is to streamline the patent application process when it comes to new technologies and strengthen patent enforcement in this regard, experts told Chinese news outlet Mars Finance.  ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHouse committee to explore benefits of blockchain for small businesses next weekThe BlockDusk Network Plans to Tokenize Equity for Thousands of Dutch CompaniesCoindeskMillennials & Gen Z to Drive Gaming Industry: 5 Stocks to WatchZacksStellar Invests in Security Token Platform Targeting Developing MarketsCoindeskCan cryptocurrency become the UN money of the future?QuartzRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
