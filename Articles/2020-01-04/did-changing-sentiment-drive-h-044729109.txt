But long term H&R GmbH & Co. KGaA (ETR:2HRA) shareholders have had a particularly rough ride in the last three year. Regrettably, they have had to cope with a 63% drop in the share price over that period. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 11% in the last three months. View our latest analysis for H&R GmbH KGaA While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the three years that the share price fell, H&R GmbH KGaA's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 47% each year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 28% compound annual share price fall. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have previously priced some of the drop in.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).XTRA:2HRA Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between H&R GmbH KGaA's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for H&R GmbH KGaA shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 61%, over the last 3 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 25% in the last year, H&R GmbH KGaA shareholders lost 15%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 4.0% over the last half decade.
