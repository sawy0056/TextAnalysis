This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Ingenico Group - GCS (EPA:ING), by way of a worked example.Over the last twelve months Ingenico Group - GCS has recorded a ROE of 9.2%. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each €1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made €0.09 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Ingenico Group - GCS How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Ingenico Group - GCS:9.2% = €216m ÷ €2.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does ROE Mean?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does Ingenico Group - GCS Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry.

That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Ingenico Group - GCS's Debt And Its 9.2% ROEIt's worth noting the significant use of debt by Ingenico Group - GCS, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.11. Its ROE is quite good but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Story continuesHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock.
