Even longer term holders have taken a real hit with the stock declining 8.1% in the last year. On the bright side, the share price is slightly up over the last 90 days.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth.

While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Flanigan's Enterprises maintained roughly steady earnings over the last twelve months. But EPS is up 5.7% over the last 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does Flanigan's Enterprises's Balance Sheet Tell Us?The extra options and safety that comes with Flanigan's Enterprises's US$592k net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.The Verdict On Flanigan's Enterprises's P/E RatioFlanigan's Enterprises has a P/E of 11.6. That's below the average in the US market, which is 18.9. The recent drop in earnings per share would make investors cautious, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: if so, the low P/E could be an opportunity. Given Flanigan's Enterprises's P/E ratio has declined from 11.6 to 11.6 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is less confident about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
