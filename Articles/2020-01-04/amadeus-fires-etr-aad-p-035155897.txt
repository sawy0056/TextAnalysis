Looking back a bit further, we're also happy to report the stock is up 88% in the last year.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. Check out our latest analysis for Amadeus FiRe How Does Amadeus FiRe's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?Amadeus FiRe's P/E of 29.67 indicates some degree of optimism towards the stock. As you can see below, Amadeus FiRe has a higher P/E than the average company (21.2) in the professional services industry.XTRA:AAD Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 3rd 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Amadeus FiRe will outperform other companies in its industry. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.It's great to see that Amadeus FiRe grew EPS by 18% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 10%. With that performance, you might expect an above average P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.How Does Amadeus FiRe's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Amadeus FiRe has net cash of €60m. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.The Verdict On Amadeus FiRe's P/E RatioAmadeus FiRe has a P/E of 29.7. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 21.3. Its strong balance sheet gives the company plenty of resources for extra growth, and it has already proven it can grow. Therefore it seems reasonable that the market would have relatively high expectations of the company What is very clear is that the market has become significantly more optimistic about Amadeus FiRe over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 22.6 back then to 29.7 today. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it.
