Invesco S&P SmallCap Energy ETF (PSCE)
increased 2.7%.Meanwhile, the
United States Oil Fund (USO) , which tracks West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures, and the
United States Brent Oil Fund (BNO) , which tracks Brent crude oil futures, were also 3.0% and 0.5% 3.6, respectively, on Friday. WTI crude oil futures were up 2.9% to $63.0 per barrel and Brent crude rose 3.5% to $68.6 per barrel.Iran promised retaliatory action in response to the death of Major-General Qassem Soleimani, architect of Iran’s spreading military influence in the Middle East. Tehran's response could stall waterborne shipments from the Persian Gulf, including from Saudi Arabia, the Wall Street Journal reports. The pressure would affect roughly a third of the world’s shipped oil that goes through the Strait of Hormuz where tankers have been previously attacked and seized.“The rhetoric is one of severe retaliation from Iran, and I’m expecting the market to drift higher as tensions continue to rise,” Edward Marshall, a commodities trader at investment firm Global Risk Management, told the WSJ.Analysts warned that given the history of attacks on U.S.-backed allies, such as the one on Saudi Arabia’s facilities in September, Iran might respond to the U.S. airstrike by focusing on regional energy infrastructure.“In terms of what this means for Saudi Arabia, they’ll be extremely nervous today. They’d love to have Iran confronted but they won’t want to be on the front line,” Charles Hollis, a former U.K. diplomat to Saudi Arabia and Iran, and managing director of geopolitical risk consulting firm Falanx Assynt, told the WSJ.“[For Iran], to attack a proxy nation after a direct attack from the U.S. is an easy option, but I’m almost certain the U.S. will have reinforced defenses there,” Hollis added.For more information on the energy sector, visit our energy category.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Are Chipmakers’ Massive Gains Becoming Too Frothy?BKLN: Modest Yield, High RiskFedEx Barks Back At Amazon Over Shipping LimitationsBed Bath & Beyond Does Some Holiday CleaningGold Likely to Shine Brighter in 2020, Says World Gold CouncilREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; WHO Sees ‘Decisive’ Stage: Virus UpdateBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2014 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersAt least 7 Iranian government officials have coronavirusThe WeekWorld prepares for coronavirus pandemic; global recession forecastReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
