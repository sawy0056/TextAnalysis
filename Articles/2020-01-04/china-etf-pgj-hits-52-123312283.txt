The fund just hit a 52-week high — up roughly 43.9% from its 52-week low of $30.67/share.Does it have more gains in store? Let’s take a look at the fund and its near-term outlook to gain an insight into where it might be headed:PGJ in FocusThe underlying NASDAQ Golden Dragon China Index is currently comprised of 38 U.S. exchange-listed stocks of companies that derive a majority of their revenues from the Peoples Republic of China. The fund charges 70 bps in fees (see all Asia-Pacific (Emerging) ETFs here).Why the Move?The CSI 300 of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed companies touched their highest level since February 2018. This happened because China’s central bank injected about $115 billion into the country’s financial system by slashing the reserve requirement ratio for commercial lenders across the board by 50 basis points. Meanwhile, a survey indicated continued improvement in China’s manufacturing sector. All these positive news flows explain the latest high in the fund.More Gains Ahead?The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold). However, it has a positive weighted alpha of 37.20, which gives cues of further rally.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free>> Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
