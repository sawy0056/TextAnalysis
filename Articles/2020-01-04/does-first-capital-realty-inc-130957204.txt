We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We examined companies with market caps from CA$2.6b to CA$8.3b, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was CA$3.8m.So Adam Paul is paid around the average of the companies we looked at.
