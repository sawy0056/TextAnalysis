That compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a rise of 2,000.A recession in the manufacturing sector prompted by slower exports has weakened Germany's labour market, which has been the backbone of a consumption-led growth cycle. It has also resulted in weaker growth.Friday's data showed that the rise in unemployment was the highest since May. The jobless rate held steady at 5.0% - slightly above the record low of 4.9% reached earlier this year."The weak economic cycle is leaving visible marks (on the labour market)" said Labour Office head Detlef Scheele.Combined with subdued inflation and rising government spending, the labour market should help Germany escape a recession this year despite a small rise in unemployment. The government forecasts a growth rate of 1.0% in 2020.Separate data published on Friday showed that German inflation remained muted in December. EU-harmonised consumer prices rose by 1.5% year-on-year, which is bad news for the European Central Bank (ECB) but good news for German consumers.The Statistics Office said that on average prices rose by 1.4% last year compared with 2018, keeping German inflation well below the ECB target level of close to but below 2%.Economists expect unemployment to rise slightly this year. Yet a strong services sector should see more Germans entering the labour market."The employment trends should weaken but as long as it's predictable 2020 should set a new employment record and real wages should rise," said Martin Mueller of KfW bank.He forecast the workforce would expand by 200,000 to 45.4 million and that unemployment would rise by 50,000, pushing the jobless rate up to 5.1%."This prognosis is valid barring serious setbacks for the economy," added Mueller. "The risks for the economy are considerable. They include the trade conflict between the United States and China and the risk of a hard Brexit."(Writing by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Thomas Escritt and Giles Elgood)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersOne million Britons will be on zero-hour contracts by end of 2020The ConversationU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth-quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersWRAPUP 2-U.S. economy grows steadily in Q4, but coronavirus looms largeReutersNew Home Sales Raced to a 12.5-Year High: 5 Big WinnersZacksRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
