(NASDAQ:GOGO) Have A Volatile Share Price?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 3, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosAnyone researching Gogo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOGO) might want to consider the historical volatility of the share price. Modern finance theory considers volatility to be a measure of risk, and there are two main types of price volatility. First, we have company specific volatility, which is the price gyrations of an individual stock. Holding at least 8 stocks can reduce this kind of risk across a portfolio. The second type is the broader market volatility, which you cannot diversify away, since it arises from macroeconomic factors which directly affects all the stocks on the market.Some stocks are more sensitive to general market forces than others. Beta is a widely used metric to measure a stock's exposure to market risk (volatility). Before we go on, it's worth noting that Warren Buffett pointed out in his 2014 letter to shareholders that 'volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' Having said that, beta can still be rather useful. The first thing to understand about beta is that the beta of the overall market is one. A stock with a beta greater than one is more sensitive to broader market movements than a stock with a beta of less than one. See our latest analysis for Gogo What does GOGO's beta value mean to investors?With a beta of 0.99, (which is quite close to 1) the share price of Gogo has historically been about as voltile as the broader market. Using history as a guide, we might surmise that the share price is likely to be influenced by market voltility going forward but it probably won't be particularly sensitive to it. Beta is worth considering, but it's also important to consider whether Gogo is growing earnings and revenue. You can take a look for yourself, below.NasdaqGS:GOGO Income Statement, January 3rd 2020MoreCould GOGO's size cause it to be more volatile?Gogo is a small company, but not tiny and little known. It has a market capitalisation of US$545m, which means it would be on the radar of intstitutional investors. It takes less capital to move the share price of small companies, and they are also more impacted by company specific events, so it's a bit of a surprise that the beta is so close to the overall market.What this means for you:It is probable that there is a link between the share price of Gogo and the broader market, since it has a beta value quite close to one. However, long term investors are generally well served by looking past market volatility and focussing on the underlying development of the business. If that's your game, metrics such as revenue, earnings and cash flow will be more useful.
