Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Malmbergs Elektriska. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis OM:MEAB B Historical Dividend Yield, January 3rd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 64% of Malmbergs Elektriska's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. The company paid out 75% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is adequate, but reduces the wriggle room in the event of a downturn. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Malmbergs Elektriska's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.We update our data on Malmbergs Elektriska every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Malmbergs Elektriska has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was kr0.50 in 2010, compared to kr2.50 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 17% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.It's not great to see that the payment has been cut in the past. We're generally more wary of companies that have cut their dividend before, as they tend to perform worse in an economic downturn.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Over the past five years, it looks as though Malmbergs Elektriska's EPS have declined at around 10% a year. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and Malmbergs Elektriska's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Malmbergs Elektriska's is paying out more than half its income as dividends, but at least the dividend is covered by both reported earnings and cashflow. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and its dividend has been cut at least once in the past. In summary, Malmbergs Elektriska has a number of shortcomings that we'd find it hard to get past. Things could change, but we think there are a number of better ideas out there.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Malmbergs Elektriska stock.
