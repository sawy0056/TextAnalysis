See our latest analysis for Franklin Electric To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Franklin Electric achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.5% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 10% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:FELE Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreWe know that Franklin Electric has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Franklin Electric will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Franklin Electric's TSR for the last 5 years was 73%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Franklin Electric shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 41% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 12%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
