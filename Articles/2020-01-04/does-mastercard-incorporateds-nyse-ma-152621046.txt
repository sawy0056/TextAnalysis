The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Mastercard’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard What is Mastercard worth?According to my valuation model, Mastercard seems to be fairly priced at around 4.1% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Mastercard today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $316.35, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Mastercard’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Mastercard generate?NYSE:MA Past and Future Earnings, January 3rd 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 67% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Mastercard. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MA’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MA, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.
