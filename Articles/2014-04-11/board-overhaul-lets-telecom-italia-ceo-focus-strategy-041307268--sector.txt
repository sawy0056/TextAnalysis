"This time, there are real prospects for an improvement in domestic operating momentum against a backdrop of changing competitor behaviour."Berenberg upgraded the stock to "buy" on March 27 and set a target price of 1 euro, 13 percent above the current price.BRAZILIAN BREAK-UP?Telecom Italia needs to invest heavily in network upgrades at home to capture growing demand for broadband and fight rivals such as cash-rich Vodafone, while still striving to cut its net debt of nearly three times core profit.Patuano has around 2 billion euros of asset sales in the pipeline that could underpin his investment plans.Despite the board reform, he will face challenges in representing the interests of all shareholders when dealing with Telecom Italia's Brazilian wireless unit TIM Brasil, which competes directly with Telefonica.Telefonica is the largest investor in Telecom Italia, with an indirect stake of almost 15 percent, and has the option to increase its holding. The group would like to break up TIM Brasil and share its assets with other Brazilian telecom companies, sources close to Telefonica have said.But Fossati, the dissident investor, has said Telecom Italia should keep TIM Brasil and seek a tie-up with Brazilian broadband operator GVT, owned by France's Vivendi."Telco has removed the conflict of interest," said Sergio Carbonara, founder of proxy adviser Frontis Governance, referring to the board candidates put forward by Telco."But there are still risks the board could be influenced given that Patuano, who is somehow the expression of the majority shareholder, has strong expertise and there is no-one who can really balance him in his role as company chief," he said.Telefonica's involvement in Telecom Italia has landed it with a dilemma in Brazil, where the Spanish company controls the top mobile phone company Vivo.Its parallel, indirect stake in TIM Brasil has caught Telefonica in the crosshairs of Brazil's competition watchdog, which has ordered it to scale back its presence in the country by mid-2015, according to sources familiar with the matter.Patuano has said TIM Brasil, which has a market value of more than $12 billion (7 billion pounds), is not on the block. But he would consider a sale if he were to receive a "jumbo" offer.A source familiar with the matter said Patuano will buy time on Brazil, allowing the Spanish group to push ahead with its strategy of trying to join up with partners such as Grupo Oi and Mexico's America Movil to make a possible joint offer for TIM Brasil towards the end of the year.TIM Brasil's new owners would then break the company up, placating the Brazilian regulator.But if Telefonica's Brazilian plans fail, it may have to consider selling its stake in Telecom Italia to satisfy the regulator."At one point, in the next six to 12 months, Telefonica will have to decide: either be a full partner or give up and say goodbye," a Telecom Italia investor said, asking not to be named.(Editing by Lisa Jucca and Tom Pfeiffer)
