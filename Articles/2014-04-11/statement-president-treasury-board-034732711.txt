OTTAWA, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Apr 10, 2014) -The President of the Treasury Board issued the following statement:Earlier this week, an Internet security vulnerability named the Heartbleed bug, caused by a flaw in OpenSSL software was detected. OpenSSL is a commonly used software used on the Internet to provide security and privacy.The Heartbleed bug is affecting many global IT systems in both private and public sector organizations and has the potential to expose private data.This evening the Chief Information Officer for the Government of Canada issued a directive to all federal government departments to immediately disable public websites that are running unpatched OpenSSL software. This action is being taken as a precautionary measure until the appropriate security patches are in place and tested.As a result, Canadians will be unable to access certain Government of Canada websites while measures are being applied.We understand that this will be disruptive, but, under the circumstances, this is the best course of action to protect the privacy of Canadians.IF THERE IS A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN ANY PRINTED VERSION AND THE ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THIS NEWS RELEASE, THE ELECTRONIC VERSION WILL PREVAIL.TTY (Telecommunications device for the hearing impaired) - (613) 957-9090This news release is available online at: www.tbs-sct.gc.ca.
