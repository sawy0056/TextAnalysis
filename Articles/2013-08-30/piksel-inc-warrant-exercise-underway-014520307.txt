NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Aug 29, 2013) - Piksel, Inc., (formerly known as KIT digital, Inc., the "Company"), a global provider of digital television and media solutions, announced that the period to exercise warrants under the Company's plan of reorganization is now fully underway and distribution of warrant certificates and election forms for shareholders of KIT digital, Inc. to elect to exercise their warrants is nearing completion.Warrant certificates and election forms have been mailed to, and should have already been received by, record holders of KIT digital Inc.'s common stock that did not hold such shares through a broker or other nominee. Record holders that have not yet received those materials should contact Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company at 1-800-509-5586.For shareholders whose shares are held in street name (i.e., in the name of a broker or other nominee), the election forms must be delivered through the required back office service providers. Shareholders that hold in street name will be receiving an election form but will not be receiving warrant certificates. Brokers and other nominees for such shareholders should be receiving those materials in the next couple of days. Brokers or nominees that want to verify they are on the distribution list to receive election forms may call Morrow & Co. at 1-800-662-5200.For brokers and shareholders that would like to review the materials relevant to the exercise of warrants but have not yet received warrant certificates and election forms, the form of the warrant certificate and election forms are exhibits to the Warrant Agreement the Company entered into with the transfer agent, which is available for review on the Company's website at http://ir.kitd.com under "Plan of Reorganization."Although those exhibits may be helpful for brokers and record shareholders to review in advance of receiving their election forms, brokers and record shareholders are required to submit the actual election form and, if applicable, warrant certificate, received from the transfer agent and should not attempt to fill out and submit the form of certificate and election form attached as exhibits to the Warrant Agreement on the Company's website.About PikselWe help the world's leading brands maximize their reach and return with video.Comprised of a global team of experts we call 'televisionaries', Piksel has helped to design, build, and manage online video services for major media companies like AT&T, BSkyB, Celcom, Mediaset, Sky Deutschland and Televisa, as well as enterprise brands like Airbus, Barnes & Noble, and Volkswagen.Headquartered in New York City, Piksel offices can be found throughout Europe and the Americas, serving more than 1,600 clients in over 50 countries.Follow the company on Twitter at www.twitter.com/piksel
