The Thaibaht has fallen 2.4 percent and the Malaysian ringgithas weakened 1.6 percent.The Fed is expected to start scaling back its bond-buyingprogramme next month. An upward revision to second-quarter U.S.economic growth bolstered the views."September will be a rough month for Asian FX, with thepotential Fed taper and sustained nervousness towards emergingmarkets," said Emmanuel Ng, a foreign exchange strategist forOCBC Bank in Singapore.When asked which Asian currencies will be most vulnerable,Ng said: "they are going to be the usual suspects, such as therupee, the rupiah and the ringgit, as markets sniff out theweakest links."Short positions in the rupee and some Southeast Asiancurrencies hit the highest levels since the global financialcrisis in 2008 during the last two weeks as sentiment onregional currencies deteriorated, a Reuters poll showed onThursday.The rupee and the rupiah are seen as especially vulnerableto an anticipated reduction in the Fed's quantitative easing.Both India and Indonesia are struggling with growing currentaccount deficits, slowing economic growth and strong resistanceto implementing much-needed reforms.Despite spreading gloom in South and Southeast Asiancurrencies, their Northeast Asian peers enjoyed monthly gains.The South Korean won has risen 1.3 percent oncapital inflows and exporters' demand for settlements. TheTaiwan dollar has risen 0.7 percent.Investors dedicated to emerging Asian markets are bettingthat Northeast Asian currencies will fare better than theirSoutheast Asian counterparts due to superior fiscal and currentaccount positions.Their high-tech exports have proved more resilient to theglobal slowdown, especially China's more recent slowdown, thanSoutheast Asian economies which are heavily reliant on exportsof commodities and raw materials.RINGGITThe ringgit rose as offshore funds covered short positions,but its upside was limited by dollar demand from custodian banksin Malaysia.Those custodian banks bought dollars below 3.3000 to theringgit, traders said.The Malaysian currency is expected to stay weaker inSeptember as investors are keeping an eye on if the Fed startswinding down quantitative easing."There are so many uncertainties, such as Syria, U.S.tapering and fund exits from emerging Asia," said a seniorMalaysian bank trader in Kuala Lumpur, adding the ringgit islikely to fall further.The ringgit saw some support at 3.3345 per dollar, the 50percent Fibonacci retracement of its appreciation between 2009and 2011.But the Malaysian unit may weaken to 3.3640, its weakestlevel in May 2010, once the retracement is broken, analystssaid.PHILIPPINE PESOThe peso gained as overall strength in regional units causedinvestors to cover short positions.The Philippine currency, however, gave up some of initialgains on dollar demand from local companies, traders said.Despite improvement in sentiment, onshore players includinglenders and corporates prefer dollars, they added."We could see a bit more upside in dollar/peso as it haslagged the bigger rises in dollar/rupiah and dollar/rupee," saida senior Philippine bank trader in Manila.The peso may weaken to mid-45 per dollar in September.Another trader said the peso may find support around 45.50,given increasing remittance inflows in the next coming months.Story continuesRUPIAHThe rupiah edged up 0.1 percent to 10,910 per dollar in theinterbank market as the central bank was spotted providingdollar liquidity and a day after Bank Indonesia announcedfurther measures to shore up the currency, including rate hikes.Banks in the country, however, still bought dollars above11,000 for their customers, traders said, indicating investorsdid not see the new steps as sufficient to halt the rupiah'sslide.HSBC said Thursday's actions were constructive, but they maynot be enough to support the rupiah."In our view restoring price discovery is still critical andmore policy support will be needed to stabilize the IDR," itsaid in a note.Forwards markets pointed further depreciation in the rupiahwith one-month non-deliverable forwards to dollarweakening to 11,440.BAHTThe baht advanced on exporters' demand for month-endsettlements and as some Japanese banks bought the currency.Ten- and 5-year government bond yieldsalso slid.Still, investors hesitated to push the baht stronger than32.00 per dollar, before July current account and trade datalater in the day.CURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLARChange on the day at 0430 GMTCurrency Latest bid Previous day Pct MoveJapan yen 98.26 98.35 +0.09Sing dlr 1.2751 1.2755 +0.03Taiwan dlr 29.922 30.012 +0.30Korean won 1109.10 1109.70 +0.05Baht 32.08 32.18 +0.31Peso 44.63 44.75 +0.28Rupiah 10910.00 10920.00 +0.09Rupee 67.40 66.56 -1.25Ringgit 3.2985 3.3135 +0.45Yuan 6.1205 6.1205 -0.00Change so far in 2013Currency Latest bid End prev year Pct MoveJapan yen 98.26 86.79 -11.67Sing dlr 1.2751 1.2219 -4.17Taiwan dlr 29.922 29.136 -2.63Korean won 1109.10 1070.60 -3.47Baht 32.08 30.61 -4.58Peso 44.63 41.05 -8.01Rupiah 10910.00 9630.00 -11.73Rupee 67.40 54.99 -18.41Ringgit 3.2985 3.0580 -7.29Yuan 6.1205 6.2303 +1.79(Additional reporting by IFR Markets' Catherine Tan; Editing byKim Coghill)
