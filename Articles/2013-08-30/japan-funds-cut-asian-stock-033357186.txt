Even so, it is still up 30 percent this year.RAISING EUROPEAN BONDSBond weighting for the U.K. and Europe rose to 6.9 percent from 6.7 percent in July, and to 22.2 percent from 21.8 percent, respectively, on signs of economic growth, with data showing the U.K. economy had grown more than expected in the second quarter.Germany also confirmed solid second-quarter growth."Yields in the global market are rising on the economic recovery and expectations that the Fed will trim its monthly bond buying," Meiji Yasuda's Kodama said.But the asset managers reduced weighting for bonds in Canada and the U.S. marginally to an eight-month low of 26.9 percent from 27.9 percent in July, as U.S. long-term yields hit a two-year high.Earlier this month, benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit 2.94 percent, their highest levels since July 2011. As yields rose many investors sold bonds and moved to the sidelines, anticipating increased volatility heading into the all-important Fed meeting on September 17-18, where the decision when to start tapering could be taken.(Editing by Eric Meijer)
