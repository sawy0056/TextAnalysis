Support:103.75 (Mar 7 high), 103.00, 102. 62 (Triangle top)
Resistance: 104.14 (38.2% Fib exp.), 105.19 (50% Fib exp.) The US Dollar advanced for a fifth consecutive day against the Japanese Yen having launched higher as expected after carving out a Triangle chart pattern. Prices are now testing resistance at 104.14, the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion, with a break above that targeting the 50% level at 105.19. Alternatively, a turn back below the May 7 high at 103.75 (now recast as support) aims for the 103.00 figure, followed by a horizontal pivot at 102.62. We booked partial profits on a long position from 102.82 earlier this week and continue to hold half of the trade with a stop adjusted to the breakeven level.
