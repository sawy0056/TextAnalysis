ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA--(Marketwired - Dec 1, 2013) - The Australian International Documentary Conference (AIDC), held during DocWeek 2014, is announcing Let's Talk. Let's Talk is AIDC's new market initiative replacing its pre-sale market; MeetMarket and is supported by Screen Australia.Let's Talk is a response to the changing financing methods of documentary films and factual programs. The purpose of Let's Talk is to build relationships and is open for all delegates to participate in. There is no project selection process involved. Let's Talk delivers the benefits of facilitated meetings to the whole conference community and will help ease the well known market anxiety of making sure you speak to all the right people before you go home. Let's Talk levels the playing field and allows for those in the business without established networks to build them up quickly and efficiently.Whilst MeetMarket has delivered great outcomes for Australian screen businesses since 2006, AIDC feels that the pre-sale market for documentary has weakened in recent years. Let's Talk operates under the principle that relationships come first and ideas come later. Let's Talk allows for introductions and the start of collaborations. Let's Talk facilitates all financing models, not just the pre-sale market.Let's Talk turns AIDC into an open, inviting and outward looking modern content market, ready to facilitate a wide variety of businesses, interests and ideas at any level of experience.All registered delegates will be invited to schedule the meetings of their choice prior to the conference in February 2014 through an online process.DocWeek, Australia's international documentary event, including the Australian International Documentary Conference (AIDC) www.docweek.org.au
