Markets finally ended their five-day losing streak and finished in the green. Benchmarks were oscillating between small gains and losses in the morning as investors awaited developments on the Fiscal Cliff issue. But markets moved higher in the final hour of the trading after news circulated that U.S lawmakers are close to sealing a deal on the Fiscal Cliff issue. In recent days the Fiscal Cliff issue has completely dominated markets and benchmarks were moving on either side depending upon the developments related to the issue.
President Barack Obama said Congress is close to sealing a deal on the Fiscal Cliff issue without increasing tax rates for middle-class. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also said lawmakers are “very, very close,” to sealing a deal on the Fiscal Cliff issue. But the House of Representatives did not plan to vote on the federal budget before January 1. However, Congress can prevent the adverse effects of the Fiscal Cliff through a retroactive vote right at the start of 2013
According to a source familiar with the issue, if Congress and President Barack Obama give a green signal to the new plan, it will raise $600 billion in revenue over the next decade. Additionally, individuals earnings above $400,000 and households earning more than $450,000 annually will have to pay higher taxes.
Despite a recent fall due to the Fiscal Cliff, benchmarks ended 2012 on a high note. The Dow Jones gained 7.3%, the S&P 500 surged 13.4% and Nasdaq added 15.9% in 2012. This is the S&P 500’s best yearly gain in three years. The most important factors that pushed the benchmarks higher in 2012 are the recovery in the U.S. housing sector and relatively better employment conditions. The Federal Reserve’s announcement of QE3 in September has also helped benchmarks move higher. The financial sector gained 26.3% in 2012 and was the biggest gainer among the S&P 500 industry groups whereas the utilities sector was the sole loser. The utilities sector lost 2.9% in 2012.
