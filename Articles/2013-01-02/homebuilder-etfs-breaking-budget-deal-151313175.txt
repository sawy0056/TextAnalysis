Housing ETFs such as iShares DJ US Home Construction (ITB) and SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) were breaking out to new multiyear highs Wednesday after U.S. lawmakers finally cinched a deal to prevent the U.S. from falling over the fiscal cliff.The homebuilder ETFs were up about 3% in early trading and were among the sector leaders in Wednesday’s rally after leaders in Washington reached a last-second compromise that avoided bigger tax increases and spending cuts that threatened to push the U.S. into recession.The builder ETFs have more than tripled since the 2009 low but they have yet to recoup even half of the losses they suffered during the housing bust.

According to the data, home prices are on track to record their first annual gain since 2006, The Wall Street Journal reported.SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETFhomebuilder-etf-1Morehomebuilder-etf-2MoreThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of John Spence, and may not actually come to pass.
