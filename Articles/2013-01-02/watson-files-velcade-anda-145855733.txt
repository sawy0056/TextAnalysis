Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (WPI) recently announced that it is seeking FDA approval for its generic version of Millennium Pharma’s Velcade (bortezomib). Millennium Pharma is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharma (TKPYY). The abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) was filed by Actavis, Inc. Actavis was acquired by Watson Pharma in October 2012.
Velcade is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma as well as mantle cell lymphoma in patients who have received at least one prior treatment. As per IMS Health, US sales of Velcade for the 12 months ending October 31, 2012, were $740 million.
Millennium Pharma filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Actavis on December 21, 2012. This means that final FDA approval cannot be granted for up to 30 months from the date on which Millennium Pharma received notice regarding the ANDA filing or until final resolution of the matter before the court, whichever happens first.
