2013 begins with the USDJPY testing resistance from late 2008 / early 2009 lows (weekly chart) and sharp channel resistance (see daily chart). The rally since the beginning of December can be best described as parabolic, especially since 12/26. In Elliott parlance, a parabolic move is usually a 3rd or C wave. If the current rally composes a 3rd wave, then we’ve probably reached or are very close to reaching ‘fever pitch’ and giving way to a corrective decline. Weakness below 8650 would be the trigger for me to begin a short position towards at least 8565.--- Written by Jamie Saettele, CMT, Senior Technical Strategist for DailyFX.comTo contact Jamie e-mail jsaettele@dailyfx.com.Follow me on Twitter for real time updates @JamieSaetteleSubscribe to Jamie Saettele's distribution list in order to receive actionable FX trading strategy delivered to your inbox.Jamie is the author of Sentiment in the Forex Market.DailyFX provides forex news and technical analysis on the trends that influence the global currency markets.Learn forex trading with a free practice account and trading charts from FXCM.
