Intel's plan to disrupt the cable TV industry is facing some setbacks, Don Clark and Christopher Stewart of The Wall Street Journal report.Intel wants to launch its own set-top box, which would allow people to subscribe to individual channels. The plan was to release it in limited beta this March.But now it seems that we might have to wait a little while longer.That's because the company is having a hard time reaching content licensing agreements with media companies, sources familiar with Intel's plans tell the Journal.Intel reportedly has at least one content deal, but is facing difficulties persuading other companies to license individual channels.Another issue is that Intel has little to no experience delivering products directly to the end user, which has made some television executives feel skeptical. "Intel can help with a lot of the heavy lifting in technology," former Rovi Vice President of Strategy and Innovation told the WSJ. "But if they think they are going to take on the device that the consumer uses they are wrong."More From Business Insider More Details On Intel's Secret Plan To Beat Apple With Its Own TV ServiceIntel Is Reportedly Going To Destroy The Cable Model By Offering People The Ability To Subscribe To Individual ChannelsTHE END OF SMARTPHONES: The Latest Rumor Is That Apple Is Working On A Computer Watch
