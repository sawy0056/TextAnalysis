Charlie Hebdo, the long-running French satirical magazine, has published what it's website calls a "halal" comic book on the life of Islamic prophet Mohammad.The publication of the book, which is selling for 6 euros on the Charlie Hebdo website, is just the latest in a long line of provocative moves from the publication.For example, after re-publishing Danish cartoons of Mohammad in 2011 the magazine's Paris offices were firebombed. The magazine then published a new cover featuring their editor and a man dressed in traditional Islamic clothing kissing.The magazine also published a new depiction of Mohammad last year at the height of the controversy over the Innocence Of Muslims film.AFP today quotes Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier as saying the book was created with the help of a Islamic Franco-Tunisian sociologist, and denied claims Muslims would find it offensive."Before having a laugh about a character, it's better to know him. As much as we know about the life of Jesus, we know nothing about Mohammad," Charbonnier said.It seems fair to question Charbonnier is correct in his assumption that no-one will be insulted — in Islam, Mohammad is never allowed to be depicted (even if the depiction is not in itself insulting), and the first page of the comic book reportedly features a drawing of naked men wearing turbans. However at present the reaction to the book appears to be muted.More From Business Insider HOUSE APPROVES FISCAL CLIFF DEAL 257-167Intel Is Reportedly Going To Destroy The Cable Model By Offering People The Ability To Subscribe To Individual Channels6 Things You Won't Believe That Are In The Fiscal Cliff Bill That The Senate Passed At 2 AM While Most Americans Were Drunk
