Kinsman Swim signature look is lingerie-inspired designs that resemble top-shelf lingerie.View photosLos Angeles, CA, USA / ACCESSWIRE / March 6, 2014 / Style Fashion Week is back this March with a stunning line up of designers taking over the runways like never before.Now in their 7th season, the mega-fashion event welcomes designer Joanna Kinsman of Kinsman Swim to showcase her latest Signature Collection, as well as 2014 designs, on Tuesday, March 11th at 5PM.Kinsman Swim is comprised of lingerie-inspired looks that resemble top-shelf lingerie, and are hand-sewn in Southern California. The designer got her start while living on the East Coast, but quickly resorted to Los Angeles, where she developed a cohesive, sultry line of Brazilian cut bikinis.Yet LA wasn’t ready for the scantily cut designs, and at the first debut in Hollywood, some models weren’t able to walk for the brand, as tan lines were an issue on the runway. Since then, it seems that the industry has taken a liking to the extravagantly risqué collection, and Joanna is thrilled to take part in her first LA Fashion Week runway premier.“It’s such a distinct privilege to be invited to show at such a high profile event, and what an honor to see all of my hard work and networking over the years hugely paying off. This is truly a pivotal opportunity for me as a designer,” stated Kinsman, having recently relocated from Marina del Rey to San Diego.The luxury swimwear company remains based in Los Angeles, and is growing quite a reputation for stunning, jaw-dropping silhouettes. The Kinsman Swim name is synonymous with designs that push the envelope, but as one of Kinsman’s models, Arlene Sara put it, “LA needs more butt cheeks.” Simple as that.Style Fashion Week LA is the largest, most influential fashion event of the season. This time around, events will be held March 9th-13th on the renowned L.A. LIVE Event Deck.
