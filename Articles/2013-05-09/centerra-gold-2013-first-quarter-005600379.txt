The condensed interim financial statements of Centerra are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and the Company's accounting policies as described in note 3 of its annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 and for the effect of the adoption of new accounting standards on January 1, 2013 as described in note 2 to the Company's March 31, 2013 condensed interim financial statements. All figures are in United States dollars.)To view Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Financial Statements and Notes for the three-months ended March 31, 2013, please visit the following link: http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/CGQ1_MDAFS.pdf.Centerra Gold Inc. today reported net earnings for the first quarter of 2013 of $51.4 million or $0.22 per common share reflecting higher gold sales due to the higher gold production at both operations during the period. For the same period in 2012, the Company recorded net earnings of $9.6 million or $0.04 per common share. The 2012 results were impacted by a 10-day work stoppage at Kumtor in February 2012 and the acceleration of ice and waste material at Kumtor which required a change in the mine plan. The 2012 results have been restated to reflect the retroactive adoption of a change in accounting for stripping costs under IFRIC 20.2013 First Quarter HighlightsStory continuesProduced 115,220 ounces of gold in the quarter, including 89,618 ounces at Kumtor and 25,602 ounces at Boroo, compared to 72,555 ounces in the same period in 2012.Increased revenues to $192.3 million compared to $133.8 million in the same quarter of 2012.Cash provided by operations increased to $92.0 million compared to $32.0 million in the first quarter of 2012.Operating cash cost per ounce produced of $471 compared to $685 in the same period in 2012Reported all-in cash cost (pre-tax) for the quarter of $1,327 per ounce compared to $2,902 for the 2012 first quarter.Acquired the remaining 30% interest in the Öksüt project in Turkey.Achieved 3 million man-hours without a lost time injury (LTI) at the Boroo mine.Experienced accelerated movement in the Davidov Valley Waste-rock Dump at Kumtor.CommentaryIan Atkinson, President and CEO of Centerra Gold commented, "Operationally we are on track to achieve our production guidance for the year. Boroo had an excellent quarter producing almost 26,000 ounces of gold. Kumtor produced almost 90,000 ounces of gold, and mine production is on track to achieve the annual gold production forecast with over 50% of the gold production occurring in the fourth quarter. Financially, we reported over $51 million or $0.22 per share in net earnings and the operations generated $92 million or $0.39 per share of cash flow for the first quarter.""As expected at the Kumtor mine the waste-rock dump is experiencing movement as was disclosed in the KS-13 expansion plan. The movement has recently increased impacting the workshops and administration facilities ahead of the planned schedule. As a result, we have expedited the demolition of the buildings and relocation of other infrastructure sooner than had been planned to ensure continued safe operations. Planned gold production for 2013 has not been affected to date. Employees have been moved to temporary work locations until the planned new facilities are constructed.""Also regarding Kumtor, we are continuing to have discussions with the Kyrgyz authorities to resolve the issues concerning Kumtor to the benefit of all Centerra shareholders.""Recently we have seen tremendous volatility in the gold price. We are monitoring and assessing its impact on the operations and are reviewing spending plans for 2013. Exploration spending in 2013 at Kumtor has been reduced by $5 million and further reductions may be contemplated in other areas. The Company has a strong balance sheet and continuing good margins even in a lower gold price environment. Our all-in costs including all capital and taxes are forecast to be in the range of $1,247 to $1,360 per ounce of gold produced for the year."Waste-Rock Dump MovementOn May 3, 2013, the Company announced that a large section of Kumtor's principal waste-rock dump, the Davidov Valley Waste-rock Dump (Central Valley Waste Dump), was experiencing a greater than anticipated rate of movement. Beginning in mid-March, the rate of movement of the waste-rock dump increased beyond the anticipated rate, requiring acceleration to the planned demolition of the administration and workshop buildings and the relocation of certain other infrastructure. Employees in the affected buildings were moved to temporary work locations while new planned facilities are constructed. The movement of the Davidov Valley Waste-rock Dump and the demolition of buildings and relocation of other affected infrastructure is described in the Kumtor Technical Report (December 20, 2012) and in the life-of-mine plan. As a result of this increase in movement, the Company has discontinued deposition of waste-rock on the affected portion of the Davidov Valley Waste-rock Dump (Central Valley Waste Dump). In the short-term, the Company is placing waste-rock on permitted sites currently unaffected by the movement. An alternative long-term waste-rock dumping plan is being finalized. The Company is working with the Kyrgyz regulatory authorities and external engineering advisors to expedite approval of such a plan. Based on discussions with the authorities to date, the Company believes that such approvals are likely to be forthcoming, however no assurances can be provided.The Government has established a special commission, which has visited the Kumtor mine site and inspected the waste-rock dump movement. The Company is fully cooperating with the commission.While the Company expects that it will be able to develop alternative plans that will permit the mine to continue planned operations and that such alternative plans will receive prompt regulatory approval from the Kyrgyz authorities, the Company cannot give assurances in this regard. In the event that an alternative plan cannot be developed or approved promptly, the Company would expect a negative impact on its mine operations, production and financial results.Financial and Operating Summary  Highlights   Three Months Ended March 31    2012   Financial Summary ($ millions, except as noted)2013 Restated(5) % Change Revenue$192.3 $133.8 44%Cost of sales 91.1  79.1 15%Abnormal mining costs -  0.7 (100%)Mine standby costs -  4.6 (100%)Regional office administration 5.6  4.8 17%Earnings from mine operations 95.5  44.6 114%Revenue-based taxes 20.8  15.1 38%Other operating expenses 1.9  1.5 30%Exploration and business development 7.2  8.3 (14%)Corporate administration 6.7  8.5 (21%)Earnings from operations 58.9  11.2 424%Other (income) and expenses 1.3  (0.8)(260%)Finance costs 1.3  0.9 40%Earnings before income taxes 56.3  11.1 406%Income tax expense 4.9  1.5 228%Net earnings$51.4 $9.6 434%         Earnings per common share - $ basic 0.22 $0.04 450%Earnings per common share - $ diluted 0.21 $0.04 425%Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic (thousands) 236,376  236,354 0%Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted (thousands) 236,964  237,030 (0%)Cash provided by (used in) operations 92.0  32.0 188%Capital expenditures (1) 103.9  158.4 (34%)         Operating Summary        Gold produced - ounces 115,220  72,555 59%Gold sold - ounces 118,745  77,720 53%Average realized gold price - $/oz 1,619  1,721 (6%)Average gold spot price - $/oz (2) 1,631  1,691 (4%)         Cost of sales - $/oz sold (3) 767  1,018 (25%)Operating cash costs - $/oz produced (3) (4) 471  685 (31%)All-in cash costs (pre-tax) - $/oz produced (3) (4) 1,327  2,902 (54%)All-in cash costs (including taxes) - $/oz produced (3) (4) 1,552  3,130 (50%)(1)Includes capitalized stripping of $74.3 million in first quarter of 2013 ($62.9 million in first quarter of 2012).(2)Average for the period as reported by the London Bullion Market Association (US dollar Gold P.M.

Operating cash costs and all-in cash costs per ounce produced, as well as cost of sales per ounce sold, are non-GAAP measures and are discussed under "Non-GAAP Measures".(4)All-in cash costs per ounce produced includes operating cash costs, sustaining and growth capital, corporate general and administrative expenses, global exploration expenses and community investments. The measure is presented pre or after tax, including or excluding revenue-based taxes at Kumtor and income taxes at Boroo.(5)Restated for the change in accounting for deferred stripping under IFRIC 20 which was adopted retroactively in 2012 (see note 2 of the Company's condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period ending March 31, 2013).Revenue for the first quarter of 2013, increased to $192.3 million from $133.8 million in the comparative quarter of 2012, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes (118,745 ounces sold in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 77,720 ounces sold in the first quarter of 2012). This was partially offset by a decrease in average realized gold prices at $1,619 per ounce compared to $1,721 per ounce in the same quarter of 2012. The higher sales volumes reflect the increase in gold production at both operations.Total gold produced in the first quarter was 115,220 ounces compared to 72,555 ounces reported in the first quarter of 2012, a 59% increase year-over-year. The increased gold production was mainly due to the processing of higher grade ore at both Kumtor and at Boroo and the resumption of heap leach operations at Boroo which began in the fourth quarter of 2012. During the comparative period of 2012, Kumtor processed fewer tonnes due to the 10-day labour dispute.Cost of sales was $91.1 million in the first quarter of 2013, compared to $79.1 million in the comparative period of 2012, mainly as a result of higher sales volumes. Operating costs in the first quarter of 2013 were higher than the comparative quarter reflecting higher labour costs, resulting from inflation adjustments from the collective agreements which were finalized in the second half of 2012, and the addition of heap leach costs at Boroo from the resumption of heap leach operations.Depreciation, depletion and amortization associated with production increased to $40.8 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $20.3 million in the comparative quarter of 2012 as a result of the higher ounces sold, increased depreciation from the expanded mobile fleet at Kumtor and the higher amortization of deferred stripping costs at Kumtor.Exploration expenditures in the first quarter of 2013 were $7.2 million compared to $7.8 million in the same quarter last year, with drilling programs at Kumtor and at the Öksüt project in Turkey as well as at the Company's joint ventures in Russia.Cash provided by operations was $92.0 million for the first quarter of 2013 compared to $32.0 million for the prior year first quarter, primarily reflecting the increased earnings in 2013 as a result of higher production and sales volumes and lower working capital levels.Capital expenditures spent and accrued in the first quarter of 2013 amounted to $103.9 million which includes $13.4 million of sustaining capital, $16.2 million invested in growth capital and $74.3 million on capitalized stripping. Capital expenditures in the comparative quarter of 2012 totaled $158.4 million, consisting of $6.1 million of sustaining capital, $89.4 million invested in growth capital and $62.9 million of capitalized stripping.Centerra's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of March 2013 decreased to $369.9 million from $382.1 million at December 31, 2012. At March 31, 2013, the Company had $76 million outstanding on its $150 million revolving credit facility with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), leaving a balance of $74 million undrawn at March 31, 2013. The amount drawn is due to be repaid on August 8, 2013, or at the Company's discretion repayment could be extended. Centerra believes, based on its current forecast, that it has sufficient cash and investments to carry out its business plan in 2013 (see "2013 Outlook").All-in cash costs - Consolidated (1)  Three Months Ended March 31$ millions, except ounces poured20132012 (3)All-in Cash Costs:  Operating cash costs54.249.7Capitalized stripping and ice unload - cash53.447.0Operating cash costs and capitalized stripping107.696.7Sustaining capital (cash)13.36.1Growth capital (cash)16.289.4Operating cash costs including capital137.1192.2Corporate and other cash costs (2)15.818.3All-in Cash Costs - pre-tax152.9210.5Revenue-based tax and income tax25.916.6   All-in Cash Costs - including taxes178.8227.1   Ounces poured115,22072,555Operating cash cost - $/oz produced471685All-in Cash Costs (pre-tax) - $/oz produced1,3272,902All-in Cash Costs (including taxes) - $/oz produced1,5523,130(1) All-in cash costs, capitalized stripping (cash) and sustaining and growth capital are non-GAAP Measures and are discussed under "Non-GAAP Measures".(2) Corporate and other cash costs include corporate general and administrative expenses, global exploration expenses, and community investments.(3) Operating cash costs and capitalized stripping for 2012 were restated for the impact of the adoption of IFRIC 20.Operating cash costs per ounce produced in the first quarter of 2013 decreased to $471 compared to $685 per ounce in the comparative period of 2012 (operating cash cost per ounce produced is a non-GAAP measure and is discussed under "Non-GAAP Measures"). The decrease in 2013 reflects the impact of higher production levels due to higher grades processed at both operations and increased recoveries at Kumtor.On a pre-tax basis all-in cash costs per ounce produced for the first quarter of 2013 was $1,327, and includes all cash costs directly related to gold production. This compares to pre-tax all-in cash costs of $2,902 per ounce produced in the first quarter of 2012. The decrease is due to a combination of lower growth and sustaining capital spending and higher production in 2013. The cash costs for capitalized stripping and ice unload activities incurred in the first quarter of 2013 amounted to $53.4 million compared to $47.0 million in the comparative quarter of 2012, reflecting the increased focus on removing ice and waste from the high movement area at Kumtor the cost of which is treated as capital following the decision to expand the pit on November 7, 2012. Growth capital expenditures (excluding capitalized stripping) cash costs decreased from $89.4 million in the first quarter of 2012 to $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2013, reflecting the expansion of the mining fleet at Kumtor during 2012.Including revenue-based taxes in the Kyrgyz Republic and income taxes in Mongolia, the Company's all-in cash costs per ounce produced for the first quarter of 2013 was $1,552 compared to $3,130 in the comparative quarter of 2012.Operations Update         Three Months Ended March 31 Kumtor Operating Results 2013 2012 (6) % Change Gold sold - ounces 91,617 62,196 147%Average realized gold price - $/oz 1,623 1,732 94%Revenue - $ millions 148.7 107.7 138%Cost of sales - $ millions (1) 66.3 62.8 106%Cost of sales - $/oz sold (1) 724 1,010 72%Tonnes mined - 000s 40,184 30,746 131%Tonnes ore mined - 000s 209 63 332%Average mining grade - g/t (2) 2.45 1.33 184%Tonnes milled - 000s 1,473 1,252 118%Average mill head grade - g/t (2) 2.69 1.98 136%Recovery - % 74.1 72.6 102%Gold produced - ounces 89,618 60,707 148%        Operating cash cost - $/oz produced (3) 452 642 70%All-in cash cost (pre-tax) - $/oz produced (4) 1,359 2,934 46%All-in cash cost including tax - $/oz 1,591 3,183 50%        Capital expenditures - $ millions (5) 102.2 126.2 81%Boroo Operating Results       Gold sold - ounces 27,128 15,524 175%Average realized gold price - $/oz 1,606 1,676 96%Revenue - $ millions 43.6 26.0 167%Cost of sales - $ millions (1) 24.9 16.3 153%Cost of sales - $/oz sold (1) 918 1,050 87%Total tonnes mined - 000s - 1,920 - Tonnes mined heap leach - 000s - - - Tonnes stacked heap leach - 000s 268 - - Tonnes under leach - 000s 1,803 - - Tonnes ore mined direct mill feed - 000's - - - Tonnes ore milled - 000s 572 590 97%Average mill head grade - g/t (2) 1.54 0.77 200%Recovery - % 54.0 79.2 68%Gold produced - ounces 25,602 11,848 216%        Operating cash cost - $/oz produced (3) 535 905 59%All-in cash cost (pre-tax) - $/oz produced (4) 582 1,179 49%All-in cash cost including tax - $/oz 782 1,311 60%        Capital expenditures - $ millions (Boroo) (5) 1.2 3.7 33%Capital expenditures - $ millions (Gatsuurt) 0.1 0.1 93%(1)Cost of sales excludes regional office administration.(2)g/t means grams of gold per tonne.(3)Operating cash cost is comprised of mine operating costs such as mining, processing, regional office administration, royalties and production taxes (except at Kumtor where revenue-based taxes are excluded), but excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, reclamation costs, capital investments, community investments, exploration expenses and corporate general and administration expenses.

The increase in ounces poured was mainly due to processing of higher grade ore that was mined and stockpiled during the fourth quarter of 2012. During the first quarter of 2013, Kumtor's mill head grade averaged 2.69 g/t with a recovery of 74.1%, compared with 1.98 g/t and a recovery of 72.6% for the same quarter in 2012. Tonnes processed were approximately 1.5 million for the first quarter of 2013, 18% higher than the comparative period in 2012 which was impacted by lower mill operating time due to the 10-day work stoppage and resulting re-start period.Beginning in mid-March, the rate of movement of the Davidov Valley Waste-rock Dump (Central Valley Waste Dump) increased beyond the anticipated rate, requiring acceleration to the planned demolition of the administration and workshop buildings and relocation of certain other infrastructure. Employees in the affected buildings have been moved to temporary work locations until new facilities are constructed. Planned gold production has not been affected. The rate of acceleration is being monitored and an alternative long-term waste-rock dumping plan is being finalized.Operating cash cost per ounce produced in the first quarter of 2013 decreased to $452 compared to $642 per ounce in the comparative period of 2012. The decrease in 2013 reflects the impact of higher production levels, as a result of processing material with higher mill head grades and recoveries. This was partially offset by higher operating costs described below. Operating cash costs per ounce produced is a non-GAAP measure and is discussed under "Non-GAAP Measures".In the first quarter of 2013, operating cash costs including capitalized stripping and ice unloading at Kumtor (see "Non-GAAP Measures") increased by $10.7 million due to higher mining costs, which increased by $9.6 million. Higher mining costs in the first quarter of 2013 were the result of increased operating days, which resulted in increased consumption of consumables such as diesel, tires and maintenance, as compared to the same period in 2012 which was effected by a 10-day work stoppage. Labour costs in the first quarter 2013 increased as a result of the new 2-year Collective Bargaining Agreement which was ratified in December 2012.All-in cash costs per ounce produced pre-tax were $1,359 in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $2,934 in the same quarter of 2012. The decrease is due to both higher production and a reduction in growth capital spending. During the comparative period in 2012 Kumtor expanded the mining fleet at a cost of $77.1 million or $1,270 per ounce produced. The impact of the expanded mining fleet in 2012 was partially offset by lower operating costs and capitalized stripping as the operating time in 2012 was reduced by ten days due to the work stoppage.Including revenue-based taxes, Kumtor's all-in cash costs per ounce produced for the first quarter of 2013 was $1,591 compared to $3,183 in the comparative quarter of 2012. All-in cash cost per ounce produced is a non-GAAP measure and is discussed under "Non-GAAP Measures".Exploration expenditures totaled $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2013, compared to $2.2 million reported in the first quarter 2012.Capital expenditures spent and accrued in the first quarter of 2013 at Kumtor amounted to $102.2 million which includes $11.7 million of sustaining capital, $16.1 million invested in growth capital primarily for the fleet expansion ($13 million) and $74.3 million for capitalized stripping. Capital expenditures in the comparative quarter of 2012 totaled $126.2 million, consisting of $5.5 million of sustaining capital and $120.7 million of growth capital including $33.4 million of capitalized stripping.Boroo/GatsuurtAt the Boroo mine in Mongolia, gold production was 25,602 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 11,848 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2012. The gold production increase of 13,754 ounces was mainly due to the resumption of activities at the heap leach operation, which contributed 10,372 ounces, and the processing of higher grades of ore through the mill, which contributed 15,230 ounces, partially offset by lower recoveries in 2013. Mill head grades averaged 1.54 g/t with a recovery of 54% in 2013, compared to 0.77 g/t with a recovery of 79% in the first quarter of 2012.The Boroo mill processed stockpiled ore in the first quarter of 2013 which was refractory in nature, resulting in lower recoveries (54% compared to 79.2%) than during the same period of 2012 when the mill processed non-refractory lower grade ore.Operating cash costs at Boroo (see "Non-GAAP Measures") increased by $3 million in the first three months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to the $2.5 million of costs associated with the heap leach operations which re-commenced in October 2012, as well as increased production taxes and royalties as a result of higher gold sales revenues.Operating cash costs per ounce produced in the first quarter of 2013 was $535 compared to $905 per ounce in the same period of 2012. The decrease of 41% was a result of a 116% increase in production partially offset by higher operating costs resulting primarily by the resumption of heap leaching operations. Total operating cash costs per ounce produced is a non-GAAP measure and is discussed under "Non-GAAP Measures".Boroo's all-in cash costs per ounce produced (pre-tax) for the first quarter of 2013 was $582 and included all costs directly related to gold production except for income tax paid in Mongolia. The same all-in cash costs measure for the first quarter of 2012 was $1,179 per ounce produced. The decrease in the all-in cash costs was primarily the result of the increase in production, reflecting the resumption of heap leaching operations and no mining activity in the first quarter of 2013. In the comparative quarter of 2012, mining costs accounted for $234 per ounce produced.Including income tax, Boroo's all-in cash costs per ounce produced for the first quarter of 2013 was $782 compared to $1,311 in the comparative quarter of 2012. All-in cash cost per ounce produced is a non-GAAP measure and is discussed under "Non-GAAP Measures".During the first quarter of 2013, exploration expenditures in Mongolia were $1 million down from $2.1 million in the same period of 2012.Capital expenditures spent and accrued at Boroo in the first quarter of 2013 decreased to $1.2 million compared to $3.7 million in the same period of 2012. 2013 capital primarily relates to tailings dam construction ($0.3 million) and mobile component change outs ($0.4 million), whereas in the first quarter of 2012, $3.3 million was related to capitalized stripping of Pit 6.The Gatsuurt project remained under care and maintenance in the first quarter of 2013 due to continued delays in permitting resulting from the Water and Forest Law which prohibits mining and exploration activities in water basin and forested areas. Further development of the project is subject to resolution of the impact of the Water and Forest Law on the Gatsuurt project, and receiving all required approvals and regulatory commissioning from the Mongolian Government.

Drilling focused on infilling portions of the SB Zone inferred resource below the planned KS-13 pit bottom on Sections 18, 30 and 38, and on extending the limits of the "Hockey Stick" Zone on Sections -42, -46 and -50.Three holes were drilled to infill the SB Zone inferred underground resource on Sections 30, 18 and 38, respectively. All three holes intersected broad zones of mineralization below the KS-13 pit design. D1695 intersected mineralization on Section 30 approximately 200 metres below the bottom of the KS-13 pit design. Better results include:D16954.7 g/t gold over 15.8 metres and 3.3 g/t gold over 48.9 metresD16964.3 g/t gold over 58.3 metres (including 14.6 g/t gold over 6.6 metres)D16983.5 g/t gold over 55.8 metresThree holes were drilled on Section -42 in the "Hockey Stick" Zone, a separate ore zone west of the SB Zone. D1702 intersected 7.9 g/t gold over 20.4 metres, including 18.8 g/t gold over 5.6 metres, approximately 50 metres below the KS13 pit design. D1707 encountered 4.4 g/t gold over 24.7 metres approximately fifty metres down dip from D1702, and D1710 intersected 5.3 g/t gold over 45.1 metres, including 12.0 g/t gold over 5 metres at the base of the KS-13 pit design.Further west on Section -46, D1700 intersected 1.7 g/t gold over 14.3 metres and 4.8 g/t gold over 5.8 metres near the bottom of the KS-13 pit design. Forty metres down dip and below the pit design, D1704 intersected 3.6 g/t gold over 9.3 metres, 2.0 g/t gold over 10.7 metres, 9.8 g/t gold over 5.5 metres, and 4.6 g/t gold over 3.3 metres. Eighty metres further down dip, D1711 intersected 2.9 g/t gold over 26 metres.Four holes were completed on Section -50, the western limit of drilling from within the Central Pit. D1699 returned 3.0 g/t gold over 6.9 metres and 11.2 g/t gold over 3.1 metres at the bottom of the KS-13 pit design. Approximately forty metres below the pit design, D1703 intersected 2.4 g/t gold over 11.2 metres, 1.9 g/t gold over 7.8 metres and 2.3 g/t gold over 5 metres. Fifty metres further down dip, D1705 returned several intercepts of 1-2 g/t gold over drilled intervals of 3 to 13 metres. D1709 intersected 7.0 g/t gold over 11.1 metres approximately 150 metres below the KS-13 pit bottom.The infill drilling of the SB Zone inferred underground resource will not materially impact the current resource estimate. Results from the Hockey Stick Zone on Sections -42, -46 and -50 extend the known limits of mineralization and will have a modest positive impact on future resource estimates.True widths for the mineralized zones are typically from 70% to 95% of the stated intercept.A complete listing of the drill results and supporting maps for the Kumtor pit have been filed on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ('SEDAR') at www.sedar.com and are available at the Company's web site at: www.centerragold.com.TurkeyÖksüt ProjectNine drill holes were completed before shutting down the drill program in early February due to winter weather conditions. Seven of the nine holes were completed at Ortaçam North to infill wide- spaced drilling, and two holes were drilled at the smaller Ortaçam deposit. Better results received during the quarter include:ODD95 (infill):0.9 g/t gold over 82.4 metresODD97 (infill):1.2 g/t gold over 259.0 metresODD98 (infill):1.0 g/t gold over 150.8 metresODD99 (Ortaçam):1.4 g/t gold over 39.0 metres and 2.2 g/t gold over 12.6 metres (EOH)ODD100 (infill):2.4 g/t gold over 176.0 metresODD101 (infill):0.5 g/t gold over 78.0 metres (EOH)ODD102 (infill):0.6 g/t gold over 128.0 metresODD103 (infill):0.8 g/t gold over 51.0 metres and 0.8 g/t gold over 68.0 metresODD104 (infill):1.4 g/t gold over 10.7 metres and 0.7 g/t gold over 66.0 metresThe infill drilling at the Ortaçam North and Ortaçam deposits agree well with the Öksüt resource model developed at year-end 2012 and announced in February 2013.Drilling will resume next quarter with a program of metallurgical holes to provide material for more column leach test work, as well as a program to test the eastern and southern limits of the Ortaçam North deposit and the eastern limits of the Ortaçam deposit. Work will also focus on converting inferred material to measured and indicated categories. Exploration drilling is also planned for other targets on the Öksüt licenses.True widths for the mineralized zones are from 50% to 90% of the stated intercept.A complete listing of the drill results and supporting maps for the Öksüt project have been filed on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ('SEDAR') at www.sedar.com and are available at the Company's web site at: www.centerragold.com.RussiaKara Beldyr Joint VentureEleven drill holes were completed during the quarter to infill portions of the Camp Zone. A single hole was also completed at the Camp Zone NE target located 600 metres northeast of Camp Zone. Better results received during the quarter include:KB-1671.5 g/t gold over 4.5 metres 1.9 g/t gold over 3.8 metres 2.7 g/t gold over 6.3 metresKB-1681.7 g/t gold over 9.6 metres 4.7 g/t gold over 2 metres 8.9 g/t gold over 1.1 metresKB-1691.7 g/t gold over 8.2 metres 10.2 g/t gold over 2.0 metresKB-170:4.6 g/t gold over 1.0 metres 22.5 g/t gold over 1.0 metresKB-171:6.9 g/t gold over 3.9 metres, including 15.1 g/t gold over 1.0 metresKB-172:3.4 g/t gold over 8.0 metresKB-175:6.9 g/t gold over 3.4 metres including 14.7 g/t gold over 1.0 metresThese results demonstrate continuity between wider-spaced drilling. Drilling will cease at Kara Beldyr early next quarter following completion of two additional holes at Camp Zone NE.True widths for the mineralized zones are from 20% to 90% of the stated intercept.A complete listing of the drill results and supporting maps for the Kara Beldyr project have been filed on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ('SEDAR') at www.sedar.com and are available at the Company's web site at: www.centerragold.com.To view the graphics, maps/drill sections and complete drill results discussed in this news release, please visit the following link: http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/Q1-2013_CG_exploration.pdf or visit the Company's web site at: www.centerragold.com.Qualified Person & QA/QCThe exploration information and related scientific and technical information in this news release were prepared in accordance with the standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum and National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101") and were prepared, reviewed, verified and compiled by Centerra's geological and mining staff under the supervision of David Groves, Certified Professional Geologist, Centerra's Vice-President, Global Exploration, who is the qualified person for the purpose of NI 43-101.

In particular, the following developments occurred in the Kyrgyz Republic, which will be discussed in greater detail below:On February 21, 2013, the Parliament adopted Resolution #2805 ("Resolution #2805"), which among other things, recommends that the Government ensure the continuous operation of the Kumtor mine, and within three months of the date of the resolution, conduct negotiations with Centerra with a view to revising the Kumtor Project Agreements to return to conditions that existed prior to the restructuring of the project in 2003, but subject to the application of the current Kyrgyz legislation, and to enter into new agreements. The resolution calls on the Government to report back to Parliament by June 1, 2013 on the implementation of the instructions set out in Resolution #2805;Kumtor received on February 21, 2013, a claim from the State Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry ("SAEPF") relating to alleged environmental damages at the Kumtor Project for an amount of approximately $315 million. This claim is in addition to the claims received by Kumtor in December 2012 for an aggregate amount of approximately $152 million (described in the Company's news releases dated December 14, 2012 and February 20, 2013);On March 12, 2013, the Government adopted decree #127 ("Decree #127") to implement the instructions set out in the Parliamentary Resolution #2805. Decree #127, among other things, establishes an advisory council for conducting consultations and negotiations with Centerra on the Kumtor Project to find mutually acceptable solutions on further implementation of the Kumtor Project;On April 9, 2013, an initiative group chaired by Mr. Beknazarov A.A. submitted a draft law (the "Law on Denunciation") for consideration by Parliament. The draft law "denounces" the Agreement on New Terms for the Kumtor Project ("ANT") entered into on April 24, 2009, and recognizes as invalid all other agreements associated with the ANT, and calls for the Government to bring all of its decisions in accordance with the Law on Denunciation. As of May 8, 2013, the Law on Denunciation has not been considered by Parliament. Based on Kyrgyz media reports, an opposition party in the Parliament, the Respublika faction, has endorsed the Law on Denunciation;The previously disclosed dispute with the Kyrgyz Republic Social Fund (the "Social Fund") regarding the Social Fund's efforts to invalidate previously issued acts (assessments) on Kumtor for the years 2004-2009 (see Company's news release of August 1, 2012) was heard by the Kyrgyz Republic Supreme Court in May 2013. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal by the Social Fund and upheld the decision of the lower courts; andOn May 3, 2013, the Company announced that a large section of Kumtor's principal waste-rock dump, the Davidov Valley Waste-rock Dump (Central Valley Waste Dump), was experiencing a greater than anticipated rate of movement, requiring the Company to accelerate the planned demolition of the buildings and relocation of certain other infrastructure and to develop an alternative long-term waste-rock dumping plan for approval by relevant Kyrgyz Republic authorities.The Company addresses these developments in detail below. Reference should also be made to the historical information contained in the Company's Annual Information Form for the year-ended December 31, 2012 (the "2012 Annual Information Form"). The Company believes that the Kumtor Project Agreements are legal, valid and enforceable obligations. The Kumtor Project Agreements were reviewed and approved by the Government and the Parliament, and were the subject of a positive decision of the Kyrgyz Republic Constitutional Court and a legal opinion by the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Justice. The Company has been in discussions with the Government with the objective of resolving these outstanding concerns through constructive dialogue. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully resolve any or all of these matters currently affecting the Kumtor Project. There can also be no assurance that the Government and/or Parliament will not take actions that are inconsistent with the Kyrgyz Republic's obligations under the Kumtor Project Agreements or cancel government decrees, orders or licenses under which Kumtor currently operates. Any such actions could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition. See "Material Assumptions & Risks" and "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Information" below. For further information on risk factors relevant to Centerra and its operations, please see "Risk Factors" in the 2012 Annual Information Form.Parliamentary Resolution #2805In connection with its consideration of the report from the State Commission established to inspect and review Kumtor's compliance with Kyrgyz operational and environmental laws and regulations and community standards, the Parliament adopted Resolution #2805 ("Resolution #2805") on February 21, 2013 regarding the Kumtor Project. The resolution recommends that the Government ensure the continuous operation of the Kumtor mine, and within three months of the date of the resolution, conduct negotiations with Centerra with a view to revising the Kumtor Project Agreements to return to conditions that existed prior to the restructuring of the project in 2003, but subject to the application of current Kyrgyz legislation, and to enter into new agreements on these terms. Resolution #2805 also provides recommendations and orders to the Kyrgyz Republic General Prosecutor's Office and the Kyrgyz Republic National Security Committee (as further discussed below). The resolution set a deadline of June 1, 2013 for the Government, the Kyrgyz Republic General Prosecutor's Office and the Kyrgyz Republic National Security Committee to provide Parliament with information related to the implementation of the State Commission's recommendations and Resolution #2805.Resolution #2805 states that if the parties cannot agree on mutually acceptable terms within such three month time period, the Government shall take certain actions with respect to the Kumtor Project, including among other things, to:invalidate the legislation enacted by Parliament in 2009 approving the Kumtor Project Agreements, and to unilaterally terminate the Kumtor Project Agreements;invalidate the legislation enacted by Parliament in 2009 amending the Kyrgyz Republic Tax Code (which provides for the tax regime set out in the Kumtor Project Agreements);confiscate land plots in connection with the adoption of Government Decree, "On abolition of the Government Decree on allocation of lands to the Kumtor Gold Company CJSC dated March 25, 2010", approved by the Government Decree dated July 5, 2012. (This March 25, 2010 Decree granted Kumtor surface rights in relation to the Kumtor Project. See Centerra's news release dated July 6, 2012.); andauthorize the State Inspectorate Office for Environmental and Technical Safety ("SIETS") to take measures to have Kumtor Operating Company pay fines and other charges for violations of environmental, mining and geological and subsoil legislation. (See Centerra's news releases dated December 14, 2012 and February 21, 2013 for information on significant claims received from SIETS on alleged environmental violations for an aggregate total of approximately $467 million.)In Resolution #2805, Parliament also requests that the Government develop and submit to Parliament for consideration certain matters, including the following:draft amendments to existing legislation or draft new legislation relating to biosphere territories, the protection and preservation of glaciers, and prohibiting the placement of pollutants on glaciers;provide for the obligation of Kumtor to develop a technical plan on reclamation of the Kumtor Project in accordance with Kyrgyz legislation and to determine funding for reclamation based on such plan and to enforce this obligation;for the entire period of the Kumtor Project, to invoice Kumtor for the use of water and make Kumtor pay for changes in the glacial regime and disposal of waste; andwhen negotiating with Centerra and Kumtor Operating Company, to require that goods and services be purchased for the Kumtor Project in the domestic market.The resolution instructs the General Prosecutor's Office and the National Security Committee to investigate allegations that Kumtor deliberately understated reserves, including silver and tellurium.Additional Environmental ClaimAs previously disclosed, Centerra's operating subsidiary, Kumtor Operating Company CJSC, received on February 21, 2013, a claim from the State Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry ("SAEF") relating to alleged environmental damages at the Kumtor Project. This claim is in addition to the five environmental claims that Kumtor received in December 2012 for an aggregate amount of $152 million (see the Company's news releases dated December 14, 2012 and February 20, 2013 for information on these five claims). The claim issued by SAEF is for approximately $315 million for alleged damage in relation to waste placed in the tailings management facility, waste rock dumps, and for the generation, management and treatment of other types of wastes. The claim covers the period from 1996 to 2011. Similar to the five claims received by the Kumtor Project in December 2012, the claim by SAEF references the review of the Kumtor Project carried out by the environmental and technical working group of the Kyrgyz Republic State Commission.The Company is studying the claim but believes that the allegations contained in the claim are exaggerated or without merit. Centerra's Kumtor Project complies with Kyrgyz Republic laws on environmental, safety and health standards. The Kumtor Project has been the subject of systematic audits and investigations over many years by Kyrgyz and international experts. In particular, in August 2012, the Safety, Health and Environment Committee of the Board of Directors of Centerra engaged an independent internationally recognized consultant to carry out a due diligence review of Kumtor's performance on safety, health and environmental matters. The report issued in October 2012 concluded that "no major or materially significant environmental issues were identified" at Kumtor. The review focused on numerous environmental areas, including waste management and environmental management systems. The report can be found on the Kumtor website at http://www.kumtor.kg/en/ under the "Environment" section (under "Reports").The Company notes that the Kumtor Project Agreements provide a complete listing of all taxes and payments to be made to the Government, including a fixed environmental charge. Accordingly, no other tax, duties, or other obligations are to be paid to the Kyrgyz Republic, however they may be characterized. Centerra also notes that, as part of the Kumtor Project Agreements signed in 2009, Centerra, Kumtor and the Government, among other parties, entered into a release agreement on June 6, 2009 (the "Release Agreement"). Pursuant to the Release Agreement, the parties agreed to release each other from any claims, including any legal, tax and fiscal matter, in respect of any matter arising or existing prior to June 6, 2009, whether such matters were known or unknown as of June 6, 2009, subject to certain exemptions which are not applicable in the circumstances, including an exemption for "unknown environmental damage" as defined in the ANT.Government Decree #127In order to implement Resolution #2805, the Government adopted Decree #127 on March 12, 2013 ("Decree #127"). Decree #127, among other things, establishes an advisory council for conducting consultations and negotiations with Centerra on the Kumtor Project to find mutually acceptable solutions on further implementation of the Kumtor Project. The advisory council is comprised of Government officials, including the Prime Minister Satybaldiev.Decree #127 also instructed various Government ministries to take actions with respect to the Kumtor Project, including compiling an inventory of Government decisions issued from 1992 to 2012 providing allotment of land parcels for the Kumtor Project, and ensuring "efficiency of management" of shares in Centerra held by Kyrgyzaltyn JSC ("Kyrgyzaltyn"). Kyrgyzaltyn is also permitted to engage international legal and financial services firms to represent the Government interests during consultations and negotiations with Centerra.Draft Law to Invalidate the Kumtor Project AgreementsOn April 9, 2013, an initiative group chaired by Mr. Beknazarov A.A. submitted the Law on Denunciation for consideration by Parliament. The draft law "denounces" the Agreement on New Terms for the Kumtor Project ("ANT") entered on April 24, 2009, and recognizes as invalid all other agreements associated with the ANT, and calls for the Government to bring all of its decisions in accordance with the Law on Denunciation. As of May 8, 2013, the Law on Denunciation has not been considered by Parliament. Based on Kyrgyz media reports, the Respublika faction, an opposition party in the Parliament has endorsed the Law on Denunciation.Kyrgyz Republic Social Fund DisputeAs previously disclosed, the Social Fund commenced a claim in the Kyrgyz courts to invalidate documentary acts (assessments) issued by the Social Fund for the years 2004-2009. The claim was commenced by the Social Fund in late 2012. The matter was argued before the Bishkek Interdistrict court on procedural matters in August 2012, which resulted in the matter being dismissed. The dismissal was subsequently appealed by the Social Fund and argued before the Bishkek City Court in November 2012, where the Social Fund claims were again dismissed. The Social Fund appealed the decision of the Bishkek City Court to the Kyrgyz Republic Supreme Court which heard the matter in March 2013. The Supreme Court dismissed the Social Fund's appeal and upheld the decision of the lower court.For a further discussion regarding the Social Fund claim and the dispute for the 2010 taxation year regarding the payment of Social Fund contributions on the high altitude coefficient, please see the 2012 Annual Information Form.MongoliaCenterra continues to be in discussions with the Mongolian Government regarding the development of the Gatsuurt property. Centerra remains reasonably confident that the economic and development benefits resulting from its exploration and development activities will ultimately result in the Mongolian Water and Forest Law having a limited impact on the Gatsuurt project, in particular, and other of the Company's Mongolian activities, including the ATO deposit. As previously disclosed, the Mongolian Water and Forest Law prohibits mineral prospecting, exploration and mining in water basins and forestry areas in Mongolia.There can be no assurance, however, that the Mongolian Water and Forest Law will have a minimal impact on Centerra's Mongolian operations. Unless the Water and Forest Law is repealed or amended such that the law no longer applies to the Gatsuurt project or Gatsuurt is designated as a "mineral deposit of strategic importance" that is exempt from the Water and Forest Law, mineral reserves at Gatsuurt may have to be reclassified as mineral resources or eliminated entirely and the Company may be required to write-off the associated investment in Gatsuurt and Boroo (where Gatsuurt ore was planned to be milled).Corporate The claim commenced in March 2011 by a Turkish company, Sistem Muhenkislik Insaat Sanayi Ticaret SA ("Sistem") which alleges that the shares in Centerra owned by Kyrgyzaltyn are, in fact, legally and beneficially owned the Kyrgyz Republic continues to be subject to proceedings in the Ontario courts. Centerra is not a party to the proceedings, but understands that the matter is being scheduled for consideration on its merits.Centerra continues to be subject to an Ontario court decision dated September 5, 2012 as amended November 23, 2012 (the "Court Order") whereby Centerra is required to hold in trust, to the credit of the Sistem court proceeding, Kyrgyzaltyn's portion of dividends payable on shares of Centerra, up to a maximum of Cdn$11.2 million. The Court Order is effective until the resolution of the court proceedings. As of April 30, 2013, Centerra holds in trust Cdn$8.8 million of dividend payments, and Cdn$27 thousand in interest income. The Court Order also places certain restrictions on 4 million of the Centerra shares held by Kyrgyzaltyn, including restrictions on the transfer or encumbrance of such shares. The Centerra shares pledged by Kyrgyzaltyn to Kumtor Gold Company and Kumtor Operating Company as security for payments due from Kyrgyzaltyn under the Restated Gold and Silver Sale Agreement dated as of June 6, 2009 are not subject to the Court Order. For a further discussion regarding the Sistem court matter and the Court Order, please see the 2012 Annual Information Form.For a full discussion of risk factors that could have a material effect on the profitability, future cash flow, earnings, results of operations, stated mineral reserves or financial conditions of the Company, please see "Risk Factors" in the 2012 Annual Information Form available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and see also the discussion below under the heading "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Information".2013 OutlookThe Company is monitoring the recent fluctuations in the gold price and assessing their impact on its operations. The Company is in the process of reviewing its spending plans for 2013, which may result in a delay of some capital expenditures to future years and a reduction of planned expenditures for some discretionary spending including exploration, business development, and community investments.Centerra's 2013 gold production and operating cash costs are unchanged from the previous guidance disclosed in the Company's news release of February 20, 2013. The forecast for the all-in cash costs unit measure has been revised as explained below. The new ranges are as follows:  2013 Production Forecast 2013 Operating Cash Costs(1) 2013 All-in Cash Cost (pre-tax)(2)  (ounces of gold) ($ per ounce produced) ($ per ounce produced)Kumtor 550,000 - 600,000 $342 - 373 $853 - 931Boroo 55,000 - 60,000 $1,055 - 1,151 $1,225 - 1,336Consolidated 605,000 - 660,000 $406- 443 $1,053- 1,149(1)Operating cash costs per ounce produced is a non-GAAP measure and includes mine operating costs such as mining, processing, regional office administration, royalties and production taxes (except at Kumtor where revenue-based taxes are excluded), but excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, reclamation costs, financing costs, capital investments, community investments, exploration expenses and corporate general and administration expenses.(2)All-in cash costs (pre-tax) per ounce produced is a non-GAAP measure and includes operating cash costs, sustaining and growth capital, corporate general and administrative expenses, global exploration expenses, and community investments, but excludes revenue-based taxes at Kumtor and income taxes.2013 ProductionCenterra's 2013 consolidated gold production is forecast to be in the 605,000 to 660,000 ounce range, which is unchanged from the previous guidance.In 2013, approximately 55% of Kumtor's gold production is expected to occur in the fourth quarter creating a potential variability to Kumtor's 2013 production guidance. Centerra estimates that the Kumtor mine will produce between 550,000 and 600,000 ounces in 2013, which is unchanged from the previous guidance. Ore production in the fourth quarter is planned to come from the high-grade SB Zone ore that has several years of production history. The high-grade ore from the SB Zone is only available for mining at the end of the third quarter when it is exposed by Cut Back 15.At the Boroo mine, gold production is forecast to be approximately 55,000 to 60,000 ounces, which is unchanged from the previous guidance. The Boroo production includes about 24,000 ounces from heap leaching and 36,000 ounces from processing mill stockpiles. The Boroo mill is expected to process ore stockpiles during the year with an average grade of 0.90 g/t. The 2013 forecast assumes no mining activities at Boroo and Gatsuurt, and no gold production from Gatsuurt.2013 All-in Unit Cash Costs:Centerra's 2013 all-in cash costs (pre-tax) per ounce before revenue-based tax at Kumtor and current income tax at Boroo has been revised from the previous guidance disclosed in the Company's news release of February 20, 2013 to a range of $1,053 to $1,149 per ounce, due to the Company reducing its planned exploration expenditures form $45 million to $40 million. The Company has also revised its estimates of revenue-based tax at Kumtor and current income tax at Boroo due to a lower gold price assumption forecasted for the last three quarters of 2013 from $1,700 per ounce sold to $1,450 per ounce sold. Based on its revised estimates, the Company is forecasting all-in unit production costs as follows:  Kumtor Boroo Consolidated  $ per ounce produced $ per ounce produced $ per ounce producedOperating cash costs1 $342 - 373 $1,055 - 1,151 $406 - 443Capitalized stripping costs - cash  354 - 386  -  322 - 351Operating cash and stripping costs $696 - 759 $1,055 - 1,151 $728 - 794Sustaining capital (cash)  105 - 115  170 - 185  113 - 124Growth capital (cash)  52 - 57  -  49 - 53Operating cash costs including capital $853 - 931 $1,225 - 1,336 $890 - 971          Corporate and other cash costs2  -  -  163 - 178All-in cash costs (pre-tax)1 $853 - 931 $1,225 - 1,336 $1,053 - 1,149          Revenue-based tax and income tax3 $203 - 222 $96 - 105 $194 - 211          Total all-in cash cost including taxes1, 3 $1,056 - 1,153 $1,321 - 1,441 $1,247 - 1,360Operating cash costs, all-in cash costs (pre-tax) and total all-in cash costs including taxes per ounce produced are non-GAAP measures and are discussed under "Non-GAAP Measures".Corporate and other cash costs per ounce produced include corporate general and administrative expenses, global exploration expenses, and community investments.Revenue-based tax and income tax are calculated on ounces sold and reflect actuals for the first quarter 2013 and a gold price assumption of $1,450 per ounce for the last three quarters of 2013.2013 Exploration Expenditures:Exploration expenditures of approximately $40 million are now planned for 2013, a decrease of $5 million from earlier forecasts. All of the decrease will occur at Kumtor, where limited pit access due to mining activity will result in decreased drilling activity for the year. Exploration expenditures at Kumtor are now estimated at $8.5 million, a decrease of $5.0 million from the original 2013 budget.In Mongolia, approximately $6.8 million is allocated for exploration programs at the Altan Tsagaan Ovoo ("ATO") project and in the greater ATO district.Exploration spending in Turkey will increase to approximately $9 million as work focuses on expanding and upgrading the Öksüt gold deposit resource, advancing on-going metallurgical testwork and initiating detailed environmental and technical project studies.
