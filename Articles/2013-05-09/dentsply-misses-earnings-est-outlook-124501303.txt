Guidance
Based on the current global dental market trends along with the impact of currency rates, DENTSPLY lowered its adjusted earnings per share expectation to the band of $2.33 and $2.43 (earlier $2.38 and $2.48) for 2013. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 earnings is pegged at $2.42.
Our Take
We remain unimpressed by DENTSPLY’s flat bottom-line and declining gross margin in the first quarter. Difficult global dental market trends have led to the soft results as well as reduced guidance for 2013.
However, the record revenues demonstrate that the company is poised to grow its share in the dental consumable market, driven by a strong product base and significant investment in product/technology innovation.
