The volume was well above the strike's open interest of 310 contracts before the session began, indicating that these are new positions.EXEL rose 7.41 percent to close the session at $4.93, a penny off the session high. Shares had fallen sharply from a high of $5.30 last week but bounced back above several key moving averages yesterday. After Tuesday's close, the cancer-drug developer reported a narrower-than-expected loss and revenues that exceeded analysts' forecasts. Yesterday's long calls are looking for EXEL to gain roughly 6.5 percent to 8.5 percent by mid-June. These options lock in the price where traders can buy the stock no matter how far it might climb, but they will expire worthless if shares remain below the $5 strike price.
