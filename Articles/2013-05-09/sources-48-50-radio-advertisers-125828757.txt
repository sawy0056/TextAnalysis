Rush LimbaughMoreAPGood morning, AdLand. Here's what you need to know today:A high ranking source at Cumulus radio told the Radio Ink that 48 out of 50 advertisers gave orders to exclude "Rush and Hannity" from their packages. Of course the radio company that distributes Limbaugh's show released a statement that the claim is "completely inaccurate."
