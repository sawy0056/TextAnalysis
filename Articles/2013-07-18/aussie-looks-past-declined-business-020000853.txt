THE TAKEAWAY: Survey shows drop in Australian business confidence > Market look towards Bernanke and G20 > AUD/USD FlatThe Australian Dollar remained relatively flat against the US Dollar as Australian business confidence declined in the second quarter. The NAB index printed -1 from last quarter’s 2 and could be a sign for deteriorating sentiment. Data released from China showed continued increases in June property prices, which could be a reflection of sustained economic activity. That may boost the demand outlook for Australian exporters.
