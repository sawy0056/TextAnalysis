As people tweeted disappointment, Lambda Labs replied:@jnparis @allthingsd @lizgannes Don't worry, we think it's a core feature. Google will allow it or be replaced with something that does.— Lambda Labs (@LambdaAPI) June 1, 2013We reached out to Balaban for comment and will share more details on this project when we get them.More From Business Insider Motorola's Next Smartphone Will Be Able To Listen To You Even If The Screen Is Switched OffGoogle Delays Construction Of Its Massive New Headquarters10 Things 'Back To The Future 2' Got Right About Today's Tech
