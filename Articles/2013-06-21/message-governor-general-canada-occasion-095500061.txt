OTTAWA, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Jun 21, 2013) -
On the occasion of National Aboriginal Day, we celebrate the contributions of First Nations, Inuit and Métis people that are deeply embedded in our culture and our way of life.This culture and history deserve to be appreciated in their own right. Yet, if we are to ascribe one all-embracing quality to Aboriginal peoples, let it be the following: that against incredible adversity, Canada's Aboriginal peoples have always persevered-and still do-in keeping their distinctive cultures alive.All across the country, members of Inuit, Métis and First Nations communities are devising new and innovative ways to achieve success and prosperity, and in so doing make life better for their people and for all Canadians. On this occasion, I am participating in the Summer Solstice Aboriginal Arts Festival's Education Day in Ottawa, while Sharon is visiting with Aboriginal youth in Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug, in northwestern Ontario.On this celebration day, we invite each of you to recognize the many contributions of Aboriginal peoples to Canada, both in the past and present. And where tension and conflict remain, let us work towards mending heavy hearts, so that-to borrow a turn of phrase from the late Chief Dan George-they may yet soar again.
