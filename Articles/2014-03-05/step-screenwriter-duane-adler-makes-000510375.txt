Adler is a key contributor to the reemergence of the enormous appeal of music and dance in American popular culture. Adler's original screenplays for Save The Last Dance and Step Up both pre-figure the Dancing With The Stars craze and arguably established the careers of then-newcomers Julia Stiles, Kerry Washington and Channing Tatum.MAKE YOUR MOVE, a Romeo & Juliet-esque tale of Donny, an American dancer from New Orleans who's a some-time bad boy, and Aya, a spunky, sultry Asian taiko drummer, stars Dancing With The Stars' Derek Hough and multiplatinum-selling K-Pop star BoA.Set in Brooklyn in the underground dance club scene, MAKE YOUR MOVE not only features some supercharged, mesmerizing dance-off and drumming set pieces, it also engages the audience with its diverse, multicultural cast. Both Save The Last Dance and the Step Up films have diverse casts and transcend culture, race and economic class, common threads in all Adler's work."Our story is set in Brooklyn, one of the most ethnically diverse cities and neighborhoods in the world. I wanted the film to reflect that. The diversity of our cast feels very 'today', especially as our world has shrunk on a global scale; young people are exposed to so much cultural range, in the classroom, in their daily lives and via the internet," comments Adler.FOR INTERVIEWS, PLEASE CONTACT RITA HOLLINGSWORTH/RMH MEDIA: (323) 934-9348 OR RITA@RMHMEDIA.NET
