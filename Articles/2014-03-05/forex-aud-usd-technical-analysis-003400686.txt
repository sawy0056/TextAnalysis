Support: 0.8919 (14.6% Fib exp.), 0.8821 (23.6% Fib exp.)
Resistance: 0.9051-85 (Jan 13 close and high) We entered short AUD/USDafter prices put in a bearish Evening Star candle formation, suggestingthe currency may be carving out a top in the 0.9051-85 area (marked by the January 13 closing and swing highs). The emergence of negative RSI divergence bolsters the case for further weakness.Prices descended to our initial target at 0.8919, the 14.6% Fibonacci expansion, but have since stalled. A series of back-to-back indecision candles warns a bounce may be ahead but the overall structure of the short-term down trend remains intact. We will remain short for now, initially looking for a daily close below 0.8919to expose the 23.6% level at 0.8821. A stop-loss will be activated on a close above 0.9085.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
