* Rupiah near 4-1/2-yr low on corp dollar demand* Won slides on intervention caution, importers* Philippine peso turns lower on corp dlr bids(Adds text, updates prices)By Jongwoo CheonSept 11 (Reuters) - The Indonesian rupiah and the SouthKorean won led slides among emerging Asian currencies onWednesday as investors booked profits from gains in regionalunits and stock markets earlier in the week.The rupiah hovered near its weakest in 4-1/2 years onsustained dollar demand from local companies.The won fell on increasing caution over possibleintervention by the foreign exchange authorities.The Philippine peso and the Malaysian ringgit, which started the day firmer, also turned weaker.Earlier, most emerging Asian currencies advanced on signsthat the United States is moving away from taking militaryaction against Syria after a diplomatic initiative from Russia.But regional units came under pressure as 10-year U.S.Treasury note yield rose to 2.9718 in Asian trading.MSCI's broadest stock index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japanalso turned lower."Higher U.S. yields are not helping Asian currencies and wehave negative equity market sentiment throughout the region,"said Jonathan Cavenagh, a senior FX strategist at Westpac inSingapore."We could see more profit-taking but we need to see acatalyst for dollar/Asia to significantly move higher," Cavenaghsaid.Emerging Asian currencies could weaken much further if the10-year U.S. note yield rises above 3.00 percent, he added.Most regional units rose earlier this week as investorscovered short positions after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobsdata and solid Chinese economic indicators.RUPIAHSpot rupiah indicative prices lost as much as 2.3 percent to11,475 per dollar on corporate demand for the greenback. Thatcompared with 11,500, its weakest since April 2009, hit onTuesday.Forwards market pointed to more weakness with one-monthdeliverable forwards weakening to 11,560.Still, the Indonesian currency cut some of initial losses onequity-linked inflows and as 5- and 10-year bond yieldsfell.WONThe won slid as offshore funds and local importers boughtdollars after South Korea's foreign exchange authorities werespotted intervening on Tuesday to stem its upside.Foreign investors continued to buy Seoul stocks, buta lack of exporters' demand put pressure on the won, traderssaid."The 1,080 resistance is seen getting stronger and thatcaused more people to add dollar long positions, although itwould be a key if we see more stock inflows," said a foreignbank trader in Seoul, referring to the won's value against thedollar.RINGGITThe ringgit initially rose as investors continued to covershort positions.But it turned weaker on dollar demand from custodian banksand as it faces a chart resistance area around 3.2600 perdollar, traders said.Local importers also purchased the greenback for settlementsaround that level, according to traders."The resistance at 3.26 is pretty clear," said a seniorMalaysian bank trader in Kuala Lumpur, adding he would buy theringgit only when it strengthens past the line for a target of3.2400."I want to be long dollar going into FOMC next week," hesaid, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting onSept. 17-18.Meanwhile, the ringgit found some relief from data showingthe country's industrial output in July grew at its fastest pacesince May 2012.PHILIPPINE PESOThe peso started the local trade at a session high of 43.65per dollar, its strongest since Aug. 16.Investors covered short positions which they had built up onexpectations that the Philippine currency may have notstrengthen past 43.80, traders said.But the peso failed to stay on the black on dollar demandfrom local companies and as traders covered short positions inthe greenback."The peso might see some resistance at 43.60," said aforeign bank trader in Manila."With the FOMC next week, I don't think people would hold onto big dollar short positions."CURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLARChange on the day at 0450 GMTCurrency Latest bid Previous day Pct MoveJapan yen 100.48 100.38 -0.10Sing dlr 1.2700 1.2685 -0.12Taiwan dlr 29.769 29.760 -0.03Korean won 1087.90 1084.10 -0.35Baht 32.15 32.15 +0.00Peso 43.86 43.83 -0.07Rupiah 11475.00 11210.00 -2.31Rupee 64.10 63.84 -0.40Ringgit 3.2780 3.2770 -0.03Yuan 6.1199 6.1200 +0.00Change so far in 2013Currency Latest bid End prev year Pct MoveJapan yen 100.48 86.79 -13.62Sing dlr 1.2700 1.2219 -3.79Taiwan dlr 29.769 29.136 -2.13Korean won 1087.90 1070.60 -1.59Baht 32.15 30.61 -4.79Peso 43.86 41.05 -6.41Rupiah 11475.00 9630.00 -16.08Rupee 64.10 54.99 -14.21Ringgit 3.2780 3.0580 -6.71Yuan 6.1199 6.2303 +1.80(Additional reporting by KyoungHo Lee in SEOUL and IFR Markets'Catherine Tan; Editing by Kim Coghill)
