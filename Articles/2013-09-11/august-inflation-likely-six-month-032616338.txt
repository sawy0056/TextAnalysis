It has since clawed back some ground but most strategists in another Reuters poll do not expect much of a recovery over the coming year.That and a pick up in prices of crude oil last month pushed state-run oil marketing firms to hike retail prices of diesel and petrol, weighing on food inflation."An increase in transportation costs and shortages in supply of some key perishable items such as vegetables and onions probably pushed food prices higher," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.Food prices increased for a third month in a row through July, reflecting a more than 20 percent rise in vegetable and onion prices during that period.Any further acceleration in inflation will only add to the declining popularity of the Congress-led government ahead of elections early next year.A separate Reuters poll showed consumer inflation - scheduled to release on Thursday - probably eased to 9.55 percent year-over-over last month, only just below July's 9.64 percent.(Polling by Hari Kishan; Editing by Kim Coghill)
