Gross margins were the lowest since 2010.A decline in the order book of 6.7% and a weak consumer environment in the U.S. and Europe look to be generating headwinds to the outlook for sales and gross margin.Valuation:Valuation is not expensive at 12.4 times forward 12 month earnings, but the PEG ratio is 1.00 and over the 10 year median of 0.90.  Concerns over profit growth and margin erosion may justify a depressed looking PE ratio.Alternatives:Those looking for exposure to the apparel industry may want to think about Hansbrands (HBI) Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
