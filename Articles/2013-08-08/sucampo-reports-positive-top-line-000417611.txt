Sucampo Pharmaceuticals announced the positive top-line results of two recently completed clinical trials, a Phase 1a trial of cobiprostone and a Phase 1a trial of SPI-3608. Cobiprostone is being investigated for the prevention and/or treatment of oral mucositis. The Phase 1a clinical trial for the investigational oral spray formulation of cobiprostone demonstrated that the drug is generally well-tolerated in healthy volunteers. A Phase 1b trial is expected to begin in Q4. Sucampo also announced the positive top-line results of SPI-3608 in a Phase 1a single-oral-dose study that demonstrated the drug to be generally well tolerated in healthy volunteers. SPI-3608 is being investigated for the treatment of mild to moderate lumbar spinal stenosis and may be investigated for additional indications in the future. The next phase of development for SPI-3608 is expected to begin in 1Q14.
