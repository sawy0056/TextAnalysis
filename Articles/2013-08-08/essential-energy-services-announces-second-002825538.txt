1 Refer to "Non-IFRS Measures" section for further information.HIGHLIGHTS - SECOND QUARTER 2013Revenue for the second quarter of 2013 was $38.4 million, a decrease of $12.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2012.Coil Well Service - Essential's coil well service business experienced a decline in revenue relative to prior year due to abnormally wet conditions which extended spring break-up preventing equipment from returning to work. Deep coil tubing utilization was limited to 18% given the restrictions on moving heavy equipment due to road bans. In the comparative period of 2012, Essential also had two customer projects that did not recur in 2013. Service Rigs - Service rig revenue was relatively unchanged compared to prior year despite the wet conditions and the net addition of three service rigs to the fleet. Service rig utilization at 28% decreased from prior year. Demand continued for Essential's service rigs operating on steam-assisted gravity drainage ("SAGD") wells contributing to incremental revenue in 2013. Downhole Tools & Rentals - Revenue for downhole tools & rentals remained relatively flat during the second quarter of 2013 compared to prior year, performing well in a challenging industry environment in which drilling rig utilization decreased 18% quarter-over-quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter of 2013 was a loss of $5.2 million, a decrease of $5.1 million from 2012. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower utilization in the coil well service business and the greater impact on margins of operating costs incurred relative to revenue. Certain expenses associated with labour, maintaining equipment and service locations, infrastructure and administration have a fixed cost component, negatively impacting operating margins during periods of low activity. A portion of these operating costs normally incurred near the end of the first quarter were pushed into the second quarter of 2013 due to the extended winter season.Essential's capital program remains on target. During the second quarter, Essential commissioned one mobile free standing, all period double service rig which is SAGD capable. Essential also took delivery of two nitrogen pumpers in the second quarter.INDUSTRY OVERVIEWThe seasonal decline in activity associated with spring break-up was more pronounced in the second quarter of 2013 as activity in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin ("WCSB") was significantly below prior year levels. The second quarter of 2013 experienced particularly wet conditions due to melting of elevated snowpacks at the completion of the winter season and heavy rainfall throughout most of the second quarter. These factors impacted ground moisture, limiting access to well sites and delaying activity in June, when oilfield equipment typically returns to work.Drilling rig utilization, number of wells drilled and well completion count, all indicators of overall activity in the WCSB, were down quarter-over-quarter compared to prior year as persistent wet conditions limited access to well sites. Compared to the second quarter 2012, drilling rig utilization decreased 18%, the number of wells drilled decreased by 13% and well completion count decreased 20%.

Coil well service revenue decreased during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to persistent wet conditions in Alberta throughout most of the second quarter and the melting of heavy snowpacks at the end of the winter season. Deep coil tubing utilization, below prior year levels, shows a similar trend to the decline in industry drilling rig utilization and well completion count quarter-over-quarter. In the comparative period of 2012, Essential's coil well service revenue and deep coil tubing utilization also included two customer projects which accounted for more than half of the quarter-over-quarter revenue reduction. Revenue per hour for coil well service decreased from prior year due to a change in the mix of services provided.Service rig operations performed well during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the prior year despite unfavourable industry conditions which saw a 20% decrease in industry well completion activity. Production work opportunities were also adversely impacted by the wet conditions. Although wet conditions and lower activity negatively impacted many areas of the WCSB, revenue per hour in the second quarter of 2013 increased from prior year due to the mix of services provided, including an increase in SAGD revenue.Story continuesWell servicing revenue decreased on a year-to-date basis in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the disposal of the drilling rig operations in November 2012.Operating expenses were lower in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year mainly as a result of lower variable operating costs which fluctuate based on activity. During the second quarter of 2013, Essential continued to incur fixed operating costs associated with retaining key personnel and maintaining equipment and service locations. These costs tend to negatively impact operating margins during periods of low activity. In comparison to the second quarter of 2012, Essential absorbed higher repairs and maintenance costs as a result of the extended winter operating season in the first quarter of 2013 which delayed the start of its spring maintenance program until April 2013.Operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2013 were lower compared to the prior year as a result of lower variable operating costs which fluctuate based on activity.

From a revenue perspective, the downhole tools & rentals segment performed well during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year despite wet conditions which resulted in an 18% decrease in drilling rig utilization quarter-over-quarter. Revenue for the higher margin conventional tubular rentals business decreased quarter-over-quarter due to the decline in industry drilling rig activity.Downhole tools & rentals revenue increased on a year-to-date basis in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of first quarter Tryton Multi Stage Fracturing System ("Tryton MSFS") activity which was much stronger during the busy winter drilling season.Operating expenses increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis due in part to start-up costs related to the expansion of the downhole tools operations into the United States without any corresponding increase in revenue as the business is in the pre-operating phase.

General and administrative expenses are comprised of wages, professional fees, office space and other administrative costs incurred at the corporate and operation levels. General and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2013 were comparable to 2012, although as a percentage of revenue, expenses increased due to lower activity in the second quarter of 2013. Year-over-year general and administrative expenses were higher due to increased staffing, professional fees and infrastructure costs.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSEssential ceased operating activities in Colombia in early July 2013, with the conclusion of its final contractual obligations. During the second quarter of 2013, Essential re-assessed the estimated net realizable value of oilfield service equipment in Colombia, and a further $2.4 million loss on revaluation was taken. This loss reflects the deterioration in the Colombian oilfield services market. As of August 7, 2013, Essential has received $1.1 million in cash proceeds from the sales of Colombian assets to date.FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Essential's 2013 capital spending budget of $45 million is comprised of $32 million of growth (1) capital and $13 million of maintenance (1) capital. Capital spending remains on track for 2013.As previously disclosed, Essential has commitments to build three deep Generation III coil tubing rigs with a fabrication company that has been having significant issues meeting delivery deadlines. When Essential announced its 2013 capital budget, one of those deep coil tubing rigs was included in the delivery expectations for 2013 and two were not. The first rig is currently in the final stages of commissioning and is expected to be ready for work in September 2013. Unfortunately, the fabricator is still unable to provide firm delivery timing for the other two rigs. Deposits on these remaining two rigs are approximately $3.6 million. Essential continues to work with the fabricator to determine the outcome of these two rigs.The following table shows the expected in-service dates of the major equipment being built over the remainder of 2013:
Expected In-Service Date
Quantity 2013
Deep masted coil tubing rigs 4 Q3(1),Q4(3)
Deep coil tubing rig converted from intermediate 1 Q3
Double rod rig 1 Q3
Double service rigs - mobile free standing, all-period 2 Q3(2)
(one is SAGD capable)
OUTLOOKAfter a very slow second quarter, Canadian oilfield services demand has returned to levels normal for this time of year and similar to last year. With horizontal well development continuing to lead drilling activity, Essential expects to benefit from demand for its growing fleet of deep coil tubing rigs and its downhole tool business. There continues to be longer-term optimism with investment focused on the Montney, Horn River and the Duvernay natural gas basins to develop the reserves to provide gas to the proposed liquefied natural gas ("LNG") export facilities in British Columbia. Such development would increase the demand for Essential's oilfield services to complete these wells.The expansion of Essential's deep masted coil tubing fleet is on track with one deep masted coil tubing rig expected in service in the third quarter and three in the fourth quarter. These state-of-the-art deep rigs are well-suited for work in the Montney, Horn River and the Duvernay basins, which again are the primary gas basins to provide feedstock for the anticipated LNG export facilities.Essential is in the process of organically expanding its downhole tool operations into the United States. Pre-operating activities remain on track and operations are expected to commence in the third quarter.Essential has a very strong balance sheet with $29.1 million of debt outstanding on August 7, 2013 and debt to EBITDA of 0.4x. Early in 2012, Essential implemented a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per quarter. Reflecting the Company's financial strength and positive view of the future, the dividend has been increased by 20% to $0.03 per quarter, effective with the third quarter dividend, payable in October.The second quarter Management's Discussion and Analysis and Financial Statements are available on Essential's website at www.essentialenergy.ca and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.SUMMARY OF QUARTERLY DATA

(1)Non-IFRS MeasuresThroughout this press release, certain terms that are not specifically defined in IFRS are used to analyze Essential's operations. In addition to the primary measures of net earnings and net earnings per share in accordance with IFRS, Essential believes that certain measures not recognized under IFRS assist both Essential and the reader in assessing performance and understanding Essential's results. Each of these measures provides the reader with additional insight into Essential's ability to fund principal debt repayments and capital programs. As a result, the method of calculation may not be comparable with other companies. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net earnings and net earnings per share as calculated in accordance with IFRS.EBITDA (Earnings before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, transaction costs, non- controlling interest earnings, losses or gains on disposal of equipment, results of discontinued operations and share-based compensation) - This measure is considered an indicator of Essential's ability to generate funds flow in order to fund required working capital, service debt and fund capital programs.EBITDA % - This measure is considered an indicator of Essential's ability to generate funds flow as calculated by EBITDA divided by revenue.Funds flow or funds flow from operations - This measure is an indicator of Essential's ability to generate funds flow in order to fund working capital, principal debt repayments and capital programs. Funds flow or funds flow from operations is defined as cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash operating working capital. This measure is useful in assessing Essential's operational cash flow as it provides cash generated in the period excluding the timing of non-cash operating working capital. This reflects the ability of the operations of Essential to meet the above noted funding requirements.Working capital - Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.Growth capital - Growth capital is capital spending which is intended to result in incremental increases in revenue. Growth capital is considered to be a key measure as it represents the total expenditures on equipment expected to add incremental revenues and funds flow to Essential.Maintenance capital - Equipment additions that are incurred in order to refurbish or replace previously acquired equipment less proceeds on the disposal of retired equipment. Such additions do not provide incremental increases in revenue. Maintenance capital is a key component in understanding the sustainability of Essential's business as cash resources retained within Essential must be sufficient to meet maintenance capital needs to replenish the assets for future cash generation.Net equipment expenditures - This measure is equipment expenditures less proceeds on the disposal of equipment. Essential uses net equipment expenditures to assess net cash flows related to the financing of Essential's oilfield services equipment.ABOUT ESSENTIALEssential is a growth-oriented, dividend paying corporation that provides oilfield services to producers in western Canada for producing wells and new drilling activity. Essential operates the largest coil tubing well service fleet in Canada with 44 coil tubing rigs and a fleet of 56 service rigs. Essential also sells, rents and services downhole tools and equipment including the Tryton Multi-Stage Fracturing System.
