TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Cabinet has approved a blueprint intended to repair the nation's finances and narrow deficits that have ballooned into massive public debt, though the plan lacks details on how to cut costs and raise revenues.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has meanwhile deferred a decision on hiking the sales tax, which might help fortify public finances, but could do more harm than good if it derails the economic recovery.The plan approved Thursday would slash social spending and reduce public works costs by 10 percent. So far, Abe has focused instead on boosting spending to stimulate growth and fight deflation.The plan, part of the budget process for fiscal 2014, comes as the government mulls spending billions to contain radiation-contaminated water at a nuclear plant wrecked by the March 2011 tsunami.
