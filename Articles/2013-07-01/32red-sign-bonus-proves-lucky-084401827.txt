LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - Jul 1, 2013) -
32Red have reported that a new player who registered recently with the online casino has cashed in £12,200 from their first deposit of just £10.The player, Mathew H from Scotland, registered at 32Red Casino on his iPad and claimed the welcome bonus of £32 free when you deposit £10. After trying a few different mobile casino games, the popular Immortal Romance Slot proved lucky for him when the wild symbols rolled in and triggered the big payout.Discussing the win, Mathew commented "I'd like people to know that it is possible to win such a large amount, possibly more, from the free £32 offer. I'll be using my winnings to treat my girlfriend."Head of Marketing for 32Red, Mark Quayle commented: "It's great that Mathew had such a great welcome to 32Red. The win itself isn't unusual - we pay out much bigger amounts - it was the fact that his luck came so soon after claiming our £32 welcome bonus."Quayle added "Mathew had played a few different mobile slots before trying Immortal Romance about an hour after claiming his bonus. A few spins later he won £12,150 from one spin when four reels turned wild. We paid his winnings by same day transfer to ensure the cash got to him as quickly as possible, we hope he enjoys this fantastic windfall and hope his luck continues."The payout of £12,200 isn't likely to cause 32Red too much of a concern. According to their website, they pay out over £2million per day on average and have made two millionaires since their launch in 2002.
