Quarterly sales jumped 14 percent to 2.74 trillion yen ($27.7 billion).Also coming as good news for Japanese exporters like Honda is the weak yen, as it raises the value of overseas earnings and helps bring down its product prices abroad.

But sales have been gradually recovering.Honda has been recording strong sales in the rest of Asia, jumping back from the sales drops caused by the floods in Thailand in 2011.The Japanese have also been recovering from supply disruptions caused by the March 2011 quake and tsunami that devastated its businesses.Tokyo-based Honda expects to sell 4.43 million vehicles for the fiscal year through March 2014.
