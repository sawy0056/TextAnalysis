Trading the News: U.S. Gross Domestic ProductWhat’s Expected:Time of release: 04/26/2013 12:30 GMT, 8:30 EDTPrimary Pair Impact: EURUSDExpected: 3.0%Previous: 0.4%DailyFX Forecast: 1.0% to 1.5%Why Is This Event Important:The advanced GDP report is expected to show the world’s largest economy expanding at an annual rate of 3.0% in the first-quarter, and the faster rate of growth may heighten the appeal of the U.S. dollar as dampens the Fed’s scope to expand the balance sheet further. Although the FOMC continues to promote its highly accommodative policy stance, it seems as though a growing number of central bank officials are looking to scale back on quantitative easing, and we may see the central bank move away from its easing cycle later this year as the economic recovery gradually gathers pace.

The pickup in housing along with the ongoing expansion in consumer credit may produce a strong GDP print, and a positive development should spark a bullish reaction in the greenback as it raises the outlook for the world’s largest economy. However, the slowdown in private sector consumption paired with the persistent weakness in the labor market may drag on the growth rate, and we may see the dollar struggle to hold its ground should the report disappoint. Potential Price Targets For The ReleaseForex_EURUSD-_Trading_the_U.S._1Q_GDP_Report_body_EURUSD_David.png, EUR/USD- Trading the U.S. 1Q GDP ReportMoreAs the EURUSD struggles to push back above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement from the 2009 high to the 2010 low around 1.3120, we may see the head-and-shoulders pattern continue to take shape, and the pair may continue to work its way back towards the 23.6% retracement (1.2640-50) should the U.S. GDP report increase the appeal of the dollar. However, a dismal growth figure may trigger a run at the monthly high (1.3200), and we may see the reversal pattern fail to play out should the data fuel speculation for more Fed support.How To Trade This Event RiskForecasts for a faster rate of growth instills a bullish outlook for the greenback, and a positive development may pave the way for a long U.S. dollar trade as the data dampens bets for more quantitative easing. Therefore, if the growth rate expands 3.0% or greater, we will need a red, five-minute candle following the release to establish a short trade on two-lots of EURUSD. Once these conditions are met, we will set the initial stop at the nearby swing high or a reasonable distance from the entry, and this risk will generate our first target. The second objective will be based on discretion, and we will move the stop on the second lot to breakeven once the first trade hits its mark in an effort to lock-in our profits.In contrast, the ongoing slack in the labor market along with the slowdown in private consumption may drag on the economy, and a dismal growth report may spark a bearish reaction in the USD as it fuels speculation for additional monetary support. As a result, if GDP fails to meet market expectations, we will implement the same strategy for a long euro-dollar as the short position laid out above, just in reverse.Impact that U.S. GDP report has had on USD during the last quarter
