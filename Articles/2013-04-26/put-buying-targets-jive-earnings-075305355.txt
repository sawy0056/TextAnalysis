These are new positions, as the volume was more than 12 times the strike's open interest of just 207 contracts before the session began.JIVE was up a penny yesterday to close at $13.87. The stock rose from below $14 to above $17 between early February and early March, but it has given up all those gains and is now trying to hold support at current levels.Yesterday's puts were not tied to any stock trading identified by our systems in the session but could be a protective hedge on a long position established earlier. These options could also be making a straight bearish bet on JIVE, as they lock in a $12.50 sale price for the stock no matter how far it might fall, but they will expire worthless if shares remain above that level for the next three weeks.
