Equity indexes finally gave up some ground yesterday, pushing the CBOE Volatility Index and its futures higher. The S&P 500 was down 13.81 points, or 0.83 percent, after opening the day by climbing to a new intraday high of 1687.18.

The Nasdaq 100 lost 27.32 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 2999.13. It followed a similar pattern, climbing as high as 3053.51. That price will be resistance, while support is at 2948. The Russell 2000 had the worst percentage loss of 1.65 percent, or 16.52 points, to close at 982.26. It climbed to a new intraday high of 1008.23 and then gave up more than 30 points to the low shortly before the bell. That 1008 level will be resistance, while support is at 966. The VIX was up 0.45 points, or 3.4 percent, to 13.82. It reached a high of 14.45 about 30 minutes before the bell and slipped from there.
