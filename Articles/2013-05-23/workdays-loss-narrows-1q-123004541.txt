However, we believe that the company will face serious competition from large established players such as Oracle (ORCL) in both of its operational markets. This cut-throat competition and increasing investments in product development and personnel cost will hurt profitability going forward.Currently, Workday has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Read the Full Research Report on GOOGRead the Full Research Report on ORCL Read the Full Research Report on JNJ Read the Full Research Report on WDAY Zacks Investment Research More From Zacks.com Read article on zacks.com
