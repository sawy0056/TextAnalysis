US Dollar Technical Analysis– Prices invalidated a bearish Dark Cloud Cover candlestick pattern to break above resistance at 10822, the 50% Fibonacci expansion. Buyers now target the 61.8% level at 10922, with a break above that exposing the 76.4% Fib at 11045. Negative RSI divergence warns of ebbing upward momentum however and hints the move higher may be short-lived. The 10822 mark has been recast as near-term support, with a reversal back beneath that initially eyeing the 38.2% expansion at 10722.Forex_US_Dollar_Technical_Analysis_05.23.2013_body_Picture_5.png, US Dollar Technical Analysis 05.23.2013MoreDaily Chart - Created Using FXCM Marketscope 2.0--- Written by Ilya Spivak, Currency Strategist for Dailyfx.comTo contact Ilya, e-mail ispivak@dailyfx.com.
