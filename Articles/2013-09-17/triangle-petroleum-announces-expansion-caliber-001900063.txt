Estimates 40%-60% revenue and EBITDA growth in calendar year 2015
Use of Non-GAAP MeasuresEBITDA represents income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash items, and non-recurring items. EBITDA is not a calculation based upon generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"). Triangle has presented EBITDA because it regularly reviews EBITDA as a measure of operating performance. Triangle also believes EBITDA assists investors in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash items, and non-recurring items which can vary significantly depending upon many factors.About TriangleTriangle (NYSE MKT: TPLM) is a vertically integrated, growth oriented energy company with a strategic focus on developing the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana.
