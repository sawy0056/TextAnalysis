WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-run House has voted to avoid a partial government shutdown next week but also delay President Barack Obama's health care law.Because of that condition, the White House has promised the overall legislation will be vetoed. That means the two sides are edging closer to a shutdown of many federal services Tuesday morning, with no obvious solution in sight.The House sent the legislation to the Democratic-run Senate early Sunday by 231-192.The bill would delay much of the 2010 health care overhaul for a year. It would also repeal a tax on medical devices that helps finance the health care law.The shutdown bill will probably never reach Obama because the Senate's majority leader, Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, says his chamber will reject the measure first.
