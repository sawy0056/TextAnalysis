WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. military would continue to be paid in the event of a government shutdown under a bill passed on Sunday by the Republican-led House of Representatives.House Republicans drafted the measure as part of a threat to shut down the government this week unless implementation of President Barack Obama's landmark 2010 healthcare law was delayed for a year.Democrats backed the bill but complained that it ignores the value of other federal workers who would be laid off in case of a government shutdown.The House passed the military pay bill unanimously.
