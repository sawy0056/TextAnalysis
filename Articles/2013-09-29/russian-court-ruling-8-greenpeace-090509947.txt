Russian prosecutors are considering whether to charge them with piracy, among other offenses.The Russian Coast Guard disrupted the activists' attempt to scale the oil platform on Sept. 18. The next day, they seized Greenpeace's ship, the Arctic Sunrise, and towed it with the crew aboard to Murmansk.
