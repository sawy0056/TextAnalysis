WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives early on Sunday moved the government closer to a shutdown by rejecting the Democratic-led Senate's supposed final offer for funding federal agencies beyond Monday.In a mostly partisan vote, the House defied a White House veto threat and added to a Senate-passed spending bill a provision repealing a medical device tax intended to help fund President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law.
