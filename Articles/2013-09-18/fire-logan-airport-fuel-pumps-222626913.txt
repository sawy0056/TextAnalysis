BOSTON (AP) -- A fire at Boston Logan International Airport's fuel pumps has sent thick, black smoke into the air but has been quickly contained and has caused no injuries.Airport operator Massport says the fire broke out Tuesday evening and firefighters had it under control about a half-hour later.One of more than a dozen fuel pumps was engulfed in flames. The airport's underground fuel system was temporarily suspended as a precaution. International flights made stops on their way into Logan to get more fuel. Domestic airlines ferried fuel in.The cause of the fire is under investigation. But Massport aviation director Ed Freni (FREHN'-ee) says there's lots of surveillance in the area and the fire isn't considered suspicious.Logan is New England's largest transportation center, handling tens of millions of passengers each year. It's operating normally.
