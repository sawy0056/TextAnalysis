Google did not immediately respond to an inquiry about the status of its driverless car program.California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law last year allowing the Mountain View-based internet giant to test its self-driving cars on the road.(Reporting By Rory Carroll, Editing by Jonathan Weber and Jijo Jacob)
