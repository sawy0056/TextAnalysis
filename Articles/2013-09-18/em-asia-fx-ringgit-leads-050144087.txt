* Real money funds lift ringgit* Philippine peso at near 6-week high on stock inflows hopes* Exporters buy Taiwan dlr on modest Fed tapering views(Adds text, updates prices)By Jongwoo CheonSINGAPORE, Sept 18 (Reuters) - The Malaysian ringgit rose toits highest in more than five weeks on Wednesday, leading gainsamong emerging Asian currencies, as investors bet the U.S.Federal Reserve would scale back its monetary stimulus onlymodestly later in the day.The ringgit advanced on real money funds demand.The Taiwan dollar gained on exporters' bids, while thePhilippine peso hit a near six-week high onexpectations of stock inflows.But the Indonesian rupiah bucked the trend onsustained dollar demand from local companies.The Fed is set to announce the result of its two-day policymeeting later in the day and investors expect it will trim $10billion of its $85 billion monthly bond-buying programme.The U.S. central bank may also seek to reassure markets thatactual policy tightening is still far away."If accompanied by rhetoric from Bernanke to try to keep alid on yields, then dollar/majors should emerge weaker," saidJonathan Cavenagh, a senior FX strategist at Westpac inSingapore, referring to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.Emerging Asian currencies are also seen appreciating,although they have already priced the Fed reduction in to somedegree, he added.Recent weak U.S. economic data caused investors to expectthe Fed may dial down the quantitative easing less thaninitially feared.RINGGITThe ringgit rose as much as 0.6 percent to 3.2300 perdollar, its strongest since Aug. 12, on demand from real moneyfunds.The Malaysian currency gave up some of initial gains asimporters bought dollars for payments on dips and on cautionbefore the Fed's announcement at 1800 GMT and Bernanke's newsconference soon afterwards.But current ringgit levels already have reflected the Fed'scut in its stimulus to some degree, traders said."We might see dollar/Asia lower because a $10 billion taperis already quite priced in," said an Asian bank trader inSingapore."There is a risk that Bernanke might change the 6.5 percentunemployment target to 6 percent to warrant a rate hike becausethey want to keep the long-end yields low," he added.TAIWAN DOLLARThe Taiwan dollar advanced as exporters bought the island'scurrency for settlements before holidays.Those companies also purchased the Taiwan dollar, with someexpectations that it may strengthen further if the Fed reducesits stimulus by as much as expected, traders said.But Taiwanese importers bought U.S. dollar for payments ondips, limiting the local currency's upside.Taiwan financial markets will be closed on Thursday andFriday.PHILIPPINE PESOThe peso gained 0.3 percent to 43.51 per dollar, itsstrongest since Aug 12 on expectations of demand linked toforeign investors' recent stock purchases.Foreigners were net buyers in Manila stocks on Mondayand Tuesday.Traders hesitated to lift the peso above the session highahead of the Fed's announcement, but a foreign bank trader saidthe peso has priced in a $10 billion reduction in the U.S.central bank's bond-buying programme.The Philippine currency may strengthen more, but investorsmay take profits after the decision as they already added longpositions on expectations of the modest policy shift, he added.CURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLARChange on the day at 0430 GMTCurrency Latest bid Previous day Pct MoveJapan yen 99.21 99.12 -0.09Sing dlr 1.2601 1.2594 -0.06Taiwan dlr 29.659 29.760 +0.34*Korean won 1081.40 1084.10 +0.25Baht 31.67 31.77 +0.32Peso 43.55 43.65 +0.23Rupiah 11511.00 11430.00 -0.70Rupee 63.28 63.37 +0.15Ringgit 3.2325 3.2500 +0.54Yuan 6.1216 6.1215 -0.00Change so far in 2013Currency Latest bid End prev year Pct MoveJapan yen 99.21 86.79 -12.52Sing dlr 1.2601 1.2219 -3.03Taiwan dlr 29.659 29.136 -1.76Korean won 1081.40 1070.60 -1.00Baht 31.67 30.61 -3.35Peso 43.55 41.05 -5.74Rupiah 11511.00 9630.00 -16.34Rupee 63.28 54.99 -13.09Ringgit 3.2325 3.0580 -5.40Yuan 6.1216 6.2303 +1.78* Financial markets in South Korea are closed for holidays.(Additional reporting by Miao-jung Lin in TAIPEI; Editing byKim Coghill)
