RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A state judge has found no proof two rail companies tampered with evidence after a tractor-trailer and an Amtrak train collided in 2011, killing six people and injured dozens in northern Nevada.Washoe County District Judge Scott Freeman, in a ruling handed down late Thursday, denied a motion for sanctions against Amtrak and Union Pacific Railroad.Lawyers for John Davis Trucking Co. asked Freeman to punish the rail companies, claiming they tampered with a gate-crossing arm and a video to make it appear its driver was to blame.The Reno Gazette-Journal reports (http://on.rgj.com/1e2tMsM ) that Freeman ruled the allegations are based on "mere conjecture and speculation."His ruling stems from a consolidation of about 20 lawsuits filed by victims against all three companies.The companies also have sued each other in federal court.___Information from: Reno Gazette-Journal, http://www.rgj.com
