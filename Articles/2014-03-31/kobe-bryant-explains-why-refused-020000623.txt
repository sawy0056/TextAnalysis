'You know it's my move,' he said. 'She obviously can see that I can win, so she'll know that I'm not-winning on purpose. Then what's that teaching? So I just play the game, I win—and the kid goes ape s***. She knocked the board over. "Baaaaa!" I was like, "S*** the kid's like me. Damn it.'"Never change, Kobe.View photoskobe daughterMoreElsa/Getty ImagesMore From Business Insider Kobe Bryant Explains Why He Refused To Let His 3-Year-Old Daughter Win At Candy LandA Perfect Picture Of Nick Young Celebrating A 3-Point Shot That Didn't Go InPacers Player Says LeBron James Gives Away What He's Going To Do With His Facial Expression
