Support:102.62-67 (Feb 11 close, Triangle top), 101.46 (Triangle floor)
Resistance: 103.75-104.14 (Mar 7 high, 38.2% Fib exp.), 105.19 (50% Fib exp.) The US Dollar rose as expected against the Japanese Yen to complete a bullish Triangle chart formation, hinting at renewed upside momentum ahead. We will attempt to enter long from here, initially targeting the March 7 high at 103.75. This barrier is bolstered by the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion at 104.14, with a break above that on a daily closing basis exposing the 50% level at 105.19. A stop-loss has been set to activate on a daily close below 101.83. The Triangle top (now at 102.67) has been recast as near-term support, with added reinforcement from a horizontal pivot at 102.62. A reversal below that aims for the Triangle bottom at 101.46. Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
