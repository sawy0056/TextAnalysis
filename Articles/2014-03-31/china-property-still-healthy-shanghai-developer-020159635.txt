China property 'still healthy': Shanghai developerMoreThe recent collapse of a Chinese developer has raised fears over the stability of the mainland property sector, but Vincent Lo, CEO of Shanghai-based developer Shui On Land, says defaults will remain contained."I don't expect you'll see too many of these collapses because the market is actually still quite healthy," Lo told CNBC on Monday.
