It was last at 102.80 yen."Foreign speculators are buying the futures on expectations that fund managers would do some window dressing," Shinkin Asset's Fujiwara added, referring to the buying ahead of the new fiscal year starting on Tuesday.Still, on the quarter, the Nikkei was down 9 percent since the start of the year and is headed for its first quarterly decline in 1-1/2 years, hurt by a slowing in Japan's economy, worries over the tapering of the U.S. Federal Reserve's stimulus and China's economic woes.The market has also been pegged back by concern that consumption will be crimped by Tokyo's sales tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent on April 1.Still, many see the Nikkei's pullback as a necessary correction after a 57 percent rally last year."While Japan's performance has been negative since the start of 2014, we view the current phase as a healthy consolidation phase preparing the stage for a possible up-side breakout," wrote Jesper Koll, head of Japanese equity research at J.P.Morgan, in a note to clients.The market largely shrugged off an unexpected fall in Japan's factory output for February.Aeon Co Ltd jumped as much as 3.3 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said the supermarket chain operator will launch low-cost smartphone services on April 4 priced at less than half the fees major domestic mobile carriers typically charge.The broader Topix added 0.8 percent to 1,196.04 in moderate trade, with trading volume at 28 percent of the full daily average for the past 90 days.The JPX-Nikkei Index 400, a recently introduced gauge comprised of companies with a high return on equity and robust corporate governance, rose 0.9 percent to 10,833.98.(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)
