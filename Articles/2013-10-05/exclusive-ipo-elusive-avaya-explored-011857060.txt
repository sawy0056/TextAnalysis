Avaya and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment while Silver Lake and TPG declined to comment.Asked about an IPO, Avaya's corporate treasurer Matt Booher told the Deutsche Bank Leveraged Finance conference this week: "Everyone is very focused on managing the business, and the things we can control in the business to put ourselves in the right position to be in that gate, if you will, or that position."The company's sales are split roughly equally between products, such as phones and video conferencing devices, and services for the communications networks of companies. It has over 300,000 customers, including more than 95 percent of the Fortune 500 companies.Avaya reported revenue of $5.17 billion in its fiscal 2012, down 7 percent compared to a year ago, while its earnings on an adjusted basis were flat, as the company struggled to maintain the appeal of its products in a highly competitive market. For the third fiscal quarter of 2013, revenue was $1.15 billion, down 8 percent from the year ago.Avaya has looked to acquisitions to boost growth. Its biggest under Silver Lake and TPG was the takeover of bankrupt Nortel Networks Corp's enterprise solutions business for $933 million in 2009. Yet most of the improvements in the company's profits have come from operational changes and cost savings.In its third-quarter earnings call in August, its chief executive, Kevin Kennedy, said that the company's gross margin percentage of 56 percent was the highest for any quarter in Avaya's history.Avaya had $6.1 billion in debt and $303 million in cash at the end of March 2013.
