In relevant part, the release explained:[The Company] expects to report a primarily non-cash, pre-tax charge against inventory and supply commitments in the second quarter of approximately $930 million to $960 million, which is primarily attributable to BlackBerry Z10 devices.Furthermore, the Company also announced that it is targeting an approximate 50% reduction in operating expenditures by the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2015. As part of this, BlackBerry will implement a workforce reduction of approximately 4,500 positions or approximately 40% of the Company's global workforce resulting in a total workforce of approximately 7,000 full-time global employees.As a result of the foregoing disclosure, BlackBerry stock plummeted from a closing price of $10.52 per share on September 19, 2013 to a close of $8.73 per share on September 20, 2013. The value of BlackBerry stock continued to slide on heavy trading volume over the next few days as investors digested the bad news, and closed at $8.01 on September 25, 2013.About Kahn Swick & Foti, LLCTo learn more about KSF, whose partners include the Former Louisiana Attorney General, Charles C.
