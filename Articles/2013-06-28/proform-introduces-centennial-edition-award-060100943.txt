ProForm Tour de France Centennial Edition Console With Google Street View Click here for high-resolution versionMoreLOGAN, UT--(Marketwired - Jun 28, 2013) - ProForm, the world's most popular fitness brand, announces its new Centennial Edition of the official Tour de France training cycle, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the legendary Le Tour de France.Cycling enthusiasts, media and the general public can demo the new bike on June 29-30 in Nice at the Fete Le Tour event, July 6-7 in Annecy at L'Etape du Tour and July 20-21 at Le Tour Fan Park event in London at Cannery Wharf in London.The Centennial edition of ProForm Tour de France cycle features:New ergonomics and geometry to give the fit and feel of a road bike Power Meter Display (watts) with SMR® Silent Magnetic Resistance Universal adjustment for seat forward, seat aft, handlebars and more Adjustable or interchangeable saddle and pedals Freewheel when not pedaling 30 configurable electronic gears integrated on drop down handle bars 7-inch color touchscreen console with built-in Wi-Fi -- displays Google Street View and connects to internet iFit® technology enables cycle to automatically adjust from 20% incline to 20% decline and mimic the terrain of any map drawn with Google Maps Pre-drawn and pre-loaded Google Maps Street View maps of select sections of all 21 stages of the 2013 Tour, enabled by iFit technology iFit membership and app lets you record an outdoor ride, sync to iFit, then re-ride the route with Google Maps Street View and iFit-enabled incline/decline adjustments HD Video shot on location during the 2012 Tour captures the excitement of spectators on the sidelines of Stage 11 - Albertville, Stage 18, Alpe D'Huez and Stage 20, Rambouillet/Paris-Champs Elysées. Shockingly quietTrain with Power™ -- The bike integrates a Power Meter Display (watts) with SMR™ Silent Magnetic Resistance. Power meters are a luxury cycling accessory costing $1500 to $3000 -- an investment not all cyclists make in their training. Power meters provide the purest indicator of cycling performance, providing the cyclist with precise and instantaneous power information.ProForm individually calibrates the Power Display at the factory to assure precision readouts on each bike. ProForm's software engineer for the Power Meter Display project is a dedicated cyclist and will be riding in his sixth LOTOJA race this fall -- the grueling single-day, 206-mile road race from northern Utah to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.Freewheel -- One of the keys to high performance on a bicycle is smooth pedaling using the full pedal stroke. The fixed drive on a studio or "spin" cycle encourages your legs to "coast" across the top and bottom of the pedal stroke, so you are encouraged to "mash" the pedals. The free wheel on the ProForm Tour de France acts the same as the free wheel on a standard road bike, so you train your legs to generate power through the full pedal stroke.Road Bike Real -- Cyclists can choose to use their own saddle and pedals, and make universal adjustments to seat and handlebars.Configurable Gears -- The new bike also features 30 configurable electronic gears to accommodate preferences for double, triple or compact cranks.The latest version of ProForm® Tour de France® training cycle is the best way to experience the range of terrain, just like Tour riders, from the first ever routes on Corsica for stages 1 to 3 to the thigh-burning inclines of the high mountain stages. Notably, this year's Tour has slated a double climb of Alpe d'Huez at Stage 18.The ProForm Tour de France training cycle simulates road biking with three technology innovations: iFit™ Technology Powered by Google Maps™, motorized incline to 20% and decline to 20%, and Intelligent Wind™ resistance technology with power meter.iFit Technology -- Riders logon to the iFit.com website to draw a cycling route anywhere in the world using the Google Maps™ tool. This ProForm bike has a built-in wireless Internet connection so the map is downloaded from iFit.com to the product. Google Street View appears on the product's high-res 7-inch touchscreen and shows a marker that moves to show the rider's progress.Geo-data imbedded in Google Maps™ automatically adjusts the cycle's position and resistance to simulate the mapped terrain. Riders can climb up to a 20% incline or race down a 20% decline.Resistance -- The quest to create an indoor cycle with a smooth, flowing sensation was perfected by ProForm's engineering team, many of whom are cycling enthusiasts. The foremost goal was to simulate the combined resistance from four major factors that affect road cyclists: body size, wind resistance, road grade and tire contact with the road, known as rolling resistance.ProForm's team met its goals with Intelligent Wind™ Resistance technology, and combined with iFit™ Technology and 20% incline to decline, distinguishes this cycle from all bike trainers, indoor cycles or stationary bikes.First, the rider enters his weight at iFit.com, and then ProForm's algorithms use that data to customize the ride to simulate the full road biking experience."We give you all the tools to interact with this bike, just like you'd interact with your road bike," said Greg Law, Director of Engineering for ProForm, an avid cyclist and four-time rider in LOTOJA. "With this bike, every ride is dynamic. You have to accommodate the changing 'terrain' as it happens, downshifting when you encounter an incline, for example, or adjusting your posture to maintain power when the bike tilts uphill.Story continues"With this bike, the concept of shifting gears becomes super relevant," Law said. "It's not about imagining a hill, then turning a knob or changing speed. We give you 30 gears."Resistance adjustments on the ProForm Le Tour de France cycle feel more like the mechanical advantage of shifting gears on a road bike. In fact, the resistance adjustments on the ProForm Tour de France training bike are akin to shifting gears. As the rider changes gears, resistance is changed, along with the speed and distance traveled. Progress along a Google Map™ cycling route drawn with iFit™ Technology will be affected -- the rider's marker will move more slowly upon shifting down during uphill climbs, for example, reflecting the tremendous effort required.ProForm's smooth ride comes from electronically controlled touchless magnetic brakes or resistance, which assures the resistance does not change with use, and provides "repeatable resistance" from ride to ride.Additional features of the Centennial Edition of the ProForm Tour de France bike include:Console displays watts, speed, time, gear, cadence, heart rate, percent incline/decline, distance and calories Interval training screen iFit.com membership for one year, providing the ability to "draw your own" cycling route anywhere in the world there's a Google Map™ Ant+ and BLE wireless chest pulse compatible (receiver included) iPod® compatible with two 2-inch speakers onboard Built-in wireless makes the ProForm Le Tour de France bike "smart fitness" equipment and part of "The Internet of Things" trend Dual water bottle holders in a convenient location on the frame Compact footprint of 58 inches long by 25 inches wide by 59 inches tall is perfect for city dwellers or second homes Transport wheels on front of frame for easy movement from room to roomThe ProForm Tour de France cycle, Centennial Edition, is available for $2499 for pre-order starting June 29 at www.ProForm.com.About ProForm ProForm partnered with Le Tour de France, the world's leading cycling event, to create the official training cycle of the Tour.
