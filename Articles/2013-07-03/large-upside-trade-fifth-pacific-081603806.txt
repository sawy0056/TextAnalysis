One investor is targeting the $25 level on Fifth & Pacific with a highly leveraged trade.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker monitoring system detected a huge ratio spread on the apparel stock. The trader initially bought 5,000 October 23 calls for $1.90 and sold 10,000 October 25 calls for $1.He or she returned less than two hours later, this time snapping up 2,500 of the 23s for $1.85 and selling 5,000 of the 25s for $0.90. Combined, that totals up to 7,500 contracts owned at the lower strike and 15,000 sold at the higher strike. The trader collected a credit of $37,500 in the process.That position will expand to $1.5 million if FNP closes at $25 on expiration. Gains will erode above that level because more calls were sold than were bought. If done in isolation, the trade will face losses above $27.But there is a good chance that the investor is a long-term holder, looking to repair a losing trade. The stock, formerly known as Liz Claiborne, consolidated around $25 in late 2007 before crashing along with the rest of the market.The investor may have gotten long around $25 and now wishes to leverage a rebound to that level. Above it, the trader will simply relinquish their shares to cover the short calls.
