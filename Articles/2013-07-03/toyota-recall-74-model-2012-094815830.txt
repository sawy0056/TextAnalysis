Toyota announced that it will conduct a voluntary safety recall involving approximately 74 Model Year 2012 Toyota Yaris vehicles. In the involved vehicles, a relay in the Power Steering Control Module of the electronic power steering system could experience a short circuit due to insufficient distances between terminals in the relay and moisture contamination of relay coil windings, the company said.
