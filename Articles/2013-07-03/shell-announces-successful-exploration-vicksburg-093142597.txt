Shell announces a successful exploratory well at Vicksburg in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The well is located 75 miles offshore in the De Soto Canyon Block 393 in 7,446 feet of water. It was drilled to a total depth of 26,385 feet and encountered more than 500 feet of net oil pay. In total, the Vicksburg "A" discovery is estimated to hold potentially recoverable resources of more than 100 million barrels of oil equivalent, or mmboe. It adds to the more than 500 mmboe of potentially recoverable resources that have already been discovered and appraised at the nearby Appomattox discovery. Vicksburg "A" is a separate accumulation from both Appomattox and the 2007 Vicksburg "B" discovery.
