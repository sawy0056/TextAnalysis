That's tops off a massive gain of 132% in the last year.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. View our latest analysis for ST International Holdings How Does ST International Holdings's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?ST International Holdings has a P/E ratio of 9.09. The image below shows that ST International Holdings has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the luxury industry average (9.0).SEHK:8521 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 11th 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that ST International Holdings shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.ST International Holdings's earnings per share grew by -2.5% in the last twelve months.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Is Debt Impacting ST International Holdings's P/E?The extra options and safety that comes with ST International Holdings's HK$21m net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.The Bottom Line On ST International Holdings's P/E RatioST International Holdings trades on a P/E ratio of 9.1, which is below the HK market average of 10.6. Earnings improved over the last year. And the healthy balance sheet means the company can sustain growth while the P/E suggests shareholders don't think it will. What is very clear is that the market has become less pessimistic about ST International Holdings over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 6.5 back then to 9.1 today. For those who like to invest in turnarounds, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But others might consider the opportunity to have passed.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
