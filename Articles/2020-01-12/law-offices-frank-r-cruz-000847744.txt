Cruz Reminds Investors of Looming Deadline in the Class Action Lawsuit Against Yunji Inc. (YJ)GlobeNewswireJanuary 11, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareLOS ANGELES, Jan. 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz reminds investors of the upcoming January 13, 2020 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of Yunji, Inc., (“Yunji” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: YJ) investors who purchased American Depositary Shares (“ADSs” or “shares”) pursuant and/or traceable to the registration statement and prospectus (collectively, the “Registration Statement”) issued in connection with the Company’s May 2019 initial public offering (“IPO” or the “Offering”).If you are a shareholder who suffered a loss, click here to participate.On May 3, 2019, the Company held its IPO in which it sold 11,217,447 shares for $11.00 per share.On August 22, 2019, the Company disclosed a supply chain restructuring that shifted part of its merchandise sales to its marketplace platform, resulting in a year-over-year decrease in total revenues for second quarter 2019.On this news, the Company’s share price fell $1.21, nearly 11%, to close at $9.39 per share on August 22, 2019, thereby injuring investors. The share price continued to decline by $3.34, or over 35%, over the next three consecutive trading sessions to close at $6.05 per share on August 27, 2019, thereby injuring investors further.By the commencement of this action, Yunji’s shares were trading as low as $4.40 per share, a nearly 60% decline from the $11 per share IPO price.The Registration Statement was false and misleading and omitted to state material adverse facts. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the Company was shifting certain of its sales to its marketplace platform; (2) that this supply chain restructuring was likely to disrupt Yunji’s relationships with suppliers; (3) that this supply chain restructuring was likely to have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial results; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects, were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.Follow us for updates on Twitter: twitter.com/FRC_LAW.If you purchased or otherwise acquired Yunji ADSs pursuant or traceable to the Registration Statement, you may move the Court no later than January 13, 2020 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.  To be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action.  If you wish to learn more about this class action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to the pending class action lawsuit, please contact Frank R.
