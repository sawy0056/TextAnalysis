But no-one is immune from buying too high. Zooming in on an example, the PanAsialum Holdings Company Limited (HKG:2078) share price dropped 55% in the last half decade. That's an unpleasant experience for long term holders. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 47% over the last twelve months. Furthermore, it's down 21% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. See our latest analysis for PanAsialum Holdings PanAsialum Holdings wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.Over half a decade PanAsialum Holdings reduced its trailing twelve month revenue by 10% for each year. That's definitely a weaker result than most pre-profit companies report. Arguably, the market has responded appropriately to this business performance by sending the share price down 15% (annualized) in the same time period. We don't generally like to own companies that lose money and don't grow revenues. You might be better off spending your money on a leisure activity.

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.A Different PerspectivePanAsialum Holdings shareholders are down 47% for the year, but the market itself is up 10%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 15% over the last half decade.
