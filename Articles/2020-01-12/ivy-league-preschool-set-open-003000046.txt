The academy accomplishes this by introducing multi-sensory activities, fine motor development through play and outdoor activities to develop gross motor skills.  In the Toddler Program, the curriculum implements developmentally appropriate practices for toddlers as they learn to engage in the physical, natural and social worlds, by observing, manipulating, and exploring.  The preschoolers and pre-kindergartners are advanced in science, technology, and mathematics fundamentals by using robotics and coding to build computation thinking skills such as algorithms, sequencing, engineering design process. Preschool students gain independence and self-control, take initiative and assert themselves in socially acceptable ways, as they learn to express their ideas and understand others more effectively. The main focus of this age group is to lay a solid educational foundation for Kindergarten Readiness by preparing students with essential skills to further develop, grow, achieve, and succeed as they transition to Kindergarten and beyond.Each Préscolaire academy is like a family. The employees are personally invested in the wellbeing and success of each child. Everyone serving at Préscolaire is valued and appreciated for their individuality and unique contributions, empowered to make the best possible choice in every interaction. At Préscolaire Early Learning Academy, the curriculum incorporates digital literacy and robotics to provide measurable outcomes in math, science, literacy and critical thinking, emphasizing the cognitive and social skills required to survive and thrive in the 21st century. Young learners are born with an innate ability to solve problems, face challenges with flexibility, and handle change. The Préscolaire approach is to help our students make the very most of those qualities early on, developing the basic skills and critical thinking that will serve them for the rest of their lives. At Préscolaire, we believe in Higher Education, Earlier. Contact informationTel: 866-760-0887Email: info@prescolaireus.comWebsite: www.prescolaireus.comRelated Imagesengineering-for-preschoolers.png Engineering for Preschoolershands-on-curriculum.png Hands on curriculum education-made-fun.png Education made funsmall-group-size.png Small group sizeRelated Linkswww.prescolaireus.com Related Videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EL0j0CjENc CisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-ivy-league-preschool-set-to-open-300985180.htmlSOURCE Prescolaire Early Learning AcademyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
