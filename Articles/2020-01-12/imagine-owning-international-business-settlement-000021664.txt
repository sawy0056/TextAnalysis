But you want to avoid the really big losses like the plague. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of International Business Settlement Holdings Limited (HKG:147), who have seen the share price tank a massive 90% over a three year period. That would certainly shake our confidence in the decision to own the stock. Furthermore, it's down 15% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.We really feel for shareholders in this scenario. It's a good reminder of the importance of diversification, and it's worth keeping in mind there's more to life than money, anyway. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Settlement Holdings Because International Business Settlement Holdings made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.In the last three years, International Business Settlement Holdings saw its revenue grow by 24% per year, compound. That is faster than most pre-profit companies. So on the face of it we're really surprised to see the share price down 53% a year in the same time period. You'd want to take a close look at the balance sheet, as well as the losses. Ultimately, revenue growth doesn't amount to much if the business can't scale well. Unless the balance sheet is strong, the company might have to raise capital.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SEHK:147 Income Statement, January 11th 2020MoreIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies.
