In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Zhejiang Tengy Environmental Technology:0.059 = CN¥44m ÷ (CN¥1.5b - CN¥758m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Zhejiang Tengy Environmental Technology has an ROCE of 5.9%. See our latest analysis for Zhejiang Tengy Environmental Technology Does Zhejiang Tengy Environmental Technology Have A Good ROCE?ROCE is commonly used for comparing the performance of similar businesses.

This performance could be negative if sustained, as it suggests the business may underperform its industry.

Investors may wish to consider higher-performing investments.We can see that, Zhejiang Tengy Environmental Technology currently has an ROCE of 5.9%, less than the 26% it reported 3 years ago.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle.

The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Story continuesZhejiang Tengy Environmental Technology has total liabilities of CN¥758m and total assets of CN¥1.5b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 50% of its total assets. Zhejiang Tengy Environmental Technology has a fairly high level of current liabilities, meaningfully impacting its ROCE.Our Take On Zhejiang Tengy Environmental Technology's ROCENotably, it also has a mediocre ROCE, which to my mind is not an appealing combination.
