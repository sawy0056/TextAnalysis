But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 32%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund. Check out our latest analysis for China Sanjiang Fine Chemicals While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, China Sanjiang Fine Chemicals moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.We note that the dividend has fallen in the last five years, so that may have contributed to the share price decline.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:2198 Income Statement, January 11th 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on China Sanjiang Fine Chemicals's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for China Sanjiang Fine Chemicals the TSR over the last 5 years was -5.5%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in China Sanjiang Fine Chemicals had a tough year, with a total loss of 10.0% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 10%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.1% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
