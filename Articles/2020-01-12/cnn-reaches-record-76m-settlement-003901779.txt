The settlement will benefit more than 300 people, officials said.“The settlement demonstrates the Board’s continued commitment to enforcing the law and ensuring employees who were treated unfairly obtain the monetary relief ordered by the Board,” General Counsel Peter B. Robb said in the statement.The NLRB said CNN ended its contract with a unionized subcontractor, Team Video Services, and then replaced the workers with new employees “without recognizing or bargaining with the two unions that had represented the TVS employees.”“After more than a decade of litigation, negotiation and appeals we are pleased to have resolved a longstanding legal matter,” a CNN spokesperson said.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHong Kong arrests publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai over protests in AugustThe TelegraphHong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested on illegal assembly chargesReutersSAG-AFTRA Rallies For First Contract With Spanish Broadcasting SystemDeadlineDiscovery Profit Rises Despite Cord-Cutting and New InvestmentsVarietyLabor union unveils $150M campaign to help defeat TrumpAssociated PressBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
