Hoback questioned the CEO asking him, ' Do you still think privacy is dead?' 'What are your real thoughts on privacy?' Zuckerberg asked Hoback to stop filming, and he promptly switched off his video camera, causing Zuckerberg to relax ... "Hoback may have switched off his camera but he had another camera disguised in his glasses, which kept recording Zuckerberg. The scene will be included in Hoback's film, "Terms and Conditions May Apply." The filmmaker says his main motivation for filming Zuckerberg was to have him say, "Look, I don't want you to record me."Hoback's film is shedding light on a serious issue that affects every Internet user, privacy. The more open and free the Internet becomes, the less privacy users will have. Hoback didn't say exactly what Zuckerberg said to him, but did say that the statistics and information he has learned making this documentary turned it into a "horror film."More From Business Insider Facebook Just Launched A New Feature: Here's How To Protect Your Profile From Unwanted Searches8 Simple Online Privacy Tips Everyone Needs To Know7 Rules For Communicating With A Business Contact
