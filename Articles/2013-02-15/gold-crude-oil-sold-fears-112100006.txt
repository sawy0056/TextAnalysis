Follow-Through Unlikely as Global Policymakers Opt for the Status-Quo Position Crude oil and copper prices are under pressure in European trade as all eyes turn to the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Moscow. The move may be reflecting concerns about strengthening rhetoric against the so-called “currency wars”, which could be interpreted to imply limits on central banks’ accommodative policies. Gold and silver are likewise down, which seems reasonable considering such an outcome would trim demand for anti-fiat hedges against global reflation.On balance, the sit-down will probably disappoint such lofty goals however. Although policymakers are sure to offer plenty of lip-service to the importance of avoiding competitive devaluation, nothing concrete is likely to emerge (as usual).
