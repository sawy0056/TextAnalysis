Cell Therapeutics announced that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a non-departmental public body of the Department of Health in the United Kingdom, has notified CTI and issued a statement on their website stating that CTI's patient access scheme has been approved by the Department of Health and the appeal stage of this appraisal topic is suspended. The draft final appraisal document and evaluation report have been removed from the NICE website, since it is no longer relevant. NICE has agreed that the Appraisal Committee will consider the new evidence on the cost effectiveness of PIXUVRI at its meeting on September 11.
