LEEDS, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - Jul 8, 2013) -
Lets Safe has partnered with Callcredit Information Group to offer the most innovative and competitive tenant vetting service on the market.By integrating Callcredit's credit checking service, CallReport, Lets Safe will be able to provide their clients with a fast and accurate facility to evaluate the risk of potential tenants. Lets Safe's referencing software identifies many factors which can influence a tenant's likelihood to fulfil rental repayments such as adverse public data like CCJs, IVAs and Bankruptcies, as well as confirming the applicants' identity by verifying their name, date of birth and address history.By providing the data through an API, Lets Safe clients can 'white label' the service seamlessly into their own websites, or they can opt for the easy-to-use interface which is accessible from both desktops and mobile devices speeding up the tenant vetting process. The Callcredit data searches enable Lets Safe's clients to make smart and informed decisions based on the high quality information they receive.Lets Safe will further strengthen the level of insight they can offer to their clients by integrating Callcredit's TenantID - a national database soon to be launched that provides vital information about the history of prospective tenants - for example if a tenant has not paid rent, how much they owe, if there has been any anti-social behaviour, or if they have misused the property.Tom Dutton, Partner at Lets Safe, said, "Callcredit have shown first-class customer and technical support throughout the integration process, offering flexibility that we have previously been unable to get from other vendors. The high quality of their data, ease of integration and the wide range of capabilities that Callcredit has to offer has given us piece of mind, so that we have the confidence to widen our vision and focus on expanding our product base and global reach, without the need to worry about the basics. As a result, our product is now capable of being extremely scalable and we've already had overwhelming interest from letting agents who haven't been satisfied with some of the other vetting companies out there."Sadie Guymer, Business Development Manager at Callcredit commented, "There has been a huge surge in the number of people renting in the last couple of years and it is therefore vital that landlords can quickly and efficiently verify prospective tenants. Lets Safe continue to lead the way in tenant referencing by offering their clients a range of innovative solutions to secure the most suitable tenants for their properties. We are delighted that they have chosen us to support the growth of their business and endeavour to continue to assist them in the coming years."Landlords and letting agents who are interested in an economical and refreshing outlook on tenant referencing should visit Lets Safe at www.letssafe.com.www.letssafe.com About Callcredit Information Group - www.callcredit.co.ukCallcredit Information Group's leading approach to deploying consumer information brings together experts across the fields of credit referencing, marketing services, interactive solutions and consultative analytics to provide clients with a range of innovative and effective products to discover new customers and to engage with current customers to optimise and increase profitability.Products include award-winning fraud verification tools and database solutions to positively verify consumers, global operations to help expand businesses into new markets, digital solutions to improve the overall journey consumers make during interaction with a brand, customer handling to ensure consumer satisfaction at all levels and consumer data and segmentation to improve understanding and targeting of customers and prospects.Callcredit also offers products to assess a customer's credit risk and affordability and its experts in collections and recoveries provide tailored debt recovery and tracing tools.
