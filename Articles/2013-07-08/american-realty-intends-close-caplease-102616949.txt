American Realty (ARCP) reaffirmed its intention to close its previously announced merger with CapLease (LSE). Following CapLease's announcement of the expiration of its 40-day "go shop" period without receipt of any alternative proposals, the company expects to close the transaction in the third quarter of 2013. CapLease's recent filing of its preliminary proxy statement in connection with its special meeting, at which CapLease stockholders will vote whether to approve the merger, and the expiration of the "go shop" period, provide ARCP with a clear timetable for the closing of the CapLease acquisition.
