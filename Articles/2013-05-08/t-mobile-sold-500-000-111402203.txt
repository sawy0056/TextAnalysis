john legere t-mobile ceo announces iphone 5Steve Kovach/Business InsiderT-Mobile CEO John Legere.T-Mobile, the last major US carrier to sell the iPhone, announced yesterday that it has already sold 500,000 units since the phone launched on April 12. That's pretty good, considering most other smartphones don't come close to those sales numbers in such a short time, even if they're offered on multiple carriers.  It's also impressive because the iPhone 5 launched about eight months ago.In previous earnings statements, T-Mobile has blamed the fact that it didn't carry the iPhone for losing subscribers to other carriers that did. T-Mobile has also changed the way it charges for service plans, eliminating contracts and letting customers pay month to month instead.The carrier no longer requires customers to sign a two-year contract to get a subsidized smartphone. Instead, customers can make a down payment on a phone and pay it off gradually over two years. For example, T-Mobile sells the iPhone 5 for $100 down plus $20 per month for 24 months.T-Mobile also reported $1.2 billion in earnings for the first quarter of 2013 before taxes, interest, depreciation, and amortization. More From Business Insider Nokia Took Out A Two-Page Ad In Vanity Fair To Show Off Its New Windows Phone That Hasn't Even Been Announced YetVerizon Is Working On A Way To Save You $100 On The iPhone 5How To Remove All The Junk Carriers Added To Your Samsung Galaxy S4
