Patrick Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer of NTIC. “Over the past three months, demand appears to have stabilized in both North America and China, allowing ZERUST® industrial net sales to increase 9.0% and 18.0% in North America and China, respectively, compared to fiscal 2019 fourth quarter.  In addition, we continued to benefit from year-over-year sales growth for Natur-Tec.  The timing of several ZERUST® oil & gas projects impacted first quarter performance.  However, based on expected shipments and installations for the second quarter, we believe we will see a year-over-year increase in ZERUST® oil & gas net sales for both the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020.” NTIC’s consolidated net sales increased 3.8% to $14,631,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to $14,094,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2018.  The increase in consolidated net sales was primarily a result of higher ZERUST® industrial sales and sales of Natur-Tec® products. The following table sets forth NTIC’s net sales by product category for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, by segment:   Three Months Ended
November 30, 2019   % of Net Sales       November 30, 2018   % of Net Sales     %  Change
ZERUST® industrial net sales $   8,843,052   60.4 %   $   8,595,814   61.0 %   2.9 %
ZERUST® joint venture net sales     585,616   4.0 %       483,187   3.4 %   21.2 %
ZERUST® oil & gas net sales     520,843   3.6 %       986,173   7.0 %   (47.2 )%
Total ZERUST® net sales $   9,949,511   68.0 %   $   10,065,174   71.4 %   (1.1 )%
Total Natur-Tec® net sales     4,681,889   32.0 %       4,028,878   28.6 %   16.2 %
Total net sales $   14,631,400   100.0 %   $   14,094,052   100.0 %   3.8 % NTIC’s joint venture operating income decreased 22.7% to $2,652,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to joint venture operating income of $3,433,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2018.  The decrease was attributable to the corresponding decrease in total sales of the joint ventures, as fees for services provided to joint ventures are a function of the net sales of NTIC’s joint ventures, which were $25,460,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2019, compared to $30,480,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2018. Operating expenses, as a percent of net sales, for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were 40.3%, compared to 43.8% for the same period last fiscal year.  This reduction was primarily a result of lower general and administrative expenses, combined with operating leverage on increased net sales. The company reported net income attributable to NTIC for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 of $1,213,000, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to NTIC of $1,497,000, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the same period last fiscal year.  NTIC’s balance sheet remains strong, with no debt, and working capital of $25,253,000 at November 30, 2019, including $4,107,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $2,987,000 in available for sale securities, compared to $25,461,000 at August 31, 2019, including $5,857,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $3,565,000 in available for sale securities. At November 30, 2019, the company had $25,403,000 of investments in joint ventures, of which over $14,200,000 or 56% is cash, with the remaining balance mostly made up of other working capital. Mr. Lynch added, “Customer demand remained soft at many of our global joint ventures, and this had a material impact on first quarter profitability. Based on current market feedback, we believe global ZERUST® industrial sales will remain challenging during the second quarter.  Despite the effect of lower joint venture operating income, we believe we are still well positioned to increase profitability overall this fiscal year as a result of continued growth at NTIC China and Natur-Tec, as well as improving demand for ZERUST® oil & gas products and services.”OutlookFor the fiscal year ending August 31, 2020, NTIC continues to expect net sales to be in the range of $62 million and $66 million.  The company also continues to anticipate net income attributable to NTIC to be in the range of $5.6 million to $7.5 million, or $0.60 and $0.80 per diluted share.Story continuesThese estimates are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those described below under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements.”Conference Call and WebcastNTIC will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. Central Time to review its results of operations for the first quarter of 2020 and its outlook, followed by a question and answer session.  The conference call will be available to interested parties through a live audio webcast available through NTIC’s website at www.ntic.com or https://ntic.gcs-web.com/events-presentations where the webcast will be archived and accessible for at least 12 months.  The dial-in number for the conference call is (877) 670-9776 and the confirmation code is 8647749.About Northern Technologies International Corporation Northern Technologies International Corporation develops and markets proprietary, environmentally beneficial products and services in over 60 countries either directly or via a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures, independent distributors and agents.  NTIC’s primary business is corrosion prevention marketed primarily under the ZERUST® brand.
