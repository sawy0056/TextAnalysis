Vermont, took the #10 spot on this year's list, but had been ranked #41 in last year's report.  Similarly, Iowa, which had clocked in at #35 last year, moved up to #9 in the 2020 report. And, Colorado, which had been ranked #21 in last year's report, took the coveted #1 spot this year. So, what are the winning factors for this year's top crop?  These states all possess a healthy mix of pro-business climates and "woman-positive" financial environment. Feisty outliers such as Florida, Georgia and Iowa all delivered the winning elements along with more traditional "business hubs" including California, New York and Massachusetts. The editors at FitSmallBusiness.com compiled data from key data sources including Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship, Tax Foundation's State Corporate Income Tax Rates, World Population Review's Cost of Living Index, and more, to rank each state.  This research and analysis determined which are the best for female entrepreneurs – the publication's third annual study of "Best States for Female Entrepreneurs".You can find the full list HERE:THE TOP 10 STATES FOR FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS – 20201)  Colorado2)  California3)  Washington4)  New York5)  Texas6)  Florida7)  Massachusetts8)  Georgia9)  Iowa10)   VermontMETHODOLOGYFitSmallBusiness used the following metrics and weights to analyze and eventually rank the Best States for Female Entrepreneurs:1)  Start-Up Climate and Opportunity (35%)Growth rate Survival rate New job creation and "opportunity share" of new entrepreneurs2)  Economic & Financial Health (15%)Cost of living Corporate tax rate3)  Women's Health & Safety (15%)Female uninsured rate Political representation Reproductive rights Homicide rate4)  Women's Business Opportunity (35%)Share of women-owned businesses Economic "clout" Rates of unemployment Amount of VC dollars going to female entrepreneurs"All the data shows that female entrepreneurship is on the rise," according to Michael De Medeiros, Special Projects Editor, FitSmallBusiness. "Our goal, this year, was to really focus on the data that specifically relates to women and their ability to work, live and thrive in any given state in conjunction with what makes for a healthy business environment.  What we discovered is that some states that we previously thought were perfect, are not necessarily the best for the very unique journeys that female entrepreneurs have to navigate.  We hope that our continuing efforts to identify the best states for women entrepreneurship will lead to new, dynamic businesses throughout the country."About FitSmallBusiness.com:With a rapidly growing monthly readership of more than 3 million, FitSmallBusiness.com is an online publication devoted to helping small business owners.  Its full-time staff of writers spends hours of research, data analysis, and interviews with industry experts to answer the questions that owners want in order to run a successful small business. For more information on this list and this topic, please contact Sarah Johnson, 231893@email4pr.com,  917-864-6355.CisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/what-women-entrepreneurs-wantin-a-startup-location-ny-co-ca-wa-tx-all-strike-the-right-balance-for-female-led-businesses-300981910.htmlSOURCE FitSmallBusiness.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextUS patient with coronavirus of unknown origin denied test for daysAFPKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergRangers rally past Canadiens 5-2 for 5th straight winThe Associated PressAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
