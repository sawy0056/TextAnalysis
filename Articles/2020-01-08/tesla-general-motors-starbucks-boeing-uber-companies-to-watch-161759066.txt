A half-dozen buyers drove away with new Model 3 sedans on Tuesday. Musk also signaled Tesla plans to set up a design center in China, but hasn't given any details. Tesla had started delivering cars to select employees last week.At the same time, China is slamming the brakes on General Motors (GM). GM sold a little over 3 million cars there last year. That's about a 15% decline from the year before and its biggest drop ever in China. The slide may continue. A GM exec said, "We expect the market downturn to continue in 2020, and anticipate ongoing headwinds in our China business."Starbucks (SBUX) is rolling out more dairy-free options in the midwest. The coffee giant is adding Oatly brand oat milk to its lineup in 1300 cafes throughout the region. It will also add two new dairy-free drinks to all U.S. locations — Almondmilk Honey Flat White and the Coconutmilk Latte. The alternative milk market topped $2 billion in 2018 as Americans drink less cow's milk. Boeing (BA) says it won’t furlough any employees when it suspends production of the 737 Max jet. The company said it would move up to 3,000 workers off 737 production to help oversee other grounded jets, and assist building other aircraft, and one of the 737 Max jet’s parts suppliers, Spirit Aerosystems, is halting production and looking into a voluntary layoff package for some of its workers.  The Justice Department is closing a bribery case against Uber (UBER). It won't take any action against the company after allegations of corruption practices in India, China, Indonesia and Malaysia. It's good timing for Uber since it will help them close a deal to acquire Dubai-based ride-sharing rival Careem.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergGlobal coronavirus cases rise as China’s downward trend continuesPA Media: World NewsChina's February factory PMI seen at lowest since 2009 as coronavirus slams production: Reuters pollReutersFed seen cutting rates amid virus threat, low inflationReutersBaidu Becomes Latest Tech Giant to Deliver Disappointing OutlookBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
