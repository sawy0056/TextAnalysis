Orbbec, one of the world's largest 3D camera manufacturers, is demonstrating the implementation of its products and systems with those capabilities at 2020 CES, giving attendees a look at the next big advances in 3D-enabled technology.OrbbecMoreLeading the lineup of products at the Orbbec exhibit is a new "smart lock" using facial recognition technology. The lock, perfect for business, home, or even hotel use, only needs one to two seconds of facial scanning with 3D camera to identify if someone is allowed inside without the need for keys. Employing a "live-ness detection algorithm," the solution can prevent biometric spoofing and is capable of handling financial-grade security to ensure security and ease of use."The ability for AI-enabled robots and devices to both see and recognize the world around them is changing scores of industries," noted David Chen, co-founder and director of engineering at Orbbec. "Smart home devices are an extremely hot topic at CES this year—and with this next generation smart lock, people will keep their homes more secure. It's time to throw away the keychain and use your face to unlock your door."Thousands of ApplicationsOrbbec's line of advanced 3D cameras enable a host of uses in both outdoor and indoor environments, from face identification and gesture recognition to three-dimensional measurement, SLAM (Simultaneous Location And Mapping), augmented reality, mobile and more. As a leading provider of 3D cameras, the company's products are featured in solutions from thousands of companies globally.Along with the smart lock, Orbbec has partnered with six different companies to showcase the abilities of embedded 3D cameras. Audiences at Orbbec's CES exhibit will see:A restaurant food service robot from Bear Robotics, using Orbbec's Astra Mini camera to achieve SLAM. An AR-enabled industrial training platform from Light Guide Systems, using Orbbec's Astra Mini camera to provide workers a smarter environment by teaching critically needed skills.
