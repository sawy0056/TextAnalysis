But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Carpenter Technology Corporation (NYSE:CRS) share price is up 34% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. On the other hand, the more recent gain of 23% over a year is certainly pleasing. See our latest analysis for Carpenter Technology To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Carpenter Technology moved from a loss to profitability. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:CRS Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how Carpenter Technology has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Carpenter Technology's TSR for the last 3 years was 40%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveCarpenter Technology shareholders gained a total return of 25% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 4.5% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy.
