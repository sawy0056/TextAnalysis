Metcalf.The Tolberts starred in separate seasons of ABC's "The Bachelor" and "The Bachelorette" before they met on ABC's second season of “Bachelor in Paradise." They wed soon after and have two young children together.In a statement provided to FOX Business on Tuesday, the couple said they respected DraftKings’ need for due diligence, but they had questions about the fairness of the accusations.“[W]e must ponder, would the questions, accusations and curiosity about this win be the same if the winner had been male and someone who wasn’t already in the public eye?” the statement reads. “It is incredibly important for us to establish that Jade’s win is nothing more than pure luck and we are confident that Draft Kings will determine the same.”Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the sports betting site told FOX Business that DraftKings checks all major contests’ results and the company's review into the Milly Maker tournament's results is "standard."“The DraftKings compliance team reviews the results of all major contests to ensure they comply with our Terms of Use and applicable state regulations. We take the integrity and fairness of our DFS contests seriously, and prizes are not paid out until our reviews are complete," the spokesperson said, later noting: "This is not an investigation."DraftKings, which outlines its "unacceptable behaviors" on its website, initially congratulated Jade Tolbert on Twitter before deleting the tweet, according to the New York Post. When she responded to the company’s message, she received a flurry of negative attention from users who showed screenshots of the couple’s lineups.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREThe Tolberts played 150 lineups each, according to one social media user’s screenshot, and reportedly never played the same quarterbacks, another user wrote.And despite Jade Tolbert's claims that her husband told her not to pick Metcalf, a different screenshot shows she chose the player 88 percent of the time, and he did so roughly 78 percent.READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS BY CLICKING HEREDRAFTKINGS TAKES BIG STEP BY LAUNCHING ITS IPO: REPORTOther social media users came to Jade Tolbert’s defense, with one noting: “they won fair and square.”LEAGUES FINALLY CASH IN ON SPORTS BETTING BY SELLING DATARelated ArticlesHow Much is Michael Phelps Worth?Ryan Lochte's Brand Value Sinks Amid Rio ScandalHere's How You Get a Body Like An OlympianReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNew York Times Editor Discovers Lady Gaga's New ‘Mystery Man’ Is Actually Her ExHuffPostDisney Star Skai Jackson Files Restraining Order Against Bhad Bhabie as Social Media Feud EscalatesPeopleBiggest cyber attacks in historyFox Business‘Corona beer virus’ and ‘beer coronavirus’ searches increase as fears of outbreak spreadUSA TODAYBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
