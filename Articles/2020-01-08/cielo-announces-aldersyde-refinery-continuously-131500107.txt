(CSE: CMC - OTCQB: CWSFF) ("Cielo" or the "Company") and Renewable U Grande Prairie Inc., Renewable U Medicine Hat Inc., Renewable U Brooks Inc., Renewable U Lethbridge Inc. and Seymour Capital Incorporated, (collectively "the JV Companies") have agreed to extend the deadline by which they will enter into the previously announced joint venture agreements to March 31, 2020. These agreements will govern the building and operation of the first five follow-on refineries to be placed on production in the agreed territories in Alberta and Ontario ("Follow-on JV Refineries"). Over the past six months, Cielo has been implementing enhancements to the Company's waste-to-energy refinery in Aldersyde, Alberta ("Aldersyde Refinery"), which has resulted in plans to scale up production of the Follow-On JV Refineries to produce 4,000 liters of renewable fuels per hour and operate 24 hours a day, 341 days per year, which is double the production originally contemplated. Each one of the Follow-On JV Refineries are projected to cost approximately CDN$50 Million to build, commission and place on production, to be funded by the respective JV Companies. Collectively, the Follow-On JV Refineries are projected to convert 327,360 tonnes of garbage into 163,680,000 liters of renewable fuels annually.Raphael Bohlmann, President of Renewable U Energy Inc., which currently holds the controlling interest in four of the five Follow-on JV Refineries, stated "We are working closely with Cielo to advance the building of our follow-on refineries as quickly as possible. We are very impressed and appreciative of the tenacity and work ethic that Cielo's management and their contractors have exhibited while overcoming multiple challenges in bringing on stream the world's first waste to renewable fuels green refinery at Aldersyde, Alberta. We are in the final stages of securing the land to build our first follow-on refinery to process scrap railway ties into high grade renewable diesel pursuant to Cielo's Service Supply Agreement with CP Rail, which was press released on November 28, 2019. We are looking forward to announcing with Cielo its location in the near future."Operational UpdateCielo and its contractors have worked diligently over the past 6 months to finish optimizing the design of the Aldersyde Refinery, which required extensive changes to the process as well as the installation of multiple new pieces of equipment that were required before being able to bring its waste to energy green refinery back into continuous-flow production. The Aldersyde Refinery is operating full-time on a continuous-flow basis producing renewable naphtha and diesel from wood biomass. This is a major achievement for Cielo and its shareholders. The Aldersyde Refinery is operating at approximately 100 lph currently but, as Cielo's newly hired, full-time operational staff completes training and becomes comfortable over the coming days and weeks, production will be increased to process significantly more waste into high grade renewable fuels, beginning immediately with 200 lph.Cielo is continuing to work on further enhancements and improvements to its process, as well as working with the Alberta Government to secure amendments to the Company's operating permit to allow additional waste feedstocks to be utilized. Although the final decision to choose the optimal desulfurization process has not yet been made, Cielo's management continues to be confident that the companies with which Cielo is working will be in a position to deliver a cost-effective solution based on the lab results that are being obtained. Cielo has recently engaged a third-party engineering company to start reviewing its current design drawings so that Cielo can move forward expeditiously with the building of the Follow-On JV Refineries with the JV Companies once the definitive agreements are concluded.Don Allan, President & CEO of Cielo, stated "We are extremely pleased to finally announce that we are flowing continuously and moving closer to revenues. While we still have more work to do and our refinery remains in the final stage of being commissioned, we are confident that once our Aldersyde Refinery is up and running at commercial production levels, the world will understand just how significant our company will be in making the planet a better place for generations to come. We so appreciate the unwavering support of Renewable U Energy and their subsidiary companies as well as Seymour Capital as we move forward with validating our technology, which has the potential to reduce the amount of garbage going into landfills."Story continuesCielo to Host Investor Update Webinar On Friday, January 10th, 2020 at 11 AM EST (9 AM MST), Cielo's President & CEO, Don Allan, will be providing an in-depth overview of its current operations and upcoming milestones.
