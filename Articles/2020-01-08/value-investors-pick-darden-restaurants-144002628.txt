After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Darden Restaurants has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.67, as you can see in the chart below:View photosThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.20. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Darden Restaurants’ current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 20.39) over the past five years.View photosFurther, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 28.75. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.View photosStory continuesWe should also point out that Darden Restaurants has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 17.62, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Darden Restaurants’ stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Darden Restaurants has a P/S ratio of about 1.62. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.49 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.View photosIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Darden Restaurants currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes DRI a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Darden Restaurants is just 1.94, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2.09. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, DRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Darden Restaurants might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F. This gives DRI a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen nine estimates go lower in the past sixty days and two higher, while the full year estimate witnessed two upward and five downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has slipped 1.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has not witnessed any earnings movement. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Darden Restaurants, Inc. Price and Consensus View photosDarden Restaurants, Inc. Price and ConsensusMoreDarden Restaurants, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Darden Restaurants, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineDarden Restaurants is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (top 25% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:View photosSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Just Released: Zacks’ 7 Best Stocks for Today Experts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of +24.6% per year.These 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate breakout.See these time-sensitive tickers now >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
