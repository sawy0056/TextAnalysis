(NYSE: BHC) and Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP), the letter said.According to Left, potential buyers for RH could include French luxury goods giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (OTC: LVMUY), e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B).If Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) could fetch a "luxury premium" for its acquisition by LVMH, then RH acquisition will be a much more lucrative deal, according to Left."If tomorrow we applied the Tiffany & Co takeout multiple to RH, the stock would trade at $350," he said.RH's shares closed 1.61% higher at $212.77 on Monday.Peloton Stock Dropping To $5Left reiterated his earlier assertion that Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ: PTON) is a grossly overvalued company compared to its peers like Fitbit Inc. (NYSE: FIT) and Planet Fitness Inc. (NYSE: PLNT).The company whose shares last closed at $29.75 on Monday will be worth $5 by the end of the year, Left claimed."[Peloton CEO John Foley] should have nothing to be ashamed of as at $5 he will still have the most valuable exercise equipment company in the world," the critic wrote.Latest Ratings for RH Date Firm Action From To
