These are: Tezos (XTZ), Cosmos (ATOM), VeChain (VET) and NEO. According to data provided by Messari Pro, these coins have managed to gain an average of more than 49% against BTC in this time.As it stands, VeChain is currently leading the way after managing to gain on BTC by more than 58% in this time, where Cosmos, Tezos, and NEO are not far behind at 55%, 48.4%, and 35.5% respectively. In December, Tezos had even rallied into the top ten coins by market cap, although it has since dropped back down to fourteenth place.Comparatively, around half of the top 25 cryptocurrencies have also made gains against Bitcoin in this time, though these gains are much less pronounced. This indicates traders are beginning to favor PoS coins. Part of the reason behind this can be attributed to several major exchanges adding staking support, thereby making it much easier for investors to generate a passive income through regular staking rewards.With that said, although these PoS coins are performing well against BTC over the long term, the short-term outlook isn't as rosy, as Tezos and VeChain are both experiencing minor losses of 1-3% in the last day, whereas Cosmos and NEO are up 1.4% and 0.4% respectively.Kraken adds Tezos staking rewards, XTZ price surges 10 percentProof of stake as a concept has also been getting a significant amount of attention lately, as Ethereum (ETH)—currently the second-largest cryptocurrency—has begun transitioning to a hybrid proof-of-stake consensus system with its recent Muir Glacier hard fork. Perhaps proof of stake is about to enter its heyday.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCryptocurrency News: SEC Shuts Down Another Bitcoin ETFInvestopediaCoronavirus Hits US Stocks, Bitcoin Climbs, Haven Status UnclearCoindeskSteven Seagal settles with SEC over undisclosed bitcoin promotionsEngadgetWorld’s Top Crypto Miners Race to Roll Out Top-of-Line Machines Ahead of Bitcoin HalvingCoindeskHow bond, stock, bitcoin, and copper markets are reacting to coronavirusQuartzBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
