Epic, the most widely used and comprehensive EHR, is used by a majority of U.S. News and World Report's top-ranked hospitals and medical schools. More than 250 million patients have a medical record in Epic."We selected Epic because it will enable us to optimize patient care and give us the functionality and flexibility we need to accelerate our expansion into primary and virtual care," said Web Golinkin, CEO of FastMed. "Because so many major health systems and other providers use Epic, it will also give us the ability to integrate more fully into regional healthcare ecosystems in order to improve population health."Using Epic's patient portal, MyChart, FastMed patients will be able to access their health information, communicate with providers, schedule appointments, and pay bills using the app or webpage on their phone or computer. Additionally, Epic will support FastMed's ability to incorporate telehealth and other digital services into its care model, and to optimize its clinical and business performance through improved data analytics."We are excited to be working with FastMed, which is one of the nation's largest and most well-respected urgent care operators," said Alan Hutchison, Epic's Vice President for Population Health. "Implementing Epic will enable FastMed to give patients even easier access to high-quality, affordable healthcare and to be clinically integrated with other providers."FastMed's ability to seamlessly and securely share patient medical records with healthcare organizations across the country that already use Epic, as well as with health systems using other EHR systems, will allow FastMed's medical staff to exchange patient information quickly with surrounding hospitals and healthcare facilities. All organizations using Epic interoperate, which means they can share information to facilitate care coordination across the locations wherever patients receive care.To learn more about FastMed Urgent Care and find a clinic near you, please visit https://www.fastmed.com/.##About FastMed Urgent Care FastMed Urgent Care owns and operates 109 clinics in North Carolina, Arizona and Texas, providing a broad range of acute/episodic and preventive healthcare services 365 days per year.
