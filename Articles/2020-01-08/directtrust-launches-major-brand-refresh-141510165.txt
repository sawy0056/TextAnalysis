These new elements are the result of a year of input and collaboration to update our brand to more accurately and effectively represent the organization we’ve become over these last eight years,” stated Kathryn Ayers Wickenhauser, DirectTrust Director of Marketing and Membership. “We eagerly anticipate the culmination of these efforts in the unveiling of a new website in late February.”“Perspectives solicited from DirectTrust management, membership, and other stakeholders from within and beyond the DirectTrust community solidified the need for a brand refresh to align our visual and written presentation with the organization’s reputation,” said Tina Feldmann, Kno2 Director of Marketing Planning and Operations, serving as the DirectTrust Marketing and Membership Workgroup Co-Chair. “New elements were selected that align DirectTrust’s brand to their credibility as a pioneer, trusted governance organization, and overall expertise in the industry.
