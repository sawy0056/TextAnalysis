About 1,800 orders have been booked since its launch in November, the company said."The order rate is materially better than any other car that we have ever launched before," Palmer told Reuters.For 2019, Aston expects adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 130-140 million pounds ($171-$184 million).The company reported 247.3 million pounds in core profit a year earlier, while analysts' average forecast was 196 million pounds for 2019, according to a company-compiled consensus https://www.astonmartinlagonda.com/investors/consensus.Aston said it was also in talks with investors for a potential equity investment and would draw down $100 million in bond notes.Its shares, which have lost nearly 3 billion pounds in market value since their listing, were down 11.1% to 464.8 pence at 1136 GMT.Separately, Aston's Chief Marketing Officer Simon Sproule will be joining Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV <FCHA.MI> <FCAU.N> as the company's chief communications officer, effective Feb. 3, Fiat Chrysler said in a statement.(Reporting by Shashwat Awasthi, Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru and Costas Pitas in London; additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera; Editing by Arun Koyyur, Mark Potter and Aditya Soni)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat To Do If You're Anxious About CoronavirusHuffPost LifeThe Coolest Aston Martin Concept Ever Will Attempt a 200 MPH RunRoad & TrackAston Martin CFO departs as stock hits a record low, losses deepenAutoblogVirus Warnings Help Knock $300 Billion Off Europe StocksBloombergDaniel Craig's Stunt Driver Reveals The Secrets Behind James Bond's 'No Time To Die' Car ChasesEsquireBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
