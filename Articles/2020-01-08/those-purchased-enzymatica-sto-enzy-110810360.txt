But don't envy holders -- looking back over 5 years the returns have been really bad. In fact, the share price has declined rather badly, down some 70% in that time. So we're not so sure if the recent bounce should be celebrated. Of course, this could be the start of a turnaround. View our latest analysis for Enzymatica Enzymatica isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.Over five years, Enzymatica grew its revenue at 22% per year. That's well above most other pre-profit companies. So it's not at all clear to us why the share price sunk 21% throughout that time. You'd have to assume the market is worried that profits won't come soon enough. While there might be an opportunity here, you'd want to take a close look at the balance sheet strength.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).OM:ENZY Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Enzymatica stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?Investors should note that there's a difference between Enzymatica's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. We note that Enzymatica's TSR, at -66% is higher than its share price return of -70%. When you consider it hasn't been paying a dividend, this data suggests shareholders have benefitted from a spin-off, or had the opportunity to acquire attractively priced shares in a discounted capital raising.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Enzymatica has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 69% in the last twelve months. That certainly beats the loss of about 19% per year over the last half decade. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business.
