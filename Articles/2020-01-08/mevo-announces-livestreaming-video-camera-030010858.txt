Leveraging the cutting edge technology of Mevo’s existing video products, Mevo Start and the Mevo app are built exclusively for consumers and social media influencers of any experience level to effortlessly livestream events. The sophisticated, high-quality, all-in-one-camera features 1080p HD video and crystal clear audio that enable users to seamlessly share important events in real-time without having to separate themselves from the action. Mevo Start will be unveiled tonight in Las Vegas with live demos at Pepcom’s Digital Experience! at CES.The internet video market is projected to grow fourfold by 2022, with livestreaming leading the charge. On Facebook alone, live broadcasts have been doubling every single year since 2016. Whether it’s for work or pleasure, livestreaming has become a favored medium to connect with friends, family, colleagues and social media followers. Expensive, complex pro solutions are out of reach for the average consumer and many influencers, forcing them to rely on low-quality audio and video delivered by their smartphones, which really only work for quick snippets, or on their computers, which lack mobility.Mevo, which revolutionized long-form livestreaming for professionals with its popular Mevo Plus video camera, is now empowering consumers and influencers to take storytelling to the next level with Mevo Start. Fitting in the palm of your hand and at an affordable price point of $299, Mevo Start features a sleek, portable design and more than four hours of livestreaming battery life. With Mevo Start and its smartphone app, consumers, SMBs and influencers alike can now create high-quality HD event livestreaming videos right out of the box, enabling them to capture and share every event from start to finish, whether it’s a cooking tutorial, press conference, wedding, concert or a child’s first play.“For years, Mevo has been in the trenches pioneering high-quality camera technology that has enabled livestreaming to become the cultural phenomenon it is today,” said Max Haot, founder and CEO of Mevo. “Mevo Start continues our cutting-edge work at the forefront of livestreaming technology, and we’re confident that Mevo Start’s capabilities will unlock livestreaming for everyone, regardless of their video experience level. When it’s worth sharing, it’s worth sharing right.”Mevo Start is putting an end to the days of being trapped behind the camera by allowing users to direct their videos from a smartphone app. With just a few taps, you’re instantly connected to any streaming platform you desire – Facebook, LinkedIn, Periscope, Twitch, Twitter, Vimeo, YouTube or another channel – even multiple platforms at the same time.
