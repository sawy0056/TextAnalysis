The Resonance Best Cities rankings quantify and benchmark the relative quality of place, reputation and competitive identity for the world's principal cities with metropolitan populations of one million or more. They are lauded as the world's most thorough city ranking, based on original methodology that analyzes key statistics as well as user-generated reviews and online activity in channels such as Google, Facebook and Instagram."The World's Best Cities rankings are composed of experiential factors that people consider most important in choosing a city to live and visit, as well as empirical factors that business decision-makers consider important for business or investment," says Resonance Consultancy President & CEO Chris Fair.As a result, Resonance's Best Cities rankings don't just consider cities as places to live, work or visit—they take a more holistic approach using a wide range of factors that show positive correlations with attracting employment, investment and/or visitors — ranging from the number of culinary experiences, museums, and sights and landmarks each city offers, to the number of Global 500 corporations, direct flight connections and mentions each city has on Instagram.Based on each city's performance in the 22 factors analyzed, these are the World's Best Cities for 2020:1) London, England2) New York City, USA3) Paris, France4) Tokyo, Japan5) Moscow, Russia6) Dubai, United Arab Emirates7) Singapore, Republic of Singapore8) Barcelona, Spain9) Los Angeles, USA10) Rome, ItalyThe full ranking of the top 100 cities is available at ResonanceCo.com/Reports.ABOUT RESONANCE CONSULTANCYAs leading advisors in real estate, tourism and economic development, Resonance combines business strategy and marketing creativity to shape the future of communities, cities and countries.
