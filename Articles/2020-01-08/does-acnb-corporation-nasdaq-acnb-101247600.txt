We'll show how you can use ACNB Corporation's (NASDAQ:ACNB) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. What is ACNB's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 10.76. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying $10.76 for every $1 in prior year profit. View our latest analysis for ACNB How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for ACNB:P/E of 10.76 = $36.52 ÷ $3.39 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.How Does ACNB's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that ACNB has a lower P/E than the average (13.0) P/E for companies in the banks industry.NasdaqCM:ACNB Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreACNB's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with ACNB, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.ACNB increased earnings per share by a whopping 26% last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 15% per year over the last five years. With that performance, I would expect it to have an above average P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Is Debt Impacting ACNB's P/E?Since ACNB holds net cash of US$4.1m, it can spend on growth, justifying a higher P/E ratio than otherwise.The Bottom Line On ACNB's P/E RatioACNB has a P/E of 10.8. That's below the average in the US market, which is 18.8. The net cash position gives plenty of options to the business, and the recent improvement in EPS is good to see. The below average P/E ratio suggests that market participants don't believe the strong growth will continue.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. Although we don't have analyst forecasts shareholders might want to examine this detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.
