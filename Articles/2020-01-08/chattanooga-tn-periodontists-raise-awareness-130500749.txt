Charles Felts and Elizabeth Felts Randall of Chattanooga Periodontics and Dental Implants are spreading awareness of how oral health can affect a patient's overall health. Because poor oral health such as gum disease can lead to tooth loss, malnutrition, and serious systemic conditions, Drs. Felts and Randall offer a variety of treatments to restore oral health and improve the health of the entire body.CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Jan. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The doctors at Chattanooga Periodontics and Dental Implants, Drs. Charles Felts and Elizabeth Felts Randall, are spreading awareness about the connections the mouth has with the entire body. The mouth-body connection impacts both oral health and overall health for everyone. When the mouth is compromised by a condition such as gum disease, it can affect the entire body. These Chattanooga, TN periodontists offer multiple solutions for those seeking to improve their oral health, and thus, their full body health as well."The mouth is a connection to the whole body. Patients who have inflammatory issues like diabetes or heart disease are more prone to gum disease, and also have more severe gum disease," says Dr. Randall. "Good systemic health and good oral health work side by side with each other."The mouth is essentially an entrance to the rest of the body, so when oral health is affected by disease or tooth loss, a patient's overall health can be impacted. One of the leading oral concerns is gum disease, a progressive condition that can damage the hard and soft tissues of the mouth. When affected by gum disease, patients are more likely to have other health conditions like heart disease, stroke, or diabetes, according to research studies. Untreated gum disease can progress from the beginning stage of gingivitis to advanced periodontitis and can cause serious damage to the mouth, including tooth loss. Once gum disease is cleansed from the mouth, the bacteria will no longer spread throughout the body, thus improving the body's overall health. The symptoms of gum disease include: Constant bad breath Gum recession Tooth sensitivity Swollen or bleeding gums Loose teethPatients who are missing teeth due to gum disease or other means typically need to replace their teeth to restore full oral health. Drs. Felts and Randall are experienced at placing dental implants as a permanent tooth replacement solution. Dental implants mimic the function and appearance of natural teeth, allowing patients to have restored biting and chewing ability as well as an esthetically pleasing smile. Once dental implants are in place and restored, a patient's overall health will be able to improve as they can eat a wider variety of food and their oral health no longer is compromised.Chattanooga Periodontics and Dental Implants features a wide variety of solutions to improve the overall mouth-body connection, including laser gum disease treatment, traditional gum care, and full mouth dental implant tooth replacement options like TeethXpress®. Patients with dental anxiety can receive sedation, including advanced IV sedation to relieve discomfort during treatment and put their dental fears at ease.Those who want to protect both their whole body and oral health in Chattanooga, TN are encouraged to contact Drs.
