On the other end of the spectrum, funds are using higher fees paired with complex strategies to substantiate the increased cost.In the end, however, investors still want the lowdown on low cost for funds—active, passive or a combination of both.“Many asset managers have rolled out suites of strategic-beta ETPs to justify higher fees and to distract investors from this fundamental principle,” Johnson wrote. “In some cases, the fees charged by these funds have encroached on active management territory. Do not pay active management prices for passively managed funds.”“Fortunately, the majority of these funds are reasonably priced, and a combination of competitive forces and economies of scale has pushed some of their fees down over time,” Johnson noted.Johnson used fees charged by 197 strategic-beta products focused on strictly large-cap U.S. equities to create the histogram below. One thing worth noting is that nearly 73% of the products take an annual toll equal to or less than 0.40%--a sign of the times for lower costs.“Forty basis points is 20 times the fee levied by the lowest-cost plain-vanilla U.S. equity ETF, JPMorgan BetaBuilders U.S. Equity ETF (BBUS) , but materially lower than the 0.72% average fee of large-blend no-load mutual funds,” Johnson said. “Products falling into this range are generally sensibly priced. The remaining 27% charge fees in excess of 0.40%. These products merit an added degree of scrutiny. Any strategic-beta ETP that invests in U.S. stocks and takes a toll of 40 basis points or more should be viewed with suspicion.”For investors interested in BBUS, it seeks investment results that closely correspond to the performance of the Morningstar® US Target Market Exposure Index. The index itself is a free float adjusted market capitalization weighted index which consists of equity securities primarily traded in the United States. The underlying index targets 85% of those stocks according to market capitalization, and primarily includes large- and mid-capitalization companies.For more market trends, visit ETF Trends.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Are Markets Overdue for a Bigger Pullback?Are Chipmakers’ Massive Gains Becoming Too Frothy?BKLN: Modest Yield, High RiskFedEx Barks Back At Amazon Over Shipping LimitationsBed Bath & Beyond Does Some Holiday CleaningREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHere's What Absolent Group AB (publ)'s (STO:ABSO) P/E Is Telling UsSimply Wall St.Investors ditch market risk as stocks fall into correctionReutersInvestors in Asia Still Betting Markets Will End Higher in 2020BloombergHow investors are using ‘alternative’ data to track China’s recovery from coronaviruMarketWatchBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
