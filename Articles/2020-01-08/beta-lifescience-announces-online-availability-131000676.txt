Immune checkpoints are regulators of the immune system. These pathways are crucial for self-tolerance, which prevents the immune system from attacking cells indiscriminately. Inhibitory checkpoint molecules are targets for cancer immunotherapy due to their potential for use in multiple types of cancers. PD-1, CTLA4 and PD-L1 have been approved as checkpoint inhibitors.Beta Lifescience has produced proteins for almost 50 immune checkpoint proteins. Over the past years, our research team and scientists have been able to assemble more than 6,000 recombinant proteins for life science research needs. The proteins are rigorously tested to meet the research and development demand for excellent quality, high purity, low endotoxin and uncompromising biological activity at competitive prices.Featured Immune checkpoint proteins products list provided by Beta Lifescience includes: 4-1BB
