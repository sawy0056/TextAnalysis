This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin (EPA:ML).Our data shows Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin has a return on equity of 13% for the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every €1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn €0.13. See our latest analysis for Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin:13% = €1.6b ÷ €12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does Return On Equity Mean?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin has a similar ROE to the average in the Auto Components industry classification (13%).ENXTPA:ML Past Revenue and Net Income, January 7th 2020MoreThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. ROE can give us a view about company quality, but many investors also look to other factors, such as whether there are insiders buying shares. I will like Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin's Debt And Its 13% Return On EquityCompagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin has a debt to equity ratio of 0.60, which is far from excessive. Its very respectable ROE, combined with only modest debt, suggests the business is in good shape. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
