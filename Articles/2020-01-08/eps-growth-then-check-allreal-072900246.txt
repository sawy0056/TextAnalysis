But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like Allreal Holding (VTX:ALLN). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. View our latest analysis for Allreal Holding How Fast Is Allreal Holding Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price will eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Allreal Holding has grown EPS by 12% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). Not all of Allreal Holding's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While Allreal Holding may have maintained EBIT margins over the last year, revenue has fallen. Suffice it to say that is not a great sign of growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own Allreal Holding shares worth a considerable sum. With a whopping CHF56m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. That's certainly enough to make me think that management will be very focussed on long term growth.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalizations between CHF1.9b and CHF6.2b, like Allreal Holding, the median CEO pay is around CHF1.7m.The Allreal Holding CEO received CHF1.2m in compensation for the year ending December 2018. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given its below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Story continuesShould You Add Allreal Holding To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Allreal Holding is that it is growing profits. Earnings growth might be the main game for Allreal Holding, but the fun does not stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, I'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. Of course, just because Allreal Holding is growing does not mean it is undervalued.
