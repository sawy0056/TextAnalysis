The Company has also been granted an additional 180-day grace period, or until July 6, 2020, to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement (the "Minimum Bid Price Requirement"). The Nasdaq Capital Market operates in substantially the same manner as the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and listed companies must meet certain financial requirements and comply with Nasdaq's corporate governance requirements.

If the Company does not regain compliance during this additional grace period, its common stock would be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. As part of its transfer application, the Company notified Nasdaq that if the stock price does not recover sufficiently during the additional grace period, it intends to take actions to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, including by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.About Stein Mart Stein Mart, Inc. is a national specialty omni off-price retailer offering designer and name-brand fashion apparel for him, for her and now for Kids!, home décor, accessories and shoes at everyday discount prices. Stein Mart provides real value that customers love every day.
