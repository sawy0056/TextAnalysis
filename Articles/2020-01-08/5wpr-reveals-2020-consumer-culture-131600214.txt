Busch. "These insights allow us to better guide our clients to make smart decisions because we now have a deeper understanding of the purchasing power of each generation."The research shows a special focus on Millennials, who are estimated to spend 1.4 trillion in 2020. This age group emerged as the most impulsive and the most highly influenced generation, with 82% of Millennials purchasing an item the first time they see it if they like it enough.When it comes to corporate image, the report dives into the pros and cons of brand activism and cause marketing, showing an overwhelming positive response to companies with a higher brand purpose. The research shows that 83% of Millennials find it important for the companies they buy from to align with their values."We're going to see huge growth in cause marketing in 2020," predicts 5WPR Founder and CEO, Ronn Torossian. "71% of Millennials will pay more for a product if they know some of the proceeds go to charity, meaning brands have the opportunity to create a positive corporate identity and increase sales if done correctly."On the digital side, the report looks at social media and the impact that influencers and advertising have on users. Although Facebook reigned supreme as the number one social media platform across all age groups, Instagram emerged the most effective, as 94% of people influenced by Instagram have clicked, shared or purchased a product seen on their feed. Interestingly enough, while social media is no doubt still driving sales, 68% OF MILLENNIALS (58% of consumers) still prefer finding new products in store to finding them online, proving that retail is far from dead.As a leading consumer PR firm, and an award-winning digital agency, 5WPR is committed to being a trailblazer in the industry and providing clients with the most up-to-date insights.
