(NASDAQ:LMB) At US$3.77?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 7, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosLimbach Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LMB), which is in the construction business, and is based in United States, received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQCM over the last few months. As a small cap stock, hardly covered by any analysts, there is generally more of an opportunity for mispricing as there is less activity to push the stock closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity here to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Limbach Holdings’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Limbach Holdings What's the opportunity in Limbach Holdings?According to my relative valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Limbach Holdings’s ratio of 47.67x is above its peer average of 17.59x, which suggests the stock is overvalued compared to the Construction industry. Another thing to keep in mind is that Limbach Holdings’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Limbach Holdings generate?NasdaqCM:LMB Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
