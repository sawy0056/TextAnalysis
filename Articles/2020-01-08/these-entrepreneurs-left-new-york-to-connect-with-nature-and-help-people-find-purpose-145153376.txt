Two generations ago, in fact.The couple moved to San Diego from New York and are now on the verge of launching a business. They want to provide people with the opportunity to focus on dormant passion projects away from the hustle and bustle of daily life and its many attachments. “We want to create tiny homes that are off the grid, for people to cultivate an interest or a passion,” Bertles said. “To get you back to what really is bringing you meaning in your life.” Their business plan was heavily influenced by their shared interest in sustainability and minimalism, passions they each trace back to their grandparents. Bertles’ grandmother instilled in her the importance of not wasting anything, while Antrim-Cashin’s grandfather developed land, inspiring him to think of other ways land can be developed to help people realize their dreams in a sustainable way. As they think about the future, the couple wants to instill similar values in their own children. “If I raised a child who is inquisitive and can appreciate the world around them, I would be so proud of that child,” Bortles said. To see the story of how the two met and eventually built a life in San Diego together, including a shared financial life to support their fledgling business, watch the video above.
