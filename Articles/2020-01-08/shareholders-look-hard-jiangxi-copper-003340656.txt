Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Jiangxi Copper:0.059 = CN¥3.6b ÷ (CN¥133b - CN¥72b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Jiangxi Copper has an ROCE of 5.9%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Given the industry it operates in, Jiangxi Copper could be considered cyclical.

Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Jiangxi Copper has total assets of CN¥133b and current liabilities of CN¥72b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 54% of its total assets. With a high level of current liabilities, Jiangxi Copper will experience a boost to its ROCE.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Jiangxi Copper's ROCENotably, it also has a mediocre ROCE, which to my mind is not an appealing combination.
