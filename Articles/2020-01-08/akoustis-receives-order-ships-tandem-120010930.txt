Each of the Akoustis XBAW™ 5 GHz filters are up to 23 times smaller than incumbent technologies including dielectric resonator (DR) ceramic filters.The customer is a leading enterprise-focused WiFi OEM that has previously evaluated Akoustis’ 5.2 GHz filter for use in tri-band WiFi MU-MIMO designs and is now evaluating the 5.2 GHz and 5.6 GHz coexistence filters. The samples shipped provide this OEM its first opportunity to evaluate the 5.6 GHz filter which Akoustis completed in the September 2019 quarter. If the evaluation is successful, the customer is targeting MU-MIMO WiFi products that would include the tandem filter solution once final qualification is achieved.This marks the fifth WiFi customer currently evaluating Akoustis’ patented tandem WiFi filter solution for potential use in a future commercial product.Jeff Shealy, Founder and CEO of Akoustis, stated, “Our 5 GHz XBAW™ micro-filter solution continues to see growing interest as we move closer to securing design wins and commencing commercial production for multiple customers.” Mr. Shealy continued, “The Company continues to expand its sales funnel of near-term revenue opportunities for high-band, high-performance XBAW™ filters for the defense, WiFi, 5G infrastructure and 5G mobile markets, providing us with diversification with respect to design wins and timing of commercial production.”The 5.2 GHz and 5.6 GHz WiFi filters are manufactured using the Company’s patented XBAW™ process and manufactured in the Company’s Si-MEMS Wafer Fab located in Canandaigua, NY.Akoustis has introduced several new filters over the past twelve months including a 5.6 GHz WiFi filter, a 5.2 GHz WiFi filter, a 4.9 GHz band n79 filter for small cell network infrastructure, a 3.8 GHz filter and five S-Band filters for defense phased-array radar applications, a 3.6 GHz filter for the CBRS infrastructure market and band 25 downlink and uplink filters for LTE infrastructure. The Company is also developing several new filters for the sub-7 GHz bands targeting 5G mobile device, network infrastructure, WiFi CPE and defense markets.About Akoustis Technologies, Inc.Akoustis® (www.akoustis.com) is a high-tech BAW RF filter solutions company that is pioneering next-generation materials science and MEMS wafer manufacturing to address the market requirements for improved RF filters - targeting higher bandwidth, higher operating frequencies and higher output power compared to incumbent polycrystalline BAW technology deployed today. The Company utilizes its proprietary XBAW manufacturing process to produce bulk acoustic wave RF filters for mobile and other wireless markets, which facilitate signal acquisition and accelerate band performance between the antenna and digital back end. Superior performance is driven by the significant advances of high-purity, single-crystal and associated piezoelectric materials and the resonator-filter process technology which drives electro-mechanical coupling and translates to wide filter bandwidth. Akoustis plans to service the fast growing multi-billion-dollar RF filter market using its integrated device manufacturer (IDM) business model. The Company owns and operates a 120,000 sq. ft. ISO-9001:2015 certified commercial wafer-manufacturing facility located in Canandaigua, NY, which includes a class 100 / class 1000 cleanroom facility - tooled for 150-mm diameter wafers - for the design, development, fabrication and packaging of RF filters, MEMS and other semiconductor devices.  Akoustis Technologies, Inc. is headquartered in the Piedmont technology corridor near Charlotte, North Carolina.Story continuesForward-Looking StatementsThis document includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended to be covered by the “safe harbor” created by those sections. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans or strategies for the future (including our possible future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential market opportunities and the effects of competition), and the assumptions underlying such statements.
