(NASDAQ:OSUR) to see whether it might be an attractive investment prospect. Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for OraSure Technologies:0.068 = US$21m ÷ (US$339m - US$29m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, OraSure Technologies has an ROCE of 6.8%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Do OraSure Technologies's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Short term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.OraSure Technologies has total assets of US$339m and current liabilities of US$29m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 8.5% of its total assets. OraSure Technologies has a low level of current liabilities, which have a minimal impact on its uninspiring ROCE.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On OraSure Technologies's ROCEIf performance improves, then OraSure Technologies may be an OK investment, especially at the right valuation.
