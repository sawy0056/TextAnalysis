(NASDAQ:LONE) to determine whether it could have potential as an investment idea. In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Lonestar Resources US:0.16 = US$114m ÷ (US$780m - US$69m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Lonestar Resources US has an ROCE of 16%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Remember that most companies like Lonestar Resources US are cyclical businesses. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Lonestar Resources US's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCEShort term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Lonestar Resources US has total assets of US$780m and current liabilities of US$69m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 8.9% of its total assets. In addition to low current liabilities (making a negligible impact on ROCE), Lonestar Resources US earns a sound return on capital employed.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Lonestar Resources US's ROCEIf it is able to keep this up, Lonestar Resources US could be attractive.
