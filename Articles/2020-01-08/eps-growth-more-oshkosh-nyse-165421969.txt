Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. See our latest analysis for Oshkosh How Fast Is Oshkosh Growing?As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). It's no surprise, then, that I like to invest in companies with EPS growth. Who among us would not applaud Oshkosh's stratospheric annual EPS growth of 41%, compound, over the last three years? While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches my attention; like a crow with a sparkly stone.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). Oshkosh maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 8.8% to US$8.4b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Oshkosh's forecast profits?Are Oshkosh Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Oshkosh has a market capitalization of US$6.4b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a small fortune of shares, currently valued at US$65m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to make me think that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Is Oshkosh Worth Keeping An Eye On?Oshkosh's earnings per share have taken off like a rocket aimed right at the moon. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders certainly brightens my view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So yes, on this short analysis I do think it's worth considering Oshkosh for a spot on your watchlist. If you think Oshkosh might suit your style as an investor, you could go straight to its annual report, or you could first check our discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for the company.Of course, you can do well (sometimes) buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.
