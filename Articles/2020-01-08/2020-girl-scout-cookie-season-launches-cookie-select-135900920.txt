Nine in ten Girl Scouts say the cookie program has built their entrepreneurship skills and their interest in pursuing entrepreneurship as a career path—so every cookie purchase is an investment in the world-changing business leaders of tomorrow. What's more, each and every purchase stays local to power amazing experiences and leadership opportunities for girls in communities across the United States.GSUSA's refreshed cookie packaging (with the same great taste!) continues to emphasize what the cookie program is all about, and the updated images feature current Girl Scouts taking part in a diverse range of experiences available to members—from adventure-packed camping and canoeing, to exploring space science and designing robots, to taking action to improve their communities. Every purchase of Girl Scout Cookies makes experiences like these possible for girls in your local community.The new Girl Scout Cookie is Lemon-Ups ™, a crispy lemon cookie baked with messages inspired by Girl Scout entrepreneurs. "I am a go-getter" and "I am an innovator" are among the eight phrases that bring the experience of Girl Scouting to life. The variety replaces the Savannah Smiles® cookie in markets where it was offered, joining the national lineup that also includes the Lemonades® cookie, savory slices of shortbread with lemon-flavored icing. Each of the two varieties is offered in select Girl Scout council markets, ensuring all consumers have access to a delicious lemon Girl Scout Cookie for as long as supplies last."Everyone loves Girl Scout Cookies—but the program is about so much more than cookies," said GSUSA CEO Sylvia Acevedo. "Girls learn about entrepreneurship as they run their own cookie businesses. The important business and financial literacy skills girls learn through the program are proven to build their leadership skills and position them for success in the future. When you purchase cookies you are helping girls power their Girl Scout experience and you're supporting female entrepreneurs."Girl Scout Cookies can only be purchased from a registered Girl Scout.
