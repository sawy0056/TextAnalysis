It expects the newer technology to account for 50% of revenue by 2021, up from about 30% in 2018."We plan to build systems to mass-produce OLED products in our Chinese factory by end of the first quarter this year," Jeong said.He said the company was not planning to shift the LCD TV production lines marked for closure in South Korea into OLED panel production.LG's cross-town rival Samsung Display, a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS>, said in October it had suspended one of its LCD production lines in South Korea.It also announced a 13.1 trillion won ($11.25 billion) investment in facilities and research to upgrade a production line.($1 = 1,164.1500 won)(Reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Jan Harvey)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergGlobal coronavirus cases rise as China’s downward trend continuesPA Media: World NewsBTS cancel concerts as South Korea coronavirus cases pass 2,000AFPHyundai suspends output at one factory after worker tests positive for coronavirus - sourceReutersThe 6 largest coronavirus outbreaks outside of ChinaCBS NewsBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
