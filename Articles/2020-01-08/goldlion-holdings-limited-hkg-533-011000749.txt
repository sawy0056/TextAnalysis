How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.With Goldlion Holdings yielding 7.9% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Goldlion Holdings for its dividend - read on to learn more. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Goldlion Holdings! SEHK:533 Historical Dividend Yield, January 7th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Goldlion Holdings paid out 49% of its profit as dividends. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Goldlion Holdings paid out 95% of its free cash flow last year, which we think is concerning if cash flows do not improve. Goldlion Holdings paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Goldlion Holdings to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Goldlion Holdings's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Goldlion Holdings's latest financial position,

For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Goldlion Holdings's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was HK$0.18 in 2010, compared to HK$0.18 last year. Its dividends have grown at less than 1% per annum over this time frame.Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. In the last five years, Goldlion Holdings's earnings per share have shrunk at approximately 2.3% per annum. If earnings continue to decline, the dividend may come under pressure. Every investor should make an assessment of whether the company is taking steps to stabilise the situation.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Goldlion Holdings has a low payout ratio, which we like, although it paid out virtually all of its generated cash. It's not great to see earnings per share shrinking. The dividends have been relatively consistent, but we wonder for how much longer this will be true. While we're not hugely bearish on it, overall we think there are potentially better dividend stocks than Goldlion Holdings out there.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Goldlion Holdings stock.
