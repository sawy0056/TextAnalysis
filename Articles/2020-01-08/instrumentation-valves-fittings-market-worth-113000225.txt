Valves and fittings used in the oil & gas industry should be able to withstand harsh environmental conditions. As a result, maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) activities are crucial for valves used in the oil & gas industry. Oil & gas is a cyclical industry; hence, players of this industry procure instrumentation valves and fittings to minimize dependency on suppliers. Over the past few years, oil & gas products have witnessed strong demand from developing nations. Such continuously increasing demand for oil and gas products is expected to drive the instrumentation valves and fittings market."Market for valves to grow at highest CAGR from 2019 to 2025"Valves play a crucial role in the growth of the instrumentation valves and fittings market. Ball valves are used extensively owing to their low pressure drop and the ability to open and close quickly. These valves are used in various transmission, storage, and gas processing applications across industries. Check valves are mainly used in wastewater, portable water, and irrigation applications; these valves also find use in process, mining, food & beverages, oil & gas, and pharmaceuticals industries. The growing use of instrumentation valves in various end-user industries, including oil & gas, healthcare, and chemicals, is fueling the growth of the valves market. As a result, the valves offerings segment is expected to grow at a higher CAGR during the forecast period.Browse in-depth TOC on "Instrumentation Valves and Fittings Market"66 – Tables 71 – Figures 120 – Pages "Stainless steel material to dominate instrumentation valves and fittings market during forecast period"The instrumentation valves and fittings industry is expected to witness limited product development and innovation in the coming years.
