How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.With a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if ZCCM Investments Holdings is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. We'd agree the yield does look enticing. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying ZCCM Investments Holdings for its dividend - read on to learn more. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ENXTPA:MLZAM Historical Dividend Yield, January 7th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. ZCCM Investments Holdings paid out of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Unfortunately, while ZCCM Investments Holdings pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note ZCCM Investments Holdings's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.We update our data on ZCCM Investments Holdings every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Looking at the data, we can see that ZCCM Investments Holdings has been paying a dividend for the past five years. During the past five-year period, the first annual payment was K1.56 in 2015, compared to K0.61 last year. The dividend has fallen 61% over that period.A shrinking dividend over a five-year period is not ideal, and we'd be concerned about investing in a dividend stock that lacks a solid record of growing dividends per share.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. ZCCM Investments Holdings's EPS have fallen by approximately 30% per year during the past five years. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and ZCCM Investments Holdings's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that ZCCM Investments Holdings's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Firstly, the company has a conservative payout ratio, although we'd note that its cashflow in the past year was substantially lower than its reported profit. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and its dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Overall, ZCCM Investments Holdings falls short in several key areas here. Unless the investor has strong grounds for an alternative conclusion, we find it hard to get interested in a dividend stock with these characteristics.Story continuesAre management backing themselves to deliver performance?
