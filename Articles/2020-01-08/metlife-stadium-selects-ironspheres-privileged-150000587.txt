"We selected Ironsphere after an exhaustive search."It was evident after thorough testing that the PAM solution and related features from Ironsphere met MetLife Stadium's current and future requirements, including securing privileged access to network infrastructure, tracking changes in configurations, providing automated services integrated with Active Directory to streamline processes, enforcing least privilege centrally across entire network infrastructure in real-time, and requiring Multi Factor Authentication across the entire network infrastructure even if the target systems did not support MFA."It's been an honor for our team to work alongside MetLife Stadium's world class IT and network operations teams to balance security with productivity," said Michael Fritzlo, Executive Chairman of Ironsphere. "We were able to preserve the user experience, making it possible for users to continue to use their native clients, and transformed the experience of security audits with human readable log records and centrally managing who has access to which system. More security, more simplicity – this is our winning combination."MetLife Stadium's team was initially looking for a TACACS server, but after evaluating their options chose Ironsphere because the platform and software support video records of sessions (via SSH proxy module), is ready to secure and rotate privileged credentials in a vault, supports SSH key management and secures third-party access with temporary accounts, live session watching and web based CLI access interface to network systems.About Ironsphere Ironsphere is a software company established in 2016, providing advanced technology software in the fields of Access Control Systems, Privileged Task Automation and Next-generation Security and Audit.
