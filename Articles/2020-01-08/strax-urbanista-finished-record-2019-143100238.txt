Total sales in 2019 amounted to MSEK 240 compared to MSEK 141 the previous year, corresponding to a growth of 70 percent.Urbanista experienced growth from all sales channels in 2019 where e-commerce particularly stuck out with more than 1 000 percent growth from direct website sales following a focused and aggressive strategy, including onboarding of a completely new team to implement and maximize the e-commerce opportunity.The growth both online and offline was made possible due to a strong portfolio of products, especially within the true wireless headphone segment, where Urbanista launched three products during 2019. Counterpoint Research expects the true wireless headphone market to grow by 80% CAGR for 2019-2022 and Urbanista is well positioned to be on that curve."We have managed to significantly grow Urbanista every year since STRAX acquired the brand in 2014, however, it feels like 2019 was the year when it all came together with relevant and timely product launches followed by success in both online and offline sales channels. Social media presence and e-commerce is of utmost importance for the brand and I am very impressed with the strategic execution of our digital marketing team as well as how the entire Urbanista organization coped with the challenges that come along with significant growth. With a solid portfolio of true wireless headphones and a promising roadmap, including an ANC product showcased today at CES, I am very confident the success will continue and it furthermore gives me good comfort that the organization has proven to have what it takes to deliver in a high growth environment." says Gudmundur Palmason, CEO, STRAX AB.For further information please contact Gudmundur Palmason, CEO, STRAX AB, +46-8-545-017-50.About UrbanistaUrbanista make audio products rooted in Scandinavian design.
