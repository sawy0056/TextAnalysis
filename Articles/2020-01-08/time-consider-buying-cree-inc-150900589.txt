(NASDAQ:CREE)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 7, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosCree, Inc. (NASDAQ:CREE), which is in the semiconductor business, and is based in United States, received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$51.08 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$42.57. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Cree's current trading price of US$46.19 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Cree’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Cree Is Cree still cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19.65% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Cree today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $38.61, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading.

This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder?
