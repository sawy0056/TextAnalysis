Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.With a eight-year payment history and a 3.7% yield, many investors probably find HAEMATO intriguing. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding HAEMATO for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on HAEMATO! XTRA:HAE Historical Dividend Yield, January 7th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Although it reported a loss over the past 12 months, HAEMATO currently pays a dividend. When a company recently reported a loss, we should investigate if its cash flows covered the dividend.HAEMATO paid out 160% of its free cash flow last year, which we think is concerning if cash flows do not improve. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely.Is HAEMATO's Balance Sheet Risky?Given HAEMATO is paying a dividend but reported a loss over the past year, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. HAEMATO has net debt of 0.62 times its EBITDA, which is generally an okay level of debt for most companies.We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. HAEMATO has EBIT of 10.39 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.Consider getting
our latest analysis on HAEMATO's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Looking at the last decade of data, we can see that HAEMATO paid its first dividend at least eight years ago. It's good to see that HAEMATO has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. During the past eight-year period, the first annual payment was €0.17 in 2012, compared to €0.10 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 6.2% a year during that period. HAEMATO's dividend hasn't shrunk linearly at 6.2% per annum, but the CAGR is a useful estimate of the historical rate of change.Story continuesA shrinking dividend over a eight-year period is not ideal, and we'd be concerned about investing in a dividend stock that lacks a solid record of growing dividends per share.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, and a poor history of shrinking dividends, it's even more important to see if EPS are growing. It's not great to see that HAEMATO's have fallen at approximately 8.0% over the past five years. Declining earnings per share over a number of years is not a great sign for the dividend investor. Without some improvement, this does not bode well for the long term value of a company's dividend.We'd also point out that HAEMATO issued a meaningful number of new shares in the past year. Trying to grow the dividend when issuing new shares reminds us of the ancient Greek tale of Sisyphus - perpetually pushing a boulder uphill. Companies that consistently issue new shares are often suboptimal from a dividend perspective.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. It's a concern to see that the company paid a dividend despite reporting a loss, and the dividend was also not well covered by free cash flow. Earnings per share have been falling, and the company has cut its dividend at least once in the past. From a dividend perspective, this is a cause for concern. In this analysis, HAEMATO doesn't shape up too well as a dividend stock. We'd find it hard to look past the flaws, and would not be inclined to think of it as a reliable dividend-payer.Are management backing themselves to deliver performance?
