Each of the six 2019 Power Partners were recently recognized at individual award ceremonies.Hunt received the award for the solar panels installed on 284 homes at Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, S.C. In collaboration with Duke Energy, Hunt installed 1,350 kilowatts DC (kWdc) of generating capacity that is helping reduce utility bills for the housing project. Duke Energy performed extensive feeder studies to ensure that the solar panels integrated well into our system. The project was enabled by a Duke Energy rebate of more than $1 million."This is a great example of Hunt's internal capabilities as well as our commitment to our external partnerships with the Air Force, Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), Shaw base leadership, and Duke Energy," said John Hoyt, Vice President for Hunt Military Communities. "Moreover, this project is helping to offset approximately 40% of the total annual electrical consumption at Shaw Military Housing and all of those savings are kept at the project and will benefit the sustainment of the houses for our airman." "This is part of our ongoing effort to support the U.S. Air Force in meeting its long-term energy goals across the country," explained Abe Weiner, Vice President at Hunt. "The Shaw Solar project exemplifies how public-private partnerships are able to enhance energy sustainability and resiliency greatly."  Other award-winning organizations included: Walmart Stores, multiple locationsCategory: Solution Innovations, EnterpriseCape Fear Community College, Wilmington, N.C.Category: Storm RestorationLake Wales Care Center, Lake Wales, Fla.Category: Community ExcellenceFirst Quality Tissue, Anderson, S.C.Category: Economic DevelopmentBon Secours, St. Petersburg, Fla.Category: Solution Innovation, Mid-Market"The businesses and organizations selected for this award are truly outstanding," said Chris Edge, Duke Energy vice president of large business customers.
