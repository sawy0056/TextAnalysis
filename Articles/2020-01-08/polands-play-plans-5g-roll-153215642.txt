The entire city is covered."The roll-out of 5G has proved controversial with the United States pressing its allies not to use equipment from Chinese telecoms firm Huawei, citing concerns Beijing could use the equipment for spying.Harion said Play's 5G network in Gdynia would be based on Huawei equipment, while Cyfrowy Polsat will use technology from Nokia and Ericsson.Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations and industry players have warned that excluding Huawei could slow down the implementation of 5G and make it more expensive.Play also said on Tuesday that it planned to build another 800 base stations in 2020, bringing its total to 8700.Play also competes in Poland with Orange Polska and T-Mobile, a unit of Deutsche Telekom.(Reporting by Anna Koper, writing by Alan Charlish; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
