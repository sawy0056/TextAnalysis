The samples taken illustrate high grade gold (Au) and silver (Ag) assay results at two new areas that could significantly extend the known mineralization on the Pilar property. Among the assay results are values up to 9.3 g/t Au and 76.4 g/t Ag at the south-east part of the property, and up to 323 g/t Ag and 0.5 g/t Au midway along the eastern portion of the property. Samples taken in these areas follow up a prominent gold and silver anomaly identified in a soil sample survey in 2018.In addition, Tocvan conducted a check of the location of the S-10 drill intercept from the mid 1990's which returned 53.47 g/t Au and 53.4 g/t Ag over 16.5m . The drill intercept location was estimated and then projected to surface where a dark red hematite sheared outcrop was located, uncovered and sampled. Among the assays returned was a sample of 3.8 g/t Au and 57.4 g/t Ag showing mineralizing fluid flow in the structures.A full map illustrating the samples taken in November 2018 at Pilar can be viewed in Tocvan's news release dated January 7 th, 2020.The technical information in this news release has been prepared by Mark T.
