To keep it practical, we'll show how Playmates Holdings Limited's (HKG:635) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Playmates Holdings has a price to earnings ratio of 5.03, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 19.9%. Check out our latest analysis for Playmates Holdings How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Playmates Holdings:P/E of 5.03 = HK$1.17 ÷ HK$0.23 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Playmates Holdings Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Playmates Holdings has a lower P/E than the average (8.0) in the leisure industry classification.SEHK:635 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreThis suggests that market participants think Playmates Holdings will underperform other companies in its industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Playmates Holdings's earnings per share grew by -9.1% in the last twelve months. But earnings per share are down 9.0% per year over the last five years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Playmates Holdings's Balance SheetWith net cash of HK$961m, Playmates Holdings has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 38% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On Playmates Holdings's P/E RatioPlaymates Holdings has a P/E of 5.0. That's below the average in the HK market, which is 10.7. Earnings improved over the last year. And the net cash position gives the company many options. So it's strange that the low P/E indicates low expectations.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
