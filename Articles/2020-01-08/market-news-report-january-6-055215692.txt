The last days of 2019 brought pull-back in stocks, oil and an advance in gold. The data releases were mixed, so it was all about year’s end “window dressing” trading action. Then came the first trading day of 2020 – Thursday, January 3. The economic data releases came out along with expectations pushing risk-on assets prices much higher. But later in the day news from Iraq significantly lowered investors’ sentiment. Friday’s economic data releases seemed less relevant, as everyone’s attention drifted towards the Middle East news.The week aheadWhat about the coming week? We will certainly see more U.S. – Iran/Iraq conflict updates that will affect the markets in the near future. What about the scheduled economic data releases? The most important news will be Friday’s monthly jobs data release in the U.S., preceded by Wednesday’s ADP number. We will also have the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and inflation data from the Eurozone on Tuesday. The forex traders will likely pay attention to this week’s series of economic data releases from Australia. There will also be the Bank of Canada Governor Poloz speech on Thursday followed by Friday’s monthly jobs data release in Canada. Let’s take a look at key highlights:• Friday’s U.S. Non-farm Payrolls along with the Unemployment Rate will be the most important economic data releases in the coming week. • The mentioned monthly jobs data release will be preceded by Wednesday’s ADP Non-Farm Employment Change release. • On Tuesday we will get the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and the Eurozone’s CPI number. • On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday there will be some important economic data releases from Australia, and on Thursday and Friday we will await the releases from Canada.You will find this week’s the key news releases below (EST time zone). For your convenience, we broken them down per market to which they are particularly important, so that you know what to pay extra attention to, if you have or plan to have positions in one of them. Moreover, we put the particularly important news in bold. This kind of news is what is more likely to trigger volatile movements. The news that are not in bold usually don’t result in bigger intraday moves, so unless one is engaging in a particularly active form of day trading, it might be best to focus on the news that we put in bold. Of course, you are free to use the below indications as you see fit. As far as we are concerned, we are usually not engaging in any day trading during days with “bold” events on a given market. However, in case of more medium-term trades, we usually choose to be aware of the increased intraday volatility, but not change the currently opened position.Our Market News Report consists of two different time-related perspectives. The investors’ perspective is only suitable for the long-term investments. The single economic data releases rarely cause major outlook changes. Hence, we will only see a handful of bold markings every week. On the other hand, the traders’ perspective is for traders and day-traders, because the assets’ prices are likely to react on a single piece of economic data. So, there will be a lot more bold markings on potentially market-moving news every week.Investors’ PerspectiveStory continuesGold, Silver, and Mining StocksTuesday, January 7 • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – ISM Non-Manufacturing PMIWednesday, January 8 • 8:15 a.m. U.S. – ADP Non-Farm Employment ChangeFriday, January 10 • 8:30 a.m. U.S. – Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate • 8:30 a.m. Canada – Employment Change, Unemployment RateCrude OilTuesday, January 7 • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI • 4:30 p.m. U.S. – API Weekly Crude Oil StockWednesday, January 8 • 8:15 a.m. U.S. – ADP Non-Farm Employment Change • 10:30 a.m. U.S. – Crude Oil InventoriesFriday, January 10 • 8:30 a.m. U.S. – Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate • 8:30 a.m. Canada – Employment Change, Unemployment RateStock MarketsMonday, January 6 • 9:45 a.m. U.S. – Final Services PMITuesday, January 7 • 5:00 a.m. Eurozone – CPI Flash Estimate y/y • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – ISM Non-Manufacturing PMIWednesday, January 8 • 8:15 a.m. U.S. – ADP Non-Farm Employment ChangeFriday, January 10 • 8:30 a.m. U.S. – Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment RateEUR/USDMonday, January 6 • 4:00 a.m. Eurozone – Final Services PMI • 4:30 a.m. Eurozone – Sentix Investor Confidence • 5:00 a.m. Eurozone – PPI m/m • 9:45 a.m. U.S. – Final Services PMITuesday, January 7 • 5:00 a.m. Eurozone – CPI Flash Estimate y/y, Core CPI Flash Estimate y/y, Italian Preliminary CPI m/m, Retail Sales m/m • 8:30 a.m. U.S. -Trade Balance • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – ISM Non-Manufacturing PMIWednesday, January 8 • 8:15 a.m. U.S. – ADP Non-Farm Employment Change • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Brainard SpeechThursday, January 9 • 5:00 a.m. Eurozone – Unemployment Rate • 8:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Clarida Speech • 11:30 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Williams Speech • 2:10 p.m. Eurozone – German Buba President Weidmann SpeechFriday, January 10 • 8:30 a.m. U.S. – Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment RateUSD/JPYMonday, January 6 • 9:45 a.m. U.S. – Final Services PMITuesday, January 7 • 8:30 a.m. U.S. -Trade Balance • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – ISM Non-Manufacturing PMIWednesday, January 8 • 0:00 a.m. Japan – Consumer Confidence • 8:15 a.m. U.S. – ADP Non-Farm Employment Change • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Brainard SpeechThursday, January 9 • 8:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Clarida Speech • 11:30 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Williams SpeechFriday, January 10 • 8:30 a.m. U.S. – Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment RateGBP/USDMonday, January 6 • 4:30 a.m. U.K. – Final Services PMI • 9:45 a.m. U.S. – Final Services PMITuesday, January 7 • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – ISM Non-Manufacturing PMIWednesday, January 8 • 8:15 a.m. U.S. – ADP Non-Farm Employment Change • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Brainard SpeechThursday, January 9 • 8:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Clarida Speech • 11:30 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Williams SpeechFriday, January 10 • 8:30 a.m. U.S. – Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment RateUSD/CADMonday, January 6 • 8:30 a.m. Canada – RMPI m/m, IPPI m/m • 9:45 a.m. U.S. – Final Services PMITuesday, January 7 • 8:30 a.m. Canada – Trade Balance • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI • 10:00 a.m. Canada – Ivey PMIWednesday, January 8 • 8:15 a.m. U.S. – ADP Non-Farm Employment Change • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Brainard SpeechThursday, January 9 • 8:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Clarida Speech • 8:15 a.m. Canada – Housing Starts • 8:30 a.m. Canada – Building Permits m/m • 2:00 p.m. Canada – BOC Governor Poloz SpeechFriday, January 10 • 8:30 a.m. U.S. – Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate • 8:30 a.m. Canada – Employment Change, Unemployment RateAUD/USDTuesday, January 7 • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI • 7:30 p.m. Australia – Building Approvals m/mWednesday, January 8 • 8:15 a.m. U.S. – ADP Non-Farm Employment Change • 10:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Brainard Speech • 7:30 p.m. Australia – Trade BalanceThursday, January 9 • 8:00 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Clarida Speech • 11:30 a.m. U.S. – FOMC Member Williams Speech • 7:30 p.m. Australia – Retail Sales m/mFriday, January 10 • 8:30 a.m. U.S. – Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment RateWe hope you enjoyed reading the above free analysis, and we encourage you to read today’s Market News Report – this analysis’ full version.
