But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So consider, for a moment, the misfortune of Ourgame International Holdings Limited (HKG:6899) investors who have held the stock for three years as it declined a whopping 87%. That would certainly shake our confidence in the decision to own the stock. The more recent news is of little comfort, with the share price down 49% in a year. Furthermore, it's down 44% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.We really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio. Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson. See our latest analysis for Ourgame International Holdings Ourgame International Holdings wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.Over the last three years, Ourgame International Holdings's revenue dropped 41% per year. That means its revenue trend is very weak compared to other loss making companies. The swift share price decline at an annual compound rate of 49%, reflects this weak fundamental performance. We prefer leave it to clowns to try to catch falling knives, like this stock. It's worth remembering that investors call buying a steeply falling share price 'catching a falling knife' because it is a dangerous pass time.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).SEHK:6899 Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreIf you are thinking of buying or selling Ourgame International Holdings stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Ourgame International Holdings had a tough year, with a total loss of 49%, against a market gain of about 12%.
