The laptop is the second-generation HP Elite Dragonfly with built-in Tile tracker that sends alerts to users when the device is misplaced or lost. Further, it is the first device to be made with ocean-bound plastic material, having more than 82% of the mechanical parts fashioned out of recycled materials.Additionally, the company launched a redesigned HP Spectre x360 15, making it its most powerful 15-inch convertible. This Spectre can be powered by up to 10th Gen Intel INTC Core i7processor with NVIDIA NVDA GeForce graphics. The device which packs a 15.6-inch 4K OLED display or 4K IPS display promises a battery life of up to 17 hours and nearly three times faster file transfer speed with Wi-Fi 6 connectivity.Further, for security and privacy purposes, the device comes with the HP Webcam Kill Switch, a dedicated mute mic button, a fingerprint reader, Express VPN and LastPass.HP also announced the new Envy 32 All-in-One desktop, which is the first all-in-one PC with Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics.Moreover, two docking displays, namely E24d G4 and E27d G4 Advanced Docking Monitors, were introduced.
