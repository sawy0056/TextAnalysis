But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock is up an impressive 222% over the last five years. It's also good to see the share price up 12% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 13% in 90 days). Check out our latest analysis for Activision Blizzard While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Activision Blizzard achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 26% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).NasdaqGS:ATVI Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Activision Blizzard's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Activision Blizzard the TSR over the last 5 years was 234%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveActivision Blizzard provided a TSR of 21% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 27% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing.
