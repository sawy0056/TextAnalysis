ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Fabasoft's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCECurrent liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months.
