Anyone who held NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:NCSM) over the last year knows what a loser feels like. To wit the share price is down 66% in that time. Because NCS Multistage Holdings hasn't been listed for many years, the market is still learning about how the business performs. Even worse, it's down 8.5% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. View our latest analysis for NCS Multistage Holdings NCS Multistage Holdings wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.NCS Multistage Holdings's revenue didn't grow at all in the last year. In fact, it fell 10%. That looks pretty grim, at a glance. In the absence of profits, it's not unreasonable that the share price fell 66%. Having said that, if growth is coming in the future, the stock may have better days ahead. We don't generally like to own companies with falling revenues and no profits, so we're pretty cautious of this one, at the moment.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:NCSM Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think NCS Multistage Holdings will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).A Different PerspectiveGiven that the market gained 29% in the last year, NCS Multistage Holdings shareholders might be miffed that they lost 66%. While the aim is to do better than that, it's worth recalling that even great long-term investments sometimes underperform for a year or more. With the stock down 5.1% over the last three months, the market doesn't seem to believe that the company has solved all its problems. Basically, most investors should be wary of buying into a poor-performing stock, unless the business itself has clearly improved.
