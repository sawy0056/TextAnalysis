When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. That downside risk was realized by Henan Jinma Energy Company Limited (HKG:6885) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 17%. That's well bellow the market return of 12%. Henan Jinma Energy hasn't been listed for long, so although we're wary of recent listings that perform poorly, it may still prove itself with time. It's up 3.7% in the last seven days. View our latest analysis for Henan Jinma Energy There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Henan Jinma Energy share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 13%. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.The fact that the dividend has fallen is probably weighing on the share price, as it implies some form of business stress.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SEHK:6885 Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Henan Jinma Energy's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Henan Jinma Energy's TSR for the last year was -5.6%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveGiven that the market gained 12% in the last year, Henan Jinma Energy shareholders might be miffed that they lost 5.6% (even including dividends) . However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. It's great to see a nice little 3.0% rebound in the last three months. Let's just hope this isn't the widely-feared 'dead cat bounce' (which would indicate further declines to come).
