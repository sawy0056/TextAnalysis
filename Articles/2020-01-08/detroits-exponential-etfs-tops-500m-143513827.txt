That's vital amid increasing concerns about competition in a business where the three largest issuers combine to manager more than 80% of assets.In addition to the aforementioned ACSI and RVRS, Exponential acts as the sub-advisor for a dozen other ETFs, including a slew of newer products.Some of the well-known names among that group include the SoFi Select 500 ETF (NYSE: SFY) and the SoFi Next 500 ETF (NYSE: SFYX), which are known for having 0% expense ratios.Exponential also acts as the sub-advisor for The Acquirers Fund ETF (NYSE: ZIG), Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (NYSE: BLOK) and the Amplify Advanced Battery Metals and Materials ETF (NYSE: BATT), among others.What's NextWith the pace of new ETF launches still robust, Exponential's sub-advisory business is poised to benefit as more issuers test the waters with unique concepts challenging the pure beta fare often offered by the industry's behemoths.“The AUM milestone comes as Charles Ragauss, Managing Director, is promoted to the newly created position of Chief Operating Officer,” according to Exponential. “In his new role, Mr. Ragauss will continue to oversee and manage the day-to-day operations of the firm, including its proprietary strategies and portfolio management sub-advisory business. Meanwhile, Josh Blechman, Director of Capital Markets, is being promoted to Managing Director and will oversee the firm’s expansion of its capital markets service offerings.”Related Links:Winning Sector ETFs For JanuaryWhy This Oil ETN Could Be Ready To Rally 0See more from Benzinga3 International Vanguard ETFs With Newly Lower FeesFlaring Tensions With Iran Could Spark This Geared Oil ETN© 2020 Benzinga.com.
