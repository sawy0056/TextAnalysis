Rising crude prices are often a headwind to airline equities and that was the case last week as the US Global Jets ETF (JETS) lost 2.75%.JETS seeks to track the performance of the U.S. Global Jets Index, which is composed of the exchange-listed common stock (or depository receipts) of U.S. and international passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers, airports, and terminal services companies across the globe.Although now may seem like an appropriate time to avoid airline stocks, some market observers are endorsing the opposite strategy.“Our suggestion that investors may want to buy at this point is a counterintuitive conclusion. Jet fuel can represent up to 25% of an airline's total expenses,” reports Al Root for Barron's. “But the U.S. airline industry has earned record profits when oil was about $100 a barrel and gone bankrupt when oil was $40 a barrel. Over the long run, it is the supply and demand balance between airplane seats and customers that determine industry profitability, not the absolute price of oil.”Altitude For JETSRemember that airlines are yet to report fourth-quarter earnings, a period that includes what was a brisk travel season for the industry.Airlines for America (A4A), the industry trade organization for the leading U.S. airlines, projected that 47.5 million passengers will fly globally on U.S. airlines over the 18-day winter holiday travel period from Thursday, December 19, through Sunday, January 5.A4A projects an average of 2.6 million passengers will take to the skies each day over the holidays, with daily volumes ranging from 2.2 million to 3 million. That is an increase of 3 percent from the comparable period a year ago, and to accommodate the 72,000 additional daily passengers, airlines will offer 88,000 additional seats per day and 884 more flights per day.Related: Despite Lyft, Uber Struggles, IPO ETF Performed Well in 2019 With airlines having shown a penchant for increased profitability in recent years, due in large part to ancillary fees and the robust U.S. economy, JETS can potentially stand firm the face of increased near-term oil market volatility.“One conflict shouldn’t change the yearlong outlook for the industry. And it could provide an attractive entry point for aggressive investors willing to buy the stocks as prices fall,” according to Barron's.For more thematic investing trends, visit our Thematic Investing Channel.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Are Markets Overdue for a Bigger Pullback?Are Chipmakers’ Massive Gains Becoming Too Frothy?BKLN: Modest Yield, High RiskFedEx Barks Back At Amazon Over Shipping LimitationsBed Bath & Beyond Does Some Holiday CleaningREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergU.S. Stocks Slide Into a Correction as Virus Fears Show No Sign of EasingThe Wall Street Journal'Apple Of Oil' Hikes Dividend, Cuts Capex After Bakken Leader Guides Cash Flow LowerInvestor's Business DailyBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
