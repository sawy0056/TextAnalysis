Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like Inspur International (HKG:596). Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for Inspur International Inspur International's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Inspur International's earnings per share took off like a rocket; fast, and from a low base. So the actual rate of growth doesn't tell us much. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Inspur International has grown its trailing twelve month EPS from HK$0.25 to HK$0.27, in the last year. That amounts to a small improvement of 6.6%.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing.

As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own Inspur International shares worth a considerable sum. Indeed, they hold HK$210m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Those holdings account for over 5.7% of the company; visible skin in the game.Is Inspur International Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Inspur International is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Just as polish makes silverware pop, the high level of insider ownership enhances my enthusiasm for this growth. The combination sparks joy for me, so I'd consider keeping the company on a watchlist. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock.
