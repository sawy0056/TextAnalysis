Senior Helpers is ALCA's only national in-home care partner. The two companies will continue to strive toward a shared mission to ensure all seniors receive personalized and compassionate care.(PRNewsfoto/Senior Helpers)MoreThis includes exploration of care delivery informed by Senior Helpers LIFE Profile, a revolutionary data-driven process for evaluating ongoing care requirements and risks associated with social determinants of health that can lead to hospitalization and lower quality of life. Used in combination with Senior Helpers' best in class caregivers, LIFE Profile has demonstrated that care plans that are personalized and prioritized towards risk reduction can significantly improve client care and reduce overall system costs. According to the 2018 Profile of Older Americans, the 85 and over population is projected to more than double from 6.5 million in 2017 to 14.4 million in 2040, a 123 percent increase. Additionally, more than one in every seven, or nearly 16 percent of the U.S. population is an older American—someone aged 65 and up. As the population grows older, the need for aging life care managers grows. Moreover, today, approximately 21 percent of seniors who are released from a skilled nursing facility are admitted to a hospital emergency room within 30 days."We are honored to partner with ALCA, the nation's premier organization for aging science and life care management," said Mike Hughes, Vice President of Strategic Development, Senior Helpers. "We look forward to working with the ALCA and its highly respected membership to elevate the quality of senior care nationwide. Together we are taking important steps forward in improving quality of life for the nation's seniors despite age-related illnesses and mobility challenges." Senior Helpers, along with its owners across Florida, will sponsor the ALCA Florida Chapter 2020 Annual Conference taking place at the Hyatt Regency in Sarasota from Jan. 9-11. The ALCA Florida Chapter is dedicated to promoting the professional field of care management by training, assisting, regulating, educating, and supporting qualified senior care managers who provide a full range of services to aging individuals, their families, and caregivers.
