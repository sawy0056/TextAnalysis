(NASDAQ:BELF.B) share price has gained some 49% in the last three months. But that cannot eclipse the less-than-impressive returns over the last three years. After all, the share price is down 40% in the last three years, significantly under-performing the market. Check out our latest analysis for Bel Fuse While Bel Fuse made a small profit, in the last year, we think that the market is probably more focussed on the top line growth at the moment. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. For shareholders to have confidence a company will grow profits significantly, it must grow revenue.Over three years, Bel Fuse grew revenue at 3.1% per year. Given it's losing money in pursuit of growth, we are not really impressed with that. Indeed, the stock dropped 15% over the last three years. Shareholders will probably be hoping growth picks up soon. But the real upside for shareholders will be if the company can start generating profits.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:BELF.B Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreWe know that Bel Fuse has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Bel Fuse stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Bel Fuse, it has a TSR of -37% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveBel Fuse provided a TSR of 9.4% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. But at least that's still a gain! Over five years the TSR has been a reduction of 3.3% per year, over five years. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around.
