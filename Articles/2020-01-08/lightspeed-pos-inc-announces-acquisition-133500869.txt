(CNW Group/Lightspeed POS Inc.)MoreLightspeed's acquisition of Germany's premier cloud-based hospitality POS solutions provider brings two high-performing, complimentary teams together to better assist European merchants as they transition to the cloud.With the addition of Gastrofix's over 8,000 customer locations, including the Michelin-starred Seven Seas ( Hamburg ), Leaders Club winner Bar Shuka ( Frankfurt ) and the luxury Steigenberger Hotels and Resorts, Lightspeed solidifies its presence in Europe , namely in countries such as Germany , Austria and Norway , opening up access to an array of cloud-based services designed to propel European businesses forward.
