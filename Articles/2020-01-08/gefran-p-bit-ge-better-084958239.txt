(BIT:GE) Better Than Average At Deploying Capital?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 7, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we'll look at Gefran S.p.A. (BIT:GE) and reflect on its potential as an investment. Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Gefran:0.11 = €12m ÷ (€159m - €52m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Gefran has an ROCE of 11%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Do Gefran's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Current liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Gefran has total liabilities of €52m and total assets of €159m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 33% of its total assets. Gefran has a middling amount of current liabilities, increasing its ROCE somewhat.What We Can Learn From Gefran's ROCEWhile its ROCE looks good, it's worth remembering that the current liabilities are making the business look better.
