The companies will integrate their digital platforms to provide their growers and dealer networks with a first-of-its-kind, fully connected crop management solution.MoreAs part of the strategic initiative, Farmers Edge will provide Lindsay access to both high-resolution satellite imagery and the most comprehensive field-centric dataset available in the industry. Syncing Lindsay's market-leading irrigation management platform—FieldNET Advisor®—with the Farmers Edge fully-integrated, AI-driven farm management platform—FarmCommand®— creates an exclusive opportunity for growers to access digital tools that deliver real-time information to control pivots and monitor crop health, along with advanced predictive models to help identify issues, including: seeding or application errors, tile drainage, weather damage, pests, disease, and more. The combination of the two digital platforms enables growers to make more informed water management decisions to optimize applications and yield potential.Adding another layer of connectivity to its suite of solutions, Farmers Edge will provide Lindsay's FieldNET Pivot Watch™—a remote irrigation monitoring solution that includes proprietary IoT sensors that connect to any center pivot—and FieldNET Advisor to help growers better understand when, where, and how much to irrigate."This integration of platforms enables growers to use tools like high-resolution satellite imagery to see a visual indication of variation in crop health across a field from the convenience of their laptop or smartphone. The connected farm strategy also enables growers to collect all aspects of field data and feed that information into FieldNET Advisor and FarmCommand. Once that data is collected, the platforms can provide AI-powered insights to ensure the most accurate decisions are being made on the farm," said Albert Maurin, product manager for irrigation software at Lindsay Corporation. "We are excited to bring growers this evolution of our partnership with Farmers Edge, and we will continue to leverage our industry partners to deliver innovative irrigation solutions to our customers.""Our goal at Lindsay is to help growers increase water and energy efficiency and profit while exercising more sustainable farming practices, and we firmly believe digitization in agriculture is key to that," said Randy Wood, president of global agricultural irrigation at Lindsay Corporation. "Farmers Edge is very much aligned with that vision, and we're confident that by connecting our platforms through this strategic partnership, we'll reach our goal of two million digitized and connected irrigated acres by the end of 2021."Story continues"At Farmers Edge, we're focused on creating a digital agricultural ecosystem that's centered around a fully connected farm. Farmers Edge has thousands of connected machines, weather stations, and in-field sensors across the globe, but we have yet to bring a crucial asset—center pivots," said Wade Barnes, CEO and co-founder of Farmers Edge. "Having access to FieldNET Pivot Watch is a key component for achieving this goal.  The ability to add pivot irrigation data into our unique field-centric datasets, and then move that information into FieldNET Advisor is extremely exciting. The power of the insights and analytics from the partnership will change how farms use irrigation, and we're eager to bring this type of industry changing technology to two million irrigated acres by 2021."Availability:This enhanced platform will be available to new and existing Farmers Edge and Lindsay growers through the Zimmatic® dealer network and the Farmers Edge sales network.For more information about FieldNET technology, talk to a local Zimmatic dealer or visit www.myfieldnet.com. For more information about Farmers Edge precision digital solutions, visit www.FarmersEdgeUSA.com. About Lindsay CorporationLindsay Corporation (NYSE: LNN) is a leading global manufacturer and distributor of irrigation and infrastructure equipment and technology.
