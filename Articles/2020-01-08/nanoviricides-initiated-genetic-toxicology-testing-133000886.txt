(NYSE Amer.:NNVC) (the "Company") a company with novel platform technology to treat difficult and life-threatening viral diseases, announces that it has contracted and initiated genetic toxicology testing required to support the IND application for NV-HHV-101 moving towards human clinical trials.The Company previously contracted an external laboratory to conduct the studies to assess the genetic toxicologic safety potential of our lead drug candidate, namely NV-HHV-101. These studies include the standard Ames test that utilizes bacterial cells to determine if the drug candidate causes mutations, and also the standardized "micronucleus test" to determine if the drug candidate causes damage to the chromosomes in human cells. The FDA and other international regulatory authorities require these genetic toxicological studies to support the Investigational New Drug (IND) Applications for entering human clinical trials. We are advised that these studies have been completed and we anticipate the results shortly.After receiving all of the reports from the various required IND-enabling studies, the Company anticipates filing an IND with the US FDA to advance NV-HHV-101 into human clinical trials for topical dermal treatment of the shingles rash as the initial indication. This indication alone has an estimated market size in billion dollars range.The Company also continues to evaluate this broad-spectrum drug candidate as well as certain variations based on the same candidate, for the treatment of other herpesviruses, namely HSV-1 cold sores and HSV-2 genital herpes. The market size for our immediate target drugs in the HerpeCide™ program is variously estimated into several billions to tens of billions of dollars. The Company believes that its dermal topical cream for the treatment of shingles rash will be its first drug heading into clinical trials. The Company believes that additional topical treatment candidates in the HerpeCide™ program, namely, HSV-1 "cold sores" treatment, and HSV-2 "genital ulcers" treatment are expected to follow the shingles candidate into IND-enabling development and then into human clinical trials.About NanoViricidesNanoViricides, Inc.
