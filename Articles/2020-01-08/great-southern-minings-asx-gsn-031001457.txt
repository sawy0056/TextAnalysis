But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the Great Southern Mining Limited (ASX:GSN) share price is 250% higher than it was three years ago. That sort of return is as solid as granite. On top of that, the share price is up 25% in about a quarter. View our latest analysis for Great Southern Mining We don't think Great Southern Mining's revenue of AU$3,156 is enough to establish significant demand. As a result, we think it's unlikely shareholders are paying much attention to current revenue, but rather speculating on growth in the years to come. For example, investors may be hoping that Great Southern Mining finds some valuable resources, before it runs out of money.As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. There is usually a significant chance that they will need more money for business development, putting them at the mercy of capital markets. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some companies like this go on to deliver on their plan, making good money for shareholders, many end in painful losses and eventual de-listing. Some Great Southern Mining investors have already had a taste of the sweet taste stocks like this can leave in the mouth, as they gain popularity and attract speculative capital.Our data indicates that Great Southern Mining had AU$394k more in total liabilities than it had cash, when it last reported in June 2019. That makes it extremely high risk, in our view. So the fact that the stock is up 65% per year, over 3 years shows that high risks can lead to high rewards, sometimes. It's clear more than a few people believe in the potential. You can see in the image below, how Great Southern Mining's cash levels have changed over time (click to see the values).

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Great Southern Mining hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of 250% exceeds its share price return of 250%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Great Southern Mining has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 133% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 22% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
