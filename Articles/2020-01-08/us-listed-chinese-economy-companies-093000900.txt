I'd say more and more senior management at these US-listed Chinese companies are listening to our advice on a secondary listing now, compared to a year ago," said Lee.Sam Lee, managing director and head of equity research at China Renaissance.

Lee refused to comment on the reports.Thanks to Alibaba's mega US$12.9 billion IPO last year, Hong Kong regained its crown as the world's biggest IPO market, raising a total of HK$315.5 billion, the largest amount since 2010. Shanghai Stock Exchange ranked fourth, raising HK205.3 billion, bolstered by the new Star Market.Story continuesChina Renaissance has helped various new-economy companies complete their share offerings and listings in the US. These include fintech companies such as Yirendai and Lexin, e-commerce operators such as JD.com, and smart-wearables maker Huami.Hong Kong to 'stay competitive' as a top IPO destination in 2020, KPMG saysThe swelling interest from ADR issuers to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong or China could definitely be a boon to the investment bank's equity capital market business. China Renaissance said it was the third-biggest underwriter of overseas IPOs of China's new-economy companies between 2013 and 2019, after Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.Not all new-economy companies have enjoyed a stellar trading performance. In fact, many have completely flopped. For example, Chinese electric car maker NIO has been languishing below its IPO price of US$6.26 on the New York Stock Exchange since its debut in September 2018. It once dropped to just above US$1.Alex Liu, a China Renaissance analyst focusing on China's internet and education sector, said he expects Chinese tech companies' valuations will continue to face pressure over the next few years, as the explosive growth in the sector runs out of steam."Still, private equity investors in these companies will need to [cash out from] their investments, and hence these companies would not rescind their IPOs," he said.Their comments came as the investment bank launches its inaugural research report on the outlook for China's macro economy and equities market.It forecasts the MSCI China index could climb as much as 12 per cent this year, based on growth of 11.6 per cent in earnings per share and a 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple of 13.65 times.It remains overweight on e-commerce, online games, healthcare, logistics, and tech hardware, all of it defines as "new economy" sectors.Sign up now for our 50% early bird offer from SCMP Research: China AI Report.
