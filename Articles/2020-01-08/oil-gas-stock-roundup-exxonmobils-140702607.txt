Meanwhile, Core Labs CLB slashed its dividend by 55% and lowered fourth-quarter guidance.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed 2.2% to close at $63.05 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 4.5% for the week to finish at 2.13 per million Btu (MMBtu).The U.S. crude benchmark rallied to multi-month highs, pushed up by concerns that escalating U.S. - Iran tensions in the Middle East could lead to supply disruptions. A large decline in domestic inventories and news of Chinese economic stimulus that could propel demand, lent additional support to the oil market.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved southward following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies and expectations of warmer weather in January that could jeopardize power sector demand for the heating fuel.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.  ExxonMobil expects a gain of $3.4-$3.6 billion from the divestment of Norwegian assets. This will likely give a boost to its fourth-quarter 2019 results. The company’s recent regulatory filing showed that the gains from this divestment can offset lower margins from chemicals and refining businesses.The Norway divestment deal of September included ownership interests in more than 20 producing fields, with total production of around 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019.The recent regulatory filing reflected the largest publicly-traded energy company’s decline in profits from the chemicals business. It is further expected to take a hit from a global glut in polyethylene. Similarly, the downstream business — which generated $1.2 billion in profits in third-quarter 2019 — is expected to take a $800-$600 million hit in the fourth quarter.

The project was expected to come online by November 2020. This is certainly good news for investors! The accomplishment came 11 months prior to the expected date to fulfil the rise in demand for natural gas from customers residing in New Jersey’s tri-state area during the winter-heating period of 2019 to 2020.Gateway project is an extension of the company’s Transco pipeline. Notably, the pipeline supplies almost half of the natural gas consumed in New York and New Jersey. With the existing Transco pipeline capacity being fully utilized, additional gas volumes will be delivered to the northeastern markets. As a matter of fact, this expansion increased the pipeline’s system-design capacity to 17.3 million dekatherms per day This system contains roughly 10,000 miles long pipeline connecting South Texas with New York City.Story continuesWith this project, the natural gas service provider will support almost 280,000 households with their daily home heating, warm water and cooking needs. This, in turn, will help customers switch from heating oil to natural gas, potentially saving nearly $1,460 per annually per household in contrast to heating oil. Throughout the construction process, the project curbed the community and environmental effects by increasing the functioning of the existing pipeline infrastructure with virtually all project activities within Transco’s bounds in New Jersey.
