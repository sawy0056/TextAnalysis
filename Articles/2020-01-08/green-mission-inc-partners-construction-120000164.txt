Wein, of counsel with Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, Pittsburgh's third largest law firm, who is also immediate past president of Construction Junction as well as former president and current Emeritus board member of the PRC, facilitated the idea with firm management and the nonprofit organizations to ensure good use of the firm's old office furniture. Buchanan donated approximately 65 percent of the furniture it was not moving to the new building.Mayur Dankhara, COO of TGMI and Jennie Lumpkin, Director of New Business and their team, were able to find a home for most furnishings quickly at several Pittsburgh school districts.

Mike Gable, executive director of Construction Junction was able to accept a portion of the property and lastly TGMI was able to place a large amount of reusable metal cabinets with the Baldwin-Whitehall School District in the suburbs of Pittsburgh."The Baldwin-Whitehall School District is thankful to both Buchanan Ingersoll and The Green Mission Inc for the donation of office furniture.  This furniture will be utilized by 11 different school districts in Southwestern Pennsylvania," said Mark Cherpak, Business Manager of Baldwin-Whitehall School District."We were thrilled that Baldwin-Whitehall School District, along with eleven others, was able to accept over 2,000 pieces of furniture and over 200 metal filing cabinets for use within their facilities. The ability to divert waste and decrease landfill usage reduces environmental waste. It's a win-win for all involved and allows the district to use scarce funding for more important purposes," said Jessica Marschall, CPA and president and CEO of TGMI."As with all waste diversion projects, our goal is to provide the means by which individuals and businesses move toward a paradigm of reuse as the primary mode of asset acquisition before purchasing new," Marschall added. About The Green Mission Inc.The Green Mission Inc. contracts with individuals and corporations to facilitate the entire process of waste diversion, specializing in corporate office clean-outs and construction and demolition waste.  Corporations may choose to deconstruct office space and/or donate office supplies, building materials, equipment and furniture.  Individuals may choose to deconstruct living spaces and donate reusable building materials to local 501(c)(3) charitable non-profit organizations or government entities for a tax deduction.
