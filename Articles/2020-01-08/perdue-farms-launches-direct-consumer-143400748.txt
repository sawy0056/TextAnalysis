"We're excited that this is the first time we've been able to offer so many of our brands in one place, nationally. Now, consumers all over the country will be able to enjoy expanded offerings from our portfolio regardless of where they live, including heritage, organic, pasture raised, pork, beef, chicken or lamb – all raised with no antibiotics ever by farm families with the highest standards of animal care."All packaging from online orders is 100% recyclable. The foam insulation is made from water-soluble cornstarch, which can be composted or even disintegrated under running water and safely rinsed down a kitchen sink.Each order includes a reusable shopping tote and a packet of bee- and butterfly-friendly seeds for consumers to plant in their yards or elsewhere around their communities to help the local pollinator population flourish.Additionally, with each sale through this new website, Perdue Farms will make a donation to the Arbor Day Foundation to help offset the shipment's carbon footprint, which will equate to removing more than 70 pounds of CO2 from the atmosphere per order.Drawing inspiration from Perdue Farms' existing logo, the new e-commerce platform features dedicated branding and a modernized version of Perdue's iconic farmhouse graphic to represent the role that this channel plays in the company's total sales initiatives."Through our e-commerce logo's new tagline, we're giving a nod to our company's farming history, the family ownership and leadership that still exists today, and the farm families – many of whom are multiple generations – who partner with us to produce trusted, wholesome, high-quality products," said Chris Perdue, director of e-commerce at Perdue Farms."Our company is turning 100 years old this year. To make it this long, we believe we're doing something right. This includes keeping a modern, forward-looking mindset and constantly innovating. We are always listening to our consumers and striving to provide them with solutions that fit easily into their lifestyle. That includes not only offering the differentiated products people love, but also making the products available to buy through the channels where they prefer to shop," said Randy Day, chief executive officer of Perdue Farms.Consumers can sign up at PerdueFarms.com to receive additional information, regular newsletters, and current promotional offers, including 10% off their first order.In its centennial year, Perdue Farms remains committed to being a leader in animal care, environmental stewardship, innovation, and a strong partner to the members of its farm family network.
