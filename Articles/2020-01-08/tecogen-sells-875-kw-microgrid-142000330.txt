(TGEN), a clean energy company providing ultra-efficient, clean, natural gas-powered on-site power, heating, and cooling equipment, is pleased to announce the sale 7 InVerde e+ microgrid enabled cogeneration units to a school district in upstate New York. The system will replace existing, non-microgrid Tecogen units that have been in operation for over 21 years. The new system will allow the school to rely on the 875 kW output of the cogeneration units to supply backup power in the event of a grid outage, an important feature in the district's decision to install the InVerde e+ system."The existing cogeneration plant provided heat and power to this school district since 1998," said Jeff Glick, Vice President of East Coast Sales for Tecogen. "In addition to the significant savings the district has historically received, the plant provided well over 66,000 tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction when compared to energy from the existing utility. The system will also eliminate the need for standby diesel generators currently used for backup power which have far greater emissions and rely on limited onsite fuel storage."The Tecogen InVerde e+ system provides dramatic reductions in the cost to heat and power buildings such as school systems while reducing the GHG footprint of the facility. The added resiliency to grid outages that the InVerde microgrid technology provides was also a significant factor in the selection of Tecogen for the project. Schools are often designated as emergency shelters, and the added backup power of the InVerde system to the district eliminates the need for dedicated standby generators to provide power in the event of a grid outage."Many municipal buildings such as schools are turning to our InVerde e+ system to provide both resiliency to grid outages and compliance with energy and emissions reduction goals," noted Benjamin Locke, Tecogen Chief Executive Officer. "We are very pleased that existing customers such as this school district recognize the sustained value and longstanding reliability of Tecogen equipment and services and chose to upgrade their facility with the InVerde microgrid technology. The new cogeneration system will continue to provide significant operational cost saving while eliminating the need for diesel generators in the event of a power outage."The project will include a five-year maintenance contract and is expected to be operational in fall 2020.About TecogenTecogen Inc. designs, manufactures, sells, installs, and maintains high efficiency, ultra-clean, cogeneration products including natural gas engine-driven combined heat and power, air conditioning systems, and high-efficiency water heaters for residential, commercial, recreational and industrial use.
