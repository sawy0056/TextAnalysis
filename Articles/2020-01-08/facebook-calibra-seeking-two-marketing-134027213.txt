Both positions require ideal candidates to have at least 15 years of marketing experience and 10 years of leadership experience.“Our ultimate goal is to help billions of people with access to things they don't have now - that could be things like equitable financial services, it could be new ways to save, it could be new ways to share information,” say the job postings.The head of brand role requires candidates to “champion and build the company and product brand,” while the head of media and digital marketing role is expected to help “build full funnel acquisition and engagement/cross-sell strategies that drive incremental and accretive customer growth and engagement.”
Overall, Calibra currently has 26 open positions, including product managers and engineers, according to Facebook’s careers page.Calibra wallet and Libra stablecoin are scheduled to launch later this year, but have faced criticism from regulators around the world due to Facebook’s data privacy issues. Most recently, Switzerland’s President Ueli Maurer said that Libra has “failed” in its current form "because the basket of currencies that is deposited in this currency is not accepted by the national [central] banks."
The basket of currencies includes 50% U.S. dollar, 18% euro, 14% Japanese yen, 11% British pound, and 7% Singapore dollar.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFacebook Cancels Annual Conference Due to Coronavirus Concerns: 'This Was a Tough Call to Make'PeopleGrandfather, Navy vet among 5 victims of Wisconsin shootingAssociated PressThe man behind a satirical Facebook account promoting fake news has a message: 'Do not believe everything that you read online'Yahoo LifestyleLocal reporter's blunder captured on livestream: 'Did I have a weird face?'In The KnowFacebook sues analytics firm that stole user data through third-party appsEngadgetBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
