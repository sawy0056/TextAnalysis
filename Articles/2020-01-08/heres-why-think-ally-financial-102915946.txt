But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for Ally Financial Ally Financial's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. It's no surprise, then, that I like to invest in companies with EPS growth. Who among us would not applaud Ally Financial's stratospheric annual EPS growth of 38%, compound, over the last three years? Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but like a lotus blooming from a murky pond, it sparks joy for the wary stock pickers.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of Ally Financial's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note Ally Financial's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 3.7% to US$6.0b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Ally Financial Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$11b company like Ally Financial. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. To be specific, they have US$47m worth of shares. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 0.4% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Ally Financial, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$11m.Ally Financial offered total compensation worth US$9.6m to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given its below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Story continuesDoes Ally Financial Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Ally Financial's earnings per share growth have been levitating higher, like a mountain goat scaling the Alps. The cherry on top is that insiders own a bucket-load of shares, and the CEO pay seems really quite reasonable. The sharp increase in earnings could signal good business momentum. Ally Financial certainly ticks a few of my boxes, so I think it's probably well worth further consideration. Of course, just because Ally Financial is growing does not mean it is undervalued.
