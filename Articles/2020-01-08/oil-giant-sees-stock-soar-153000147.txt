Christmann saying “We are very pleased with results from Maka Central-1.”“Preliminary formation evaluation data indicates the potential for prolific oil wells. Additionally, the size of the stratigraphic feature, as defined by 3-D seismic imaging, suggests a substantial resource,” Christmann said.“In partnership with Total, we look forward to advancing both exploration and development of discoveries on the block,” Apache’s top executive added.Major discoveries offshore Suriname could turn the South American country into an oil producer, the way significant oil discoveries made its neighbor Guyana the world’s newest oil producer.Related: Why Pirates Are Giving Up On OilAt the end of last year, Guyana officially joined the ranks of oil producing nations, after ExxonMobil and its partners began oil production offshore the South American country.ExxonMobil and its partner Hess Corporation launched oil production from the Liza field offshore Guyana ahead of schedule and less than five years after the first discovery of oil, the U.S. supermajor said in a statement.The first cargo of oil from Guyana is set to be sold within several weeks, while production from Liza Phase 1 is expected to reach full capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) in the coming months, Exxon said.   Apache Corp. saw its share price rise more than 20% on the news.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Will Oil Prices Crash Or Rally When Iran Reacts?How To Short The World’s Largest Oil CompanyThe Hottest Permian Takeover Targets For 2020Read this article on OilPrice.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCultural preservation among options in oil and gas planAssociated PressOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersEOG Resources (EOG) Q4 Earnings Top EstimatesZacks'Apple Of Oil' Hikes Dividend, Cuts Capex After Bakken Leader Guides Cash Flow LowerInvestor's Business DailyChinese scientist sentenced to prison in US for technology theftAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
