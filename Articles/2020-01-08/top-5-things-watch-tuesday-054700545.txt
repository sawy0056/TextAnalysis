Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, Jan. 7.Geopolitical tensions easeCalm returned to markets Tuesday, but sentiment remained fragile as investors became less anxious about the chances of an all-out conflict between the United States and Iran in the absence of any fresh developments in the standoff between the two countries.Tehran and Washington have been trading threats since Friday, when a top Iranian military commander was killed in a U.S. airstrike. The attack stoked concerns about all-out war if Tehran retaliates.“While the risk of conflict has increased, the reality is this is likely to be limited to proxy skirmishes," said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets. "The risk of a "hot" conflict seems low as Iran is unlikely to respond in such a way that risks a significant escalation from the United States."Global stocks steadyU.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open, with Dow futures rising 25 points, or 0.1% by 6:45 AM ET (1:45 GMT), while the S&P 500 futures contract was up a similar amount and the Nasdaq 100 futures was up 0.3%.The gains came after U.S. equities reversed early losses on Monday as strong gains in the tech sector offset geopolitical tensions.In Europe shares recovered snapping a two-day losing streak, boosted by gains in the tech sector.
