(MBII) (MBI), an international leader in sustainable bioprotection and plant health solutions, today announced that two of its biofungicide products—Stargus® and Regalia®—have been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for indoor and outdoor use on hemp plants.Stargus and Regalia improve hemp plant quality and yield, as well as treat and protect hemp plants from a range of diseases, including powdery mildew, Botrytis bud rot, Sclerotinia white mold, Fusarium rots and wilts and other fungal and bacterial diseases. This is the first time that the EPA has approved crop protection products on hemp since the crop became legal to grow under the 2018 Farm Bill.“With more than $1.1 billion in revenues in 2018, the hemp market is projected to more than double by 2022,” said Dr. Pamela Marrone, CEO and Founder of Marrone Bio Innovations. “This is an exciting opportunity for Marrone Bio to extend our business into a rapidly growing market, which will only continue to grow as the acres continue to expand. With Stargus and Regalia now approved at the federal level for hemp, we are well positioned to grow alongside this burgeoning market.”Chemical pesticides dominate today’s $60 billion global pesticides market, but the fastest-growing category of crop inputs is biologicals. When integrated into crop production and pest management programs, biologicals – including Stargus and Regalia – can offer higher-quality crops and better yields. Both products are applicable for organic farming as well.The bacteria in Stargus work by colonizing plant root hairs, leaves and other plant surfaces, thereby preventing establishment of fungal and bacterial pathogens. The Stargus bacteria also produce natural compounds that inhibit detrimental bacterial, fungal growth and spore germination. Further, the Stargus bacteria trigger immune responses in the plant to ward off diseases and increase both growth and yield, creating a healthier and stronger plant.MBI’s Regalia Biofungicide, based on a plant extract, delivers better yield and improved harvest quality. Regalia helps to increase crop performance by stimulating a plant’s innate ability to fight diseases. This fungicide offers preventative activity and early control of yield-robbing diseases, resulting in increased marketable yield and top profit on every acre.MBI is now pursuing state approvals under the Regalia and Stargus labels, with hemp uses added, to ensure product availability for the 2020 growing season.  Please check the following website https://marronebio.com for regular updates on state approvals and product information.About Marrone Bio Innovations     Marrone Bio Innovations Inc.
