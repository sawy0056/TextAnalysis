The key end-markets are semiconductor, metrology, advanced communication and medical devices.Here are the three major themes in the industry:The industry is benefiting from increasing demand for emerging applications like additive manufacturing, facial recognition, gesture recognition, LIDAR applications and IoT. Advanced lasers, especially those with 3D sensing (3DS) capabilities, are enhancing interactions using technology. Notably, 3DS, the technology that allows users to create 3D printable objects, control games with body gestures and measure objects, is much in demand. As industries are increasingly adopting automation techniques, combining lasers with IoT improves operating efficiency. Notably, IoT-supported manufacturing equipment is far easier to update with firmware. The combination not only reduces costs but also increases flexibility and reliability manifold by enabling material handling capabilities through remote sources. Additionally, strong demand from semiconductor and allied markets, which are seeing a rapid shift toward production of micro and nano devices, is a positive for industry participants. The Phase-One deal between the United States and China is a positive for the Laser Systems and Components industry. However, a slowing Chinese economy is a concern as industry players like IPG Photonics (IPGP) have significant exposure to the country’s industrial laser market. Additionally, soft infrastructure spending in China significantly reduced demand for lasers, affecting top-line growth of industry participants. Moreover, the U.S. ban on Huawei is a bother. Inventory build-up at the Chinese tech-giant doesn’t bode well for its component suppliers, some of whom are customers of the Laser Systems and Components industry players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Laser Systems and Components industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.
