To meet growing customer demand for a seamless omnichannel experience, Waitrose & Partners connected their eCommerce and self-scanning solutions to the Flooid Core store basket microservices, a platform that connects the online journey with mobile solutions and fixed tills in 340 physical stores with the help of Flooid, ensuring customers have a consistent basket and pricing experience across online, mobile and in store. With JLP looking at synergies across the two retail brands, Flooid and JLP are collaborating to help identify opportunities and maximise value from the Waitrose & Partners Checkout & Payment solutions, including Flooid Core basket capabilities."We've built one service that includes the basket pricing system, which is then used by our self-scan solution to look up prices, which is also used by our customers on our eCommerce platform. You build a service once and make it as efficient as possible for use in many places with consistent pricing data. We wouldn't have been able to do that without Flooid's capabilities," said Matt Clifton, Partner & Head of Retail Change & Development, Waitrose & Partners.Flooid CEO Tony Houldsworth said: "Many retailers are concerned about new entrants and the rise of disruptive retail. They find themselves stuck with siloed systems, so they're unable to provide consistent customer experiences across channels. Innovation is difficult, risky and costly."With Flooid none of that is an issue. They can thrive, and even become disruptors themselves."Flooid Chief Digital Officer Tanya Bowen said: "Flooid's basket microservices deliver deep, resilient basket functionality across any sales channel, from POS to mobile, and across all retail verticals."The basket can be either cloud-based for elastic scalability or distributed to run on fixed devices such as fixed POS registers – crucial for high volume and high scale store environments."This gives retailers what they need most; freedom to innovate, freedom to lower cost of ownership and freedom to deliver high-value, personalized, fluid experiences to their customers – at scale."++ Flooid will be unveiling its new brand at NRF 2020 in New York from January 11th to 14th.
