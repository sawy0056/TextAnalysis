Consumers happy with their Try-Ons can confidently order higher priced glasses from various online retailers using the same EGNs. Consumers who are not completely satisfied can return the glasses for a full refund.“Our mission is to make vision screening and correction easy and accessible to everyone,” said John Serri, PhD., co-founder and president of EyeQue. “Our at-home refraction tests empower consumers to use the results to order new glasses without having to leave home. This new offering of Try-On Glasses gives our customers a fast, affordable way to know exactly how well new glasses purchased using their EyeGlass Numbers will perform for them.”The EyeQue Try-On Glasses will be available in limited quantity in February and will roll out on EyeQue.com in April 2020. Customers who take refractive error tests and obtain EyeGlass Numbers through their EyeQue VisionCheck® or EyeQue Personal Vision Tracker® will have an option for ordering Try-On Glasses (estimated MSRP $15) with expected delivery of less than a week.As a CES exclusive, EyeQue is offering 10 percent off all smartphone vision solutions purchased at eyeque.com using code CES2020. Customers who purchase the refractive error solutions (VisionCheck, Personal Vision Tracker, or the Vision Monitoring Kit) using this code will automatically be registered for the EyeQue Try-On Glasses beta program (February), including a pair of Try-On Glasses at no cost.
