For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?So, the natural question for Candente Copper (TSE:DNT) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. Check out our latest analysis for Candente Copper When Might Candente Copper Run Out Of Money?A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. In September 2019, Candente Copper had US$12k in cash, and was debt-free. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through US$721k. So it seems to us it had a cash runway of less than two months from September 2019. It's extremely surprising to us that the company has allowed its cash runway to get that short! The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.TSX:DNT Historical Debt, January 7th 2020MoreHow Is Candente Copper's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Because Candente Copper isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. As it happens, the company's cash burn reduced by 41% over the last year, which suggests that management are mindful of the possibility of running out of cash. Admittedly, we're a bit cautious of Candente Copper due to its lack of significant operating revenues. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.How Easily Can Candente Copper Raise Cash?While Candente Copper is showing a solid reduction in its cash burn, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).Since it has a market capitalisation of US$4.5m, Candente Copper's US$721k in cash burn equates to about 16% of its market value. As a result, we'd venture that the company could raise more cash for growth without much trouble, albeit at the cost of some dilution.Is Candente Copper's Cash Burn A Worry?On this analysis of Candente Copper's cash burn, we think its cash burn reduction was reassuring, while its cash runway has us a bit worried. After looking at that range of measures, we think shareholders should be extremely attentive to how the company is using its cash, as the cash burn makes us uncomfortable.
