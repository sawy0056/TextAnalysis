While external factors can contribute towards accidents, the reality is that the most dangerous aspect of the driving experience is the driver.A driving monitoring system (DMS) uses a camera to monitor driver alertness that not only recognises the driver, but also checks his or her level of vigilance. Its purpose is to alert the driver when signs of drowsiness or distraction are detected. A DMS can trigger alerts to the driver and initiate an intervention to manage the control of the vehicle. In semi-autonomous vehicles, such as Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) level 3 (conditional automation), the driver must be ready to take back control of the vehicle. A DMS, therefore, ensures that the driver is ready to take control of the vehicle when the situation dictates. When highly automated vehicles become available (level 5), driver monitoring will become even more significant. Hence the current focus of development is on camera-based facial recognition technology.This report sets out analysis of the DMS market, providing some detailed information on the main drivers, trends, opportunities and challenges facing the sector.The scope of this report includes:The current status of driver monitoring systems:
