OSR, the new student resource site, based their ranking strictly on data, prioritizing the school's ability to deliver an online education comparable to an on-campus degree.Out of the nearly $7 trillion the US government spent in 2019, the biggest chunk of it, 26.1%, was spent by the Department of Health and Human Services. That's $1.8 trillion, more than the Department of Defense. The country allocates a lot of resources toward helping the population. Unavoidably, there will always be people in need. But with these resources and qualified Human Services professionals, more people will get the help they need.Based on the numbers, these are the programs that will make you into that qualified person.OSR uses six data points to determine the best programs in a given field. Three data points focus on the quality of the school, and three focus on the quality of the individual program under consideration. OSR included these programs in the ranking because their students graduate with minimal debt and have a great support system while in school. These schools are dedicated to quality online education.For a detailed description of the methodology, visit www.onlineschoolsreport.com/methodology.Online education is getting bigger and better—and giving traditional college campuses a run for their money.
