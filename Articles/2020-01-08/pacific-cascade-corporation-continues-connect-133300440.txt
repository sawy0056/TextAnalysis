"One of our product lines is the GreenDrop Recycling & Composting Station.  GreenDrop has helped reduce landfill contributions by visually guiding users how to properly dispose of recyclable and compostable items. If we're marketing a product that promotes sustainability, we better walk the talk," said Jackson."GreenDrops are deployed across the United States at various venues. They help influence sustainability behaviors where people live, work, learn, and play, we should be doing the same in our office and warehouse," added Collard.PCC's employees have their individual areas where they volunteer.  Heather is devoted to Santa's Posse for Wrap Night, where donated toys for underserved children are caringly (if not frantically) wrapped for Christmas.Each year PCC chooses to host a family in need, or a charity they support.  This holiday season, PCC donated to UNICEF."In the coming year, we'll continue to pay it forward and encourage others to do so, even in the smallest way.  Happy New Year," commented Curtis.CONTACT PERSON:Heather JacksonCFO and ControllerPacific Cascade Corporation14208 N.W. 3rd Court • Suite 200Vancouver, WA 986851-800-292-7275 ext. 202231608@email4pr.com parkingzone.comABOUT PACIFIC CASCADE CORPORATIONSince 1987, Pacific Cascade Corporation has been providing the Parking, Hospitality, Traffic Enforcement, and Environmental Sustainability Industries with products to manage and support their effective operational needs.  parkingzone.comCisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pacific-cascade-corporation-continues-to-connect-with-community-300981868.htmlSOURCE Pacific Cascade CorporationReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHow Two Ten’s New CEO Plans to Boost Fundraising & Attract More Industry InsidersFootwear NewsVF Corp.
