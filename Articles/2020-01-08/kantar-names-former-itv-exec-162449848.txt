He told the Financial Times this was a personal decision after he was stabbed in an attempted carjacking in London in January 2019.Salama said Griffiths, who is 53, would bring a wealth of experience to Kantar, which provides data and analytics on consumers in more than 100 countries."His track record in dealing with public markets and delivering strong returns for shareholders, both as CFO and COO, will be important to Kantar as we embark on the next stage of our growth journey," he said.(Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft, Editing by Kate Holton)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFlesh and Blood viewers have one major question after series finale cliffhangerDigital SpyJeremy Kyle teases TV comeback after signing with new management: 'Watch this space'Yahoo Celebrity UKJeremy Kyle will be "back soon to have his say", says his new managementDigital SpyJeremy Kyle to return and ‘have his say’ after ITV show was axed: ‘He’s battled unimaginable consequences’The IndependentCaprice Bourret hits out at ITV over controversial Dancing on Ice exitThe IndependentBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
