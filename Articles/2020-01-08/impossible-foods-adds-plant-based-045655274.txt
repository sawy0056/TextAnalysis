We’ve been serious about that from day one," Impossible Foods CEO and founder Pat Brown said at the trade show. "You cannot have the mission we have without creating delicious, nutritious plant-based pork."Globally, pork is the most popular meat, and Brown said the company's plant-based pork has "40% less calories, 60% less total fat, 40% less saturated fat, zero cholesterol, higher iron" and is missing something found in the world's pork – fecal pathogens.Impossible Croissan’wich: Burger King to test plant-based breakfast sandwich starting in late January'Healthy is the new skinny': Oprah and WW kick off 'Oprah’s 2020 Vision' tour with Lady GagaBrown said the company is interested in introducing its technology in China, where there's not enough land to produce the meat the country's consumers buy, which is why China is dependent on imports."We would love to work with China to enable China to have a meat supply that comes entirely from Chinese farmers and is produced in food production facilities in China by Chinese workers made entirely from plants," Brown said.Chef Traci Des Jardins beta-tested the pork for months and found it a "pleasure to work with.""It really responds in the cooking applications like ground pork," she said. "Working with it is practically identical to working with regular ground pork made from pigs – but fortunately it is made entirely from plants."Also on Monday, Burger King announced it will test the Impossible Croissan’wich, which includes Impossible Foods' plant-based sausage, in five select markets later this month. The fast-food chain worked with Impossible for its Impossible Whopper.“We saw that having a plant-based option is something that really attracts our current guests,” said Fernando Mercado, Burger King’s chief marketing officer. "But not only that, it really brings in people, especially younger generations, into our restaurants.”A timeline for Impossible's release of its bacon isn't yet known."We’re not going to release a bacon product until we feel like anyone who is the most hardcore bacon worshipper thinks it’s awesomely delicious," Brown said. "It’s going to be an epic moment when we serve the first kosher bacon cheeseburger. I think that'll probably be THE most epic moment in the plant-based food movement." Brown didn't want to announce what the company's next product would be Monday."I’ll just say that there are some that are obvious from the environmental standpoint," Brown said, noting fish and seafood are a high priority. "If it’s a food that comes from animals today, you can be sure that people on our R&D team are working on a more delicious, healthier and vastly more sustainable plant-based alternative."Brown also made a prediction Monday. By 2035, he said, "animals as a food production technology are gonna be history."CES 2020: Four cool gadgets that already caught our attentionWhat to expect at CES 2020: Ivanka Trump, flying cars, sex toys and 8K TVs – oh my!Follow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTykoThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: CES 2020: Impossible Foods launching plant-based pork, sausageReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWallaby Higginbotham has 'no complaints' over leaders Bordeaux-Begles' seasonAFPBeyond Meat Earnings Miss, Stock Falls Despite Upbeat Sales ForecastInvestor's Business DailyBeyond Meat narrows 4Q loss as plant-based meat sales jumpAssociated PressBeyond Meat posts profit miss, dragged by investment, marketing costs; shares fallReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
