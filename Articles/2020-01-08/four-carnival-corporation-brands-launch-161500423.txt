Enchanted Princess is designed from the ground up as a Princess MedallionClass ship. Costa Firenze is Costa Cruises' second ship designed and built specifically for the China market. Mardi Gras is named as a tribute to TSS Mardi Gras, Carnival Cruise Line's first-ever ship, which marked a historic turning point in accelerating growth in the popularity of modern-day cruising.P&O Cruises' Iona and Carnival Cruise Line's Mardi Gras will be the third and fourth (respectively) of Carnival Corporation's 11 total next-generation cruise ships joining the fleet through 2025 that can be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), the industry's most advanced fuel technology, eliminating sulfur and significantly improving overall air emissions.Part of Carnival Corporation's strategy of measured capacity growth, each new ship provides an opportunity to introduce new guest innovations, energy efficiencies and sustainability approaches to cruising, while creating excitement, meeting growing demand and generating consideration of cruising as an extraordinary vacation at an exceptional value. The introduction of the four new ships in 2020 is part of Carnival Corporation's ongoing fleet enhancement strategy, with 16 new ships scheduled to be delivered through 2025, designed to continue improving the overall guest experience while accelerating demand for cruising, the fastest growing segment in the vacation industry.These new ships build on the momentum of Carnival Corporation's four new vessels launched with rave reviews in 2019 – Carnival Cruise Line's Carnival Panorama, Costa Cruises' Costa Smeralda and Costa Venezia, and Sky Princess from Princess Cruises."Each new ship is an opportunity to generate excitement and buzz among consumers around the world, whether loyal guests or new to cruising, that will continue to inspire more travelers to consider cruising as a vacation option," said Roger Frizzell, chief communications officer for Carnival Corporation. "We look forward to the delivery of four more spectacular ships, which will offer our guests the latest in onboard features and amenities – and help us continue our reputation for providing great cruise vacations that are significantly less than comparable land-based vacations."Below is a brief look at Carnival Corporation's four new ships for 2020:Iona from P&O Cruises (UK) – May 2020When Iona joins the P&O Cruises (UK) fleet in May, it will launch as the popular British line's first LNG-powered ship. Among the distinguishing characteristics of Iona will be the Grand Atrium, a new development for the cruise line with uninterrupted panoramic views of the sea, framed by glazed walls stretching three decks high. Located at the heart of Iona, the glazed Grand Atrium is a lively focal point that encapsulates the spirit of the ship, with each level offering natural light and breath-taking views.Iona's distinct "crown" will be the SkyDome, a new entertainment venue on the top two levels of the ship and capped by a glass-domed roof designed by award-winning British engineers Eckersley O'Callaghan, the team behind glass masterpieces such as London's Embassy Gardens Sky Pool and Bulgari's flagship New York boutique. SkyDome's unique event space offers an ideal place for relaxation and informal dining during the day, transitioning into vibrant evening activities, including spectacular aerial performances, immersive shows and deck parties.Story continuesWith a choice of 30 different bar and restaurant venues, Iona's guests will enjoy the widest ever selection of places to eat and drink on a ship built exclusively for the British cruise holiday market. Innovative and flexible dining options include a "foodie" market offering cuisine from around the world, a new gastropub concept and a laid-back cocktail lounge.As part of the new approach to dining, Iona will for the first time offer Freedom Dining in all of its main restaurants, giving guests more flexibility for dining. As with other ships in the P&O Cruises fleet, Iona will have The Retreat, a private, open-air deck area where cold flannels, chilled drinks, snacks and al fresco spa treatments are offered in the privacy of shaded cabanas. Iona's Retreat will also have two infinity whirlpools.  Another new offering is the spa's variety of destination-themed treatments with locally inspired therapies incorporated into the experience. Cruise guests might choose from rejuvenating options such as the Nordic Cleanse or the Baltic & Ice Massage, inspired by the Nordic heritage of hot and cold therapies.Upon launch in May 2020, Iona will sail from Southampton, United Kingdom, exclusively to the Norwegian Fjords during the inaugural season with departures throughout spring and summer 2020, followed by winter sun holidays to the Canaries, Spain and Portugal.Enchanted Princess from Princess Cruises – June 2020Debuting in Rome (Civitavecchia) in June 2020, the 3,660-guest Enchanted Princess shares all of the spectacular style and luxury of its sister ships – Regal Princess, Royal Princess, Majestic Princess and the recently launched Sky Princess. Guests will discover exquisite, one-of-a-kind dining experiences, more pools and whirlpool hot tubs and world-class entertainment venues hosting dazzling performances. The ship also will feature breathtaking Sky Suites, with expansive views from the largest balconies at sea, which originally debuted on Sky Princess in October 2019.           Measuring 1,012 square feet (starboard side Sky Suite) and 947 square feet (port side Sky Suite), the furnished balconies will provide a private vantage of the ship's Movie Under the Stars screen and create the ultimate space for entertaining. The two suites will also offer 270-degree panorama views and have sleeping capacity for five guests, and more room for gathering – making them ideal for families. Before Sky Suite guests board their cruise ship, they can take advantage of a pre-cruise, shoreside concierge.
