Getting digital right will sort the winners from the losers."Front office functions were the biggest focus of digital investments, with 35 percent of respondents giving top priority to marketing, sales and distribution, while 32 percent prioritised their investment activities. Fifty-three percent of top executives rated these investments as 'high value'.By contrast, just over one in five respondents put the most effort into digitising back office control and support functions (e.g. risk, compliance), and even fewer gave priority to middle office functions (e.g. operations). Only 42 percent of respondents said their investments for middle office functions showed 'high value', others either said they were of 'debatable value' or 'low value'.Most top executives (38 percent) named "poorly defined benefits and target outcomes" as a limiting factor for their digital strategies.Vivian Chui, Partner, Head of Securities & Asset Management in Hong Kong, KPMG China, said, "Asset management leaders need to have a clear sense of the benefits from their digital strategy and these should be clearly communicated across the entire organisation."When asked what factors drove the success of their digital strategy, "having a clear vision for the program" was by far the most common answer (56 percent).Neil Macdonald, Head of Wealth and Asset Management Centre of Excellence (CoE), KPMG China, said, "It's clear from our research that the digital winners have embedded digitisation in all their strategic and operational plans. For some managers, it may be time to press pause on their current digital efforts; taking time out to ensure that their digital portfolio is aligned with their business strategy and that their data program is providing a solid foundation for the effort is likely to increase significantly their chances of 'Getting Digital Right'."About KPMG ChinaKPMG member firms and its affiliates operating in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau are collectively referred to as "KPMG China".
