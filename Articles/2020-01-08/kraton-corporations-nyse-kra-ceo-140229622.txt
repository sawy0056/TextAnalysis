This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. Check out our latest analysis for Kraton How Does Kevin Fogarty's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?At the time of writing, our data says that Kraton Corporation has a market cap of US$753m, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$5.4m for the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$981k. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations from US$400m to US$1.6b, and the median CEO total compensation was US$2.6m.It would therefore appear that Kraton Corporation pays Kevin Fogarty more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. A closer look at the performance of the underlying business will give us a better idea about whether the pay is particularly generous.The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at Kraton has changed from year to year.NYSE:KRA CEO Compensation, January 7th 2020MoreIs Kraton Corporation Growing?Kraton Corporation has increased its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 6.5% a year, over the last three years (using a line of best fit).

As discussed above, we discovered that the company pays more than the median of that group.The growth in the business has been uninspiring, but the shareholder returns have arguably been worse, over the last three years.
