If another city has, for example, a rent index of 120, it means that rents in that city are 20% more expensive, on average, than in New York City. If a city has a rent index of 70, rents average 30% below that of New York City. The five indices include: (1) the cost-of-living index, which is the relative indicator of consumer goods prices, including groceries, restaurants, transportation and utilities (does not include rent or mortgage expenses); (2) the rent index, which is an estimate of apartment rental prices in the city compared to New York City; (3) the grocery index, which is an estimation of grocery prices in the city compared to New York City; (4) the restaurant index, which is a comparison of prices of meals and drinks in restaurants and bars compared to New York City; and (5) local purchasing power, which shows the relative purchasing power in buying goods and services in a given city for the average wage in that city. If domestic purchasing power is 40, this means that the inhabitants of that city with the average salary can afford to buy, on average, 60% less goods and services than New York City residents with an average salary. Data was sourced from Numbeo on April 5, 2018, and all percentages are approximations.
