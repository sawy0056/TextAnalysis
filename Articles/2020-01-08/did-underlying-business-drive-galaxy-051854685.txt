The company should be really proud of that performance! View our latest analysis for Galaxy Resources Galaxy Resources wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.In the last 5 years Galaxy Resources saw its revenue grow at 59% per year. Even measured against other revenue-focussed companies, that's a good result. Arguably, this is well and truly reflected in the strong share price gain of 47%(per year) over the same period. Despite the strong run, top performers like Galaxy Resources have been known to go on winning for decades. On the face of it, this looks lke a good opportunity, although we note sentiment seems very positive already.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).ASX:GXY Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year.
