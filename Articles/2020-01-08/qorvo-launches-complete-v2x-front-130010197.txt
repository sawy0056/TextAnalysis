The product suite provides a readily available solution for V2X communications as 286 million connected passenger cars are forecast to be added globally from 2019 to 2025.1V2X is an umbrella term for vehicle technology that allows the car to communicate with the environment around it, where information from sensors and other sources travels via low-latency, high-reliability links, paving the way to fully autonomous driving. There are several components of V2X, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) and vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications.The Qorvo V2X suite includes the first Band 47/Wi-Fi bulk acoustic wave (BAW) coexistence filter, which enables Wi-Fi coexistence with the V2X 5.9 GHz band. This capability is critical to establishing reliable links between vehicles and their surroundings. It also includes two integrated front-end modules (FEMs) that support C-V2X and DSRC systems, a digital step attenuator, transmit/receive switch and low noise amplifier.Gorden Cook, GM, Qorvo's Transport business unit, said, “Qorvo is the only company to offer a chipset-agnostic solution to enable a robust V2X link with adequate transmit linear power and best receive performance in the presence of Wi-Fi. Qorvo’s new BAW filter, the QPQ2200Q, is an important part of the system line-up in autonomous cars, where Wi-Fi and V2X will coexist.”The following products in Qorvo’s V2X suite are sampling to qualified customers. QPF1002Q Front-end module designed and optimized to support C-V2X systems; integrates PA, LNA and switching in a compact 5.0mm x 4.0mm package
