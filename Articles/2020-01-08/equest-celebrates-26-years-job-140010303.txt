There were no smartphones, no iPads, no flat-screen TVs. No Google, no Netflix, no Dropbox. Instead of Wi-Fi, most people used paid, dial-up online services like AOL. And you paid for every minute you used it.Nevertheless, 1994 was a momentous year. It was the year the World Wide Web – or the internet as we know it today -- was born. It was also the year that eQuest began its 26 year journey.“We started doing two things: Collecting technical resumes for basic recruiter searching, and posting jobs to Usenet and BBS groups,” said Derek Fuentes, programmer/developer, and a 17 year veteran at eQuest. “We relied mostly on fax machines, direct dial-up, and driving from city to city collecting hard copy resumes at career fairs. Later that year, a few job boards started, such as Online Career Center (OCC), Monster, and CareerMosaic. It was the Wild West back then.”Since 1994, eQuest has provided domestic and international job posting delivery for thousands of customers worldwide to thousands of commercial job boards, colleges, universities, social media, diversity and federally mandated career sites, and niche job boards.
