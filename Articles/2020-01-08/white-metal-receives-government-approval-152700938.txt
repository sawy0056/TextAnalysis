(TSXV: WHM) ("White Metal" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has received from the Namibian Government (Ministry of Environment and Tourism), the required Environmental Clearance Certificates ("ECC") for Exclusive Prospecting License ("EPL") 7071 (the "Taranis Property") and EPLs 7028, 7029, and 7030 (the "Altan" or "DorWit Property"), clearing the way for the Company to begin its exploration programs in Namibia. The Company is planning to complete several geophysical surveys and drilling programs in the coming months. The Taranis and DorWit properties are held by White Metal's 100% owned Namibian subsidiary companies Aloe 238 and Aloe 237, respectively (see Company news release dated June 18, 2019).Michael Stares, Interim President & CEO of the Company, stated, "I am very encouraged to have received the EEC clearance from the Namibian Government and now we can begin planning the work programs to advance the properties."The Taranis Property (EPL 7071), covering about 19,850 ha, includes the Okohongo Copper-Silver Deposit ("Okohongo Project") which has been outlined by historical drilling, showing it extends over 600 metres in strike length, 400 metres down-dip, and is open in all directions (see INV Metals news release dated August 3, 2011). The Okohongo deposit, situated within the Kaoko Belt of northwest Namibia about 700 km northwest of Windhoek, is hosted by metasedimentary stratigraphy and is considered to be analogous with the stratiform sediment-hosted Central African Copperbelt deposits of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This deposit contains historical Inferred Mineral Resources of 10.2 million tonnes grading 1.12% Cu and 17.75 g/t Ag, using a 0.3% Cu cut-off (Table 1; INV Metals Inc. NI 43-101 Technical Report, Effective Date March 31, 2011).Table 1. Historical Mineral Resources for the Okohongo Copper-Silver Project, Namibia.

source: NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Okohongo Copper-Silver Property in Northwest Namibia, INV Metals Inc.; Prepared By: Caracle Creek International Consulting (Pty) Ltd., South Africa, Effective March 31, 2011.Management of the Company is relying on the Inferred Mineral Resource estimation reported in Table 1 for the Okohongo Copper-Silver Deposit as it was prepared by expert and qualified authors and used industry standard procedures (NI 43-101) at that time. This resource estimate is relevant to the Company's future exploration programs as it identifies significant mineralization that will be the target of future exploration and development.The DorWit Property (EPLs 7028, 7029, and 7030), subject to a binding letter of intent with RZJ Capital Management LLC (see Company news release dated October 16, 2019), is located about 150 km east of Windhoek, the capital city of Namibia. The Property covers about 65 km of prospective stratigraphy on the Namibian portion of the Kalahari Copper Belt, which extends eastward into Botswana, a region of active copper exploration and development (e.g., Cupric Canyon Capital; Kalahari Metals Ltd.; MOD Resources Ltd.).Six historical copper deposits occur within the DorWit Property along with other zones with anomalous copper in historical drill core intercepts that the Company believes can be expanded upon through further exploration. Historical resource estimates contained within the Property were published by the Geological Survey of Namibia (Resources of Namibia, 1999) and are summarized in Table 2.Table 2. Historical Mineral Resources from the Dordabis-Witvlei areas, Namibia.
