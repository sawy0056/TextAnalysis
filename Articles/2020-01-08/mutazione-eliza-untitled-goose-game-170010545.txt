Die Gute Fabrik’s “mutant soap opera” adventure game is set more than 100 years after a meteor strikes a tropical island resort and the surviving inhabitants create a small isolated community known as Mutazione. As 15-year-old Kai, players set out on a quest where the juicy personal drama is just as important as the high-stakes adventure, and young Kai must care for her ailing grandfather while navigating her personal life and uncovering the secrets of the island.The nominees for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize also include:Untitled Goose Game, a game where players inhabit the webbed feet of a troublesome goose wreaking (playful) havoc on unwitting townsfolk, which earned an additional nomination for Audio.A Short Hike, a vibrant exploration game set in the wilds of Hawk Peak Provincial Park, which also received a nomination for Design.Eliza, an enthralling visual novel that draws on themes of personal connection and technological encroachment, received a nod for Narrative as well.Slay the Spire, an addictive card game that incorporates dynamic roguelike game elements and deckbuilding, had its full release in 2019 and has received a second nomination for Design.Anodyne 2: Return to Dust, an action adventure game with a charming story and a retro visual design that draws from the eras of 16-bit and 32-bit consoles.Other titles earning multiple nominations include Knights and Bikes, a colorfully hand-painted coming-of-age adventure by Foam Sword Games, which earned nominations for Excellence in Visual Art and Audio. In addition, Elsinore, a time-looping creative reimagination of Shakespeare’s Hamlet from the perspective of Ophelia, is up for the awards for Excellence in Design and Narrative.The winners of the IGF will be announced at the Independent Games Festival Awards, which takes place the evening of Wednesday, March 18, 2020 at San Francisco’s Moscone Convention Center.
