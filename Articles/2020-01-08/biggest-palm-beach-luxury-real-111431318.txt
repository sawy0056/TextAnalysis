Ocean Blvd, according to the Palm Beach Post. Miller, the co-founder of hair-and-beauty products brand Matrix Essentials, sold the 4.5-acre oceanfront estate on "Billionaires Row" – south of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort – in December to hedge-fund billionaire Steven Schonfeld and his wife Brooke Schonfeld.The 70,000-square-foot property, known as La Reverie, has 11 bedrooms, 22 bathrooms, a tennis court and an ice cream stand, the Wall Street Journal reported.The ultra-luxury real estate market in Palm Beach is still sizzling, partly due to a 2017 tax law that imposed a $10,000 cap on local and state tax deductions in other markets like New York, WSJ reported. This has caused some one-percenters to seek out property in places like Palm Beach, real estate experts suggest."It's part of the migration pattern that's developing from the Northeast to Florida. It's not just Palm Beach that's seeing an influx," Jonathan Miller, president and CEO of Miller Samuel Inc., a real estate appraisal and consulting firm, told FOX Business adding that the Palm Beach super-luxury market isn't dependent on international buyers but rather owners looking for high-end second homes.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREA few doors down at 1295 S.
