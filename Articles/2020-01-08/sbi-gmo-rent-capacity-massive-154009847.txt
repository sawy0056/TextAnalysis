The firms are to begin mining “within coming months,” the report says, adding that the firms involved would not comment when asked.As CoinDesk reported in November, when the facility gets up and running it will likely be the biggest bitcoin mine in the world, starting at 300 megawatts and expanding to 1 gigawatt by the end of 2020.Related: Bitcoin Mining Power Hits Fresh All-Time HighThat puts the rival mine being built by Bitmain – also in Rockdale and touted as the biggest in the world – in the shade. That’s planned to start at a capacity of 25-50 MW and possibly expand to 300 MW.Internet giant GMO was also said to have been involved in setting up the Rockdale facility, as per CoinDesk’s earlier report. In November, Whinstone estimated the data center will cost $150 million to build and fit out. The initial 300 MW of power was expected to come online in the first quarter, with 1 GW planned to be achieved late in the year.Soon after Whinstone broke ground on its Texas project the company was acquired by Germany-based Northern Bitcoin, which already runs a bitcoin mine in Norway that harnesses renewable power. Similarly, Texas may have been chosen as the site for this major venture in part due to its availability of cheap wind power, according to Bloomberg.Related StoriesLawsuit Shows How a Public Firm’s $80M Bet on Bitcoin Miners Went Terribly WrongRipple Raises $200M in Series-C Round Led by TetragonGSR Partners With Canaan-Tied Startup to Offer Crypto Miners DerivativesReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
