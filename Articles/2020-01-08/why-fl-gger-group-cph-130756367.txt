To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Flügger group:0.065 = ø69m ÷ (ø1.5b - ø419m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2019.)Therefore, Flügger group has an ROCE of 6.5%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. If Flügger group is cyclical, it could make sense to check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.Flügger group's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCELiabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Flügger group has total liabilities of ø419m and total assets of ø1.5b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 28% of its total assets. This very reasonable level of current liabilities would not boost the ROCE by much.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Flügger group's ROCEThat said, Flügger group's ROCE is mediocre, there may be more attractive investments around.
