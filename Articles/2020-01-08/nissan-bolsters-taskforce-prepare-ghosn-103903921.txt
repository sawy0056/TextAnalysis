Nissan has denied this, and is bracing for more such allegations."Now that he has escaped, he can say anything he wants and will keep throwing mud at us until people prove him otherwise," one company executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity."The more sympathy he gets from the media and general public, the stronger his leverage over the Lebanese government to protect him."The Nissan <7201.T> taskforce was set up shortly after Ghosn's arrest to deal with "anything Ghosn-related," as one source put it - a testament to the significance of a man who forged the company's alliance with French carmaker Renault <RENA.PA> and presided over it for almost two decades.The taskforce is led by Chief Executive Makoto Uchida and has recently been reinforced with the inclusion of former acting CEO Yasuhiro Yamauchi and former senior executive Hitoshi Kawaguchi, the sources said.Both former executives were previously close allies of Ghosn and while they stepped down in a recent management shake-up they remain employed at Nissan as advisers.Ghosn’s flight from Japan presents a fresh distraction for Nissan at a time when Uchida and his newly-installed management are trying to turn around a business hit by plunging profits, collapsing sales in the United States and tensions with Renault.The sources said most members of Nissan's executive committee were not receiving information from the taskforce to allow them to focus on day-to-day operations and the turnaround.(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Mark Potter)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergJapan minister flying to Lebanon to make case for Ghosn's returnReutersJapan to send vice justice minister to Lebanon after Ghosn escapeAFPJapan scrambles for workarounds after Abe urges March school shutdown to stem coronavirusReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
