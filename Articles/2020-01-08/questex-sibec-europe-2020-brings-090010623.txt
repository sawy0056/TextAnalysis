This iconic property is the definition of style and luxury and is the perfect platform for delegates to conduct business away from the pressures of the office. SIBEC has facilitated over 50,000 meetings over the years between international suppliers and Europe's most prominent fitness operators. Choosing exotic locations enhances the SIBEC experience and sets the tone for great networking and everlasting friendships. Ultimately people do business with people they like and we firmly believe SIBEC forms those friendships which translate into business.”  "As we try to balance increasingly busy work schedules, I continue to find that SIBEC Europe provides me with the perfect opportunity to meet new and existing suppliers in a focused environment, which maximises the opportunity for both buyers and suppliers.
