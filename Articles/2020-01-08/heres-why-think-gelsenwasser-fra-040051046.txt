And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Gelsenwasser (FRA:WWG). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Gelsenwasser Gelsenwasser's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price will eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Gelsenwasser managed to grow EPS by 8.2% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note Gelsenwasser's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 50% to €2.2b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So check Gelsenwasser's balance sheet strength, before getting too excited.Are Gelsenwasser Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I always like to check up on CEO compensation, because I think that reasonable pay levels, around or below the median, can be a sign that shareholder interests are well considered. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Gelsenwasser with market caps between €1.8b and €5.7b is about €1.9m.Gelsenwasser offered total compensation worth €1.2m to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Gelsenwasser Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Gelsenwasser is that it is growing profits. Not only that, but the CEO is paid quite reasonably, which makes me feel more trusting of the board of directors. So I do think the stock deserves further research, if not instant addition to your watchlist. Of course, just because Gelsenwasser is growing does not mean it is undervalued.
