Over its 20-year history, ABHC has built a reputation amongst the health care and legal community that is second to none."Associated Behavioral Health is among a handful of companies in the country that provide all facets of behavioral health care. ABHC's CEO Alex Bard and his team of acclaimed professionals has created one of the Northwest's largest providers of psychiatry, psychology, psych testing, TMS, chemical dependency counseling and assessments, domestic violence and medication management services," says Joe Tinervin, MSW, Division President at Discovery Behavioral Health.The acquisition of ABHC comes at a time when the national opioid crisis continues to engulf the nation and specifically, the Pacific Northwest.
