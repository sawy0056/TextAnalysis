The Company plans to present its plan for Phase 3 clinical studies and licensure. VLA1553 has been awarded Fast Track designation by the FDA and may be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher1.Wolfgang Bender, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Valneva, commented, “We are extremely pleased that the FDA has accepted our proposal for an EOP2 meeting. Subject to the outcome we may commence Phase 3 clinical trials within a few months. We are strongly committed to advancing VLA1553, currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate in clinical development showing fully sustained titers one year after a single vaccination, through the accelerated approval.”In November 2019, Valneva reported final Phase 1 results confirming VLA1553’s excellent immunogenicity and safety profile2.The Company has also completed all required non-clinical studies requested by the FDA.About the Phase 1 Clinical Study VLA1553-101This study was a randomized, observer-blinded, multicenter, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical study investigating three dose levels of VLA1553, administered as a single immunization. It enrolled 120 healthy volunteers, 18 to 45 years of age, in the United States. Subjects were randomized into three different study groups to receive one of three dose levels (30 subjects in the low and medium and 60 subjects in the high dose group). The protocol includes a re-vaccination with the live-attenuated vaccine candidate VLA1553 at Month 6 (for 30 subjects in the high dose group) or Month 12 (for all others) to confirm that a single vaccination will be sufficient to induce high titer neutralizing antibodies and protect subjects from vaccine-induced viremia (intrinsic viral challenge). Study participants were followed until 13 months after initial vaccination. An independent Drug Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) continuously oversaw the study and reviewed safety data. Additional information, including a detailed description of the study design, eligibility criteria and investigator sites, is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03382964).About Chikungunya Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a Togaviridae virus, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever, debilitating joint and muscle pain, headache, nausea and rash, potentially developing into long-term, serious health impairments. Chikungunya virus causes clinical illness in 72-92% of infected humans around 4 to 7 days after an infected mosquito bite. Complications resulting from the disease include visual, neurological, heart and gastrointestinal manifestations; fatalities have been reported (case fatality rates of 0.1% to 4.9% from epidemics)3 in elderly patients at higher risk. Chikungunya outbreaks have been reported in Asia, Africa, the Americas and recently (2017) in Europe. As of 2017, there have been more than one million reported cases in the Americas4  and the economic impact is considered to be significant (e.g. Colombia outbreak 2014: $73.6m5). The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to further spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and, as such, chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a monovalent, single dose, live-attenuated vaccine candidate for protection against chikungunya and was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 20186.The vaccine candidate is designed for prophylactic, active, single-dose immunization against chikungunya in humans over one year old. The vaccine targets long-lasting protection and an anticipated safety profile similar to licensed vaccines for active immunization in adults and children. The target population segments are travelers, military personnel and individuals at risk living in endemic regions. The global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated at up to €500 million annually7.Story continuesVLA1553 is based on an infectious clone (CHIKV LR2006-OPY1) attenuated by deleting a major part of the gene encoding the non-structural replicase complex protein nsP3, aiming for protection against various chikungunya virus outbreak phylogroups and strains8.In pre-clinical development, a single-vaccine shot was shown to be highly immunogenic in vaccinated Non-Human Primates (NHP) (cynomolgus macaques) and showed no signs of viremia after challenge9. In NHPs, VLA1553 induced a strong, long lasting (more than 300 days) neutralizing antibody response comparable to wild-type CHIKV infections, combined with a good safety profile.About Valneva SEValneva is a biotech company developing and commercializing vaccines for infectious diseases with major unmet needs. Valneva’s portfolio includes two commercial vaccines for travelers: IXIARO®/JESPECT® indicated for the prevention of Japanese encephalitis and DUKORAL® indicated for the prevention of cholera and, in some countries, prevention of diarrhea caused by ETEC. The Company has various vaccines in development including a unique vaccine against Lyme disease. Valneva has operations in Austria, Sweden, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and the US with approximately 490 employees. More information is available at www.valneva.com.
