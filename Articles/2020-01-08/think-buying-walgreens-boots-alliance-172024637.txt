(NASDAQ:WBA) Now?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 7, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we're going to take a look at the well-established Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Walgreens Boots Alliance’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance What's the opportunity in Walgreens Boots Alliance?Great news for investors – Walgreens Boots Alliance is still trading at a fairly cheap price. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 13.79x is currently well-below the industry average of 23.04x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Walgreens Boots Alliance’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from Walgreens Boots Alliance?NasdaqGS:WBA Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.
