To keep it practical, we'll show how Tan Chong International Limited's (HKG:693) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer.

Check out our latest analysis for Tan Chong International How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Tan Chong International:P/E of 12.22 = HK$2.13 ÷ HK$0.17 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Tan Chong International Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. As you can see below Tan Chong International has a P/E ratio that is fairly close for the average for the retail distributors industry, which is 11.9.SEHK:693 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreThat indicates that the market expects Tan Chong International will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Tan Chong International shrunk earnings per share by 32% over the last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 11% per year over the last three years. And EPS is down 12% a year, over the last 5 years. This could justify a pessimistic P/E.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does Tan Chong International's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?With net cash of HK$1.3b, Tan Chong International has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 31% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On Tan Chong International's P/E RatioTan Chong International trades on a P/E ratio of 12.2, which is above its market average of 10.7. The recent drop in earnings per share might keep value investors away, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: and the high P/E suggests the market thinks it will.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
