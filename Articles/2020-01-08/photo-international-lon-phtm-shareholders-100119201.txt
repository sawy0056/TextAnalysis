But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been less than pleasing. After all, the share price is down 43% in the last three years, significantly under-performing the market. Check out our latest analysis for Photo-Me International While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Although the share price is down over three years, Photo-Me International actually managed to grow EPS by 1.1% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.After considering the numbers, we'd posit that the the market had higher expectations of EPS growth, three years back. Looking to other metrics might better explain the share price change.We note that the dividend seems healthy enough, so that probably doesn't explain the share price drop. It's good to see that Photo-Me International has increased its revenue over the last three years. But it's not clear to us why the share price is down. It might be worth diving deeper into the fundamentals, lest an opportunity goes begging.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).LSE:PHTM Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Photo-Me International's TSR for the last 3 years was -30%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectivePhoto-Me International shareholders have received returns of 20% over twelve months (even including dividends) , which isn't far from the general market return. The silver lining is that the share price is up in the short term, which flies in the face of the annualised loss of 1.8% over the last five years.
