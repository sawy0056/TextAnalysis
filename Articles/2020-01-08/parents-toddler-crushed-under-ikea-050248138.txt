Ikea paid $50 million to three families in a court settlement in 2016, whose young children similarly lost their lives to the MALM dresser.0See more from BenzingaPier 1 Shares Plummet As Company Shuts Down 450 Stores, Sales DeclineBed Bath & Beyond Sells Half Its Real-Estate In An Effort To Turn Around BusinessEurope Stocks, US Futures Extend Losses Over Middle East Tensions Following US Strikes© 2020 Benzinga.com.
