By raising outside capital, Left has more firepower to go after some of the biggest U.S. companies.Citron has not disclosed the size of its hedge fund.For this year, Left said RH, whose stock price closed at $212.77 on Monday, may be bought. "We believe the company has matured to a point that we might see it acquired in 2020."He also said he is sticking by his bet that shares in Peloton Interactive, whose stock closed at $29.75 on Monday, will fall. "Citron put a one-year price target of $5 and we stand by it as $5 makes this still a $1.5 billion company."Neither RH nor Peloton responded immediately to emails seeking comment.Left also gave investors lessons that he learned last year; reminding himself and others to stay away from what he calls "big story 'cult stock'" companies and sticking with what he does best: exposing fraud.He also said that this year will be a year of growth and that he is looking to expand beyond his home base in Los Angeles.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss with additional reporting by Lawrence Delevingne; editing by Richard Pullin)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHow investors are using ‘alternative’ data to track China’s recovery from coronaviruMarketWatchThe Great Exodus Out of Hedge FundsInvestopediaBillionaire Ken Griffin Pulls the Trigger on 3 “Strong Buy” StocksTipRanksRace to the Bottom: How a Renewable Fund Failed in the ESG BoomBloombergInvesting in Direct Participation Programs (DPPs)SmartAssetBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
