All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Bonava's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. The image below shows that Bonava has a lower P/E than the average (16.5) P/E for companies in the consumer durables industry.OM:BONAV B Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreBonava's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Bonava shrunk earnings per share by 13% over the last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 18%.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Bonava's Balance SheetBonava's net debt is 68% of its market cap. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you should absolutely keep in mind it has significant borrowings.The Verdict On Bonava's P/E RatioBonava's P/E is 10.8 which is below average (19.3) in the SE market. Given meaningful debt, and a lack of recent growth, the market looks to be extrapolating this recent performance; reflecting low expectations for the future.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
