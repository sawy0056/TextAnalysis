That brought the twelve month gain to a very sharp 96%.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio.

Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.ACM Research's 104% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. Unfortunately, earnings per share are down 17% a year, over 5 years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.ACM Research's Balance SheetACM Research has net cash of US$32m. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.The Bottom Line On ACM Research's P/E RatioACM Research trades on a P/E ratio of 19.8, which is fairly close to the US market average of 18.8.
