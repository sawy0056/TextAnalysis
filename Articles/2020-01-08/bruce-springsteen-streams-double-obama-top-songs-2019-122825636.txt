Songs from less mainstream singers, like Angélique Kidjo’s cover of “La Vida Es Un Carnaval,” saw even larger boosts, with Kidjo’s track earning a 2700% jump in streams during the 48 hours after making the list.Ten artists listed on Obama's favorite songs of 2019 list saw substantial spikes in streams in the two days after he tweeted his list compared to the two days prior. Streams of "Hello Sunshine" by The Boss more than doubled.MoreOverall, songs that made the list saw streams on services like Spotify (SPOT) and Apple (AAPL) Music spiked an average of 20% when comparing the two days before Obama named his favorite songs to the two days that followed.Other songs seeing impressive spikes in streaming included Raleigh, North Carolina-based rapper LesTheGenius’ “Raleighwood Hills,” which saw a jump of more than 1800% and The National’s “Oblivions,” which was streamed more than three times as much after earning the Obama nod.
From hip-hop to country to The Boss, here are my songs of the year. If you’re looking for something to keep you company on a long drive or help you turn up a workout, I hope there’s a track or two in here that does the trick. pic.twitter.com/mQ2VssyDwt— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 30, 2019 However, it’s not the first time that a mention from a president has been able to influence how a song performs. Last year, President Donald Trump boosted streams of Nickelback’s “Photograph” by more than 569% after tweeting a doctored clip of the band’s music video. And even Obama’s top summer music playlist boosted all of the 44 songs earning a place on that list, according to Billboard’s reporting at the time citing Nielsen data.Zack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
