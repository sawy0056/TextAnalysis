"The fact that an organization based in Mexico would want to work with a marketing agency in Portland speaks to how broad our reach has become."It's not the first time that Trueline has partnered with large nonprofits. Since 2017, the company has been working closely with the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), a 10,000-member organization committed to advancing the cause of Hispanics in STEM (short for science, technology, engineering and math).The company's clientele also includes Good-Will Hinckley, a Maine-based charitable organization dedicated to providing educational and other resources to children in need; Community Action of Strafford County (NH), for which Trueline created a new website and annual report; and the Institute for Humane Education, a nonprofit which advocates for a more holistic, nature-focused approach to education."Helping nonprofits increase their visibility has become a big part of who we are," Carr says. "The work of these and other organizations needs to be recognized, and we're very excited to make it an even bigger focus of ours moving forward."Trueline is a full-service branding, marketing and consulting agency that has been named one of the "Best Places to Work in Maine" four consecutive years. In June 2019, the company relocated to its new office at 561 Congress Street in Portland, taking over a space once occupied by the SALT Institute for Documentary Studies.For more information about Trueline, please visit http://www.wearetrueline.com SOURCE TruelineReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBeyond Meat posts profit miss, dragged by investment, marketing costs; shares fallReutersNWSL hires Lisa Baird, former US Olympic marketing chief, as commissionerYahoo SportsSiteOne Landscape Supply adds Lowe's veteran to its C-SuiteAmerican City Business Journals3 “Strong Buy” Stocks Holding Steady Amid Coronavirus ConcernsTipRanksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
