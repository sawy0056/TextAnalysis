One of HIMKI's annual event is the Indonesia International Furniture Expo (IFEX) that has been successful in introducing and promoting Indonesian quality furniture to the global audience. In 12-15 March 2020, HIMKI is scheduled to host this largest business-to-business (B2B) furniture exhibition in Indonesia and the region. Dyandra Promosindo is also one of the organizers of this event. The furniture industry is still regarded as one of the main backbones for the Indonesian economy. The industry absorbs a huge amount of human resources and the number is increasing from time to time. The data from the Ministry of Industry shows an increase in furniture export value. Last year, Indonesian furniture export valued was recorded at US$1.69 billion. On average, the industry is experiencing a growth of 4 per cent per annum.The Indonesian furniture industry is projected to remain growing considering the country has several advantages such as the high number of human resources and abundant raw material supply. To date, Indonesian forest land reaches around 120 million hectares, of which 12 million hectares are categorized as production forests. Indonesia is also famous as the world's largest rattan producer with 312 types of rattan that the industry can utilize.To realize further growth, the country's furniture industry needs continuous innovations in terms of the design, the technology, the marketing strategy, and the after-sales service to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction. Region-wise, Indonesian furniture export is still lagging behind Vietnam, which currently sits on 7th place. Globally, the furniture export market is dominated by China followed by Germany, Italy, Poland, and the United States.The Opportunity to Increase Export.All these years, IFEX has managed to provide the medium to grow the industry. It attracts thousands of buyers and visitors and offers a golden opportunity to local industry players to exhibit their best products to these international audiences. Last year, IFEX managed to draw 12 thousand visitors and recorded an on-the-spot transaction of US$370 million.Besides promoting the growth of Indonesian furniture industry, one of IFEX 2020 targets is to take advantage of the US market that is left by China due to the trade war between the two countries. In addition to Europe, the US is one of the major export destinations for Indonesian furniture products. Soenoto says Indonesia is not the only country to target the US market. He, therefore, encourages the country's industry players to find the right strategy to win the US market that was previously dominated by Chinese products.   About HIMKIHIMKI is the result of the merger of two previous organizations in furniture and craft industry namely AMKRI and ASMINDO.
