The imitation pork sausage will be sold in a toasted breakfast croissant, called the Impossible Croissan’wich, with egg and cheese."The number of people who are eating pork from pigs is humongous and the fraction of that market that is captured by plant-based products is tiny," Pat Brown, the chief executive of Impossible Foods, told Reuters in a recent interview.Pork has been the world's most consumed meat for the past four decades, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Impossible Foods on Monday also announced another imitation ground pork product, but did not disclose details about where it would be produced or sold.The company has been called out by analysts for selling only one type of plant-based meat since 2016, when it launched its burger.Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat has used imitation pork, chicken and beef to create products for major fast-food chains including burgers for McDonald's <MCD.N>, sausage patties for Dunkin Brands <DNKN.O> and chicken for Yum Brands Inc's <YUM.N> KFC chain.Competition is heating up in the exploding plant-based meat market, with dozens of new products hitting grocery stores and restaurants this year. The global alternative meat market is forecast to be worth $140 billion (106.3 billion pounds) in the next decade, according to Barclays.Entering China, the world's biggest consumer of pork, is Impossible Foods' biggest priority and the company is actively looking for partners there. Plant-based imitation pork is also likely to appeal to consumers elsewhere in Asia, where Impossible currently ships to over 450 restaurants.(Reporting by Richa Naidu; Editing by Leslie Adler)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWallaby Higginbotham has 'no complaints' over leaders Bordeaux-Begles' seasonAFPBeyond Meat Earnings Miss, Stock Falls Despite Upbeat Sales ForecastInvestor's Business DailyBeyond Meat narrows 4Q loss as plant-based meat sales jumpAssociated PressBeyond Meat posts profit miss, dragged by investment, marketing costs; shares fallReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
