(NASDAQ:INVA) A Volatile Stock?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 7, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosIf you own shares in Innoviva, Inc. (NASDAQ:INVA) then it's worth thinking about how it contributes to the volatility of your portfolio, overall. In finance, Beta is a measure of volatility. Modern finance theory considers volatility to be a measure of risk, and there are two main types of price volatility. First, we have company specific volatility, which is the price gyrations of an individual stock. Holding at least 8 stocks can reduce this kind of risk across a portfolio. The second sort is caused by the natural volatility of markets, overall. For example, certain macroeconomic events will impact (virtually) all stocks on the market.Some stocks see their prices move in concert with the market. Others tend towards stronger, gentler or unrelated price movements. Some investors use beta as a measure of how much a certain stock is impacted by market risk (volatility). While we should keep in mind that Warren Buffett has cautioned that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk', beta is still a useful factor to consider. To make good use of it you must first know that the beta of the overall market is one. A stock with a beta greater than one is more sensitive to broader market movements than a stock with a beta of less than one. Check out our latest analysis for Innoviva What INVA's beta value tells investorsGiven that it has a beta of 1.51, we can surmise that the Innoviva share price has been fairly sensitive to market volatility (over the last 5 years). Based on this history, investors should be aware that Innoviva are likely to rise strongly in times of greed, but sell off in times of fear. Beta is worth considering, but it's also important to consider whether Innoviva is growing earnings and revenue. You can take a look for yourself, below.NasdaqGS:INVA Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreHow does INVA's size impact its beta?Innoviva is a small cap stock with a market capitalisation of US$1.4b. Most companies this size are actively traded. It has a relatively high beta, which is not unusual among small-cap stocks. Because it takes less capital to move the share price of a smaller company, actively traded small-cap stocks often have a higher beta that a similar large-cap stock.What this means for you:Beta only tells us that the Innoviva share price is sensitive to broader market movements. This could indicate that it is a high growth company, or is heavily influenced by sentiment because it is speculative. Alternatively, it could have operating leverage in its business model. Ultimately, beta is an interesting metric, but there's plenty more to learn.
