Industry leaders are adapting in several ways, with technology and tactical policy/product changes creating potential new growth opportunities.In a new research report, U.S. Fleet Card Market Review and Forecast, 2018–2023, Mercator Advisory Group reviews the estimated current market size and network share, projecting spending through 2023. The report delves into the issues and trends affecting this niche portion of the payments industry."The closed loop network portion of the spending continues to predominate since industry legacy approaches reside with larger fleets and the specialized controls associated with the more abundant data capabilities in these systems," commented Steve Murphy, Director of Mercator Advisory Group's Commercial and Enterprise Payments Advisory Service, author of the report. "As the service providers attempt to broaden their reach into small businesses and midsized fleets, collaboration with open loop network products will increase. This is one way to offset fuel price volatility and efficiency impacts in the shorter term, while a looming change is also there from the effects of alternative vehicles. Industry participants recognize the challenges and a need to adapt to the latest-generation technology, and there is general optimism that challenges will be met successfully."Highlights of the report include:Estimated share of closed and open loop network spending in fleet cards in the United States. Review of key challenges facing the industry service providers, including the mandate for electric logging devices (ELD) and the upcoming EMV liability shift. Projected U.S. overall open and closed loop spending through 2023.
