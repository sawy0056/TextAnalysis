It will at least know what it will get, whether they like it or don’t like it.”It was a record year for the stock market in 2019, but it might not be as great this year, Doll added.“The odd thing this year’s the economy’s likely to be a bit better than last year, but the market’s probably not going to be as good. That’s a weird juxtaposition.”A fan dressed as Super Trump holds up a sign that reads, "Super Trump 2020 Keep America Great!"

While the market has liked President Trump and his administration, stocks will continue their run higher, whether or not he gets re-elected, Doll argued. “Whether [Trump] gets elected, the bull market continues, in my view, unless and until we have a recession and there’s no sign of recession. None,” Doll said.Aside from the election, there are still key overhangs on the market including the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China and the rising tensions in the Middle East following a U.S. drone attack that killed a top Iranian general. Doll doesn’t see an end in sight when it comes to the U.S.-China trade war, even as the two feuding sides look to ink a “phase one” deal on January 15 in Washington. “The Phase One deal means we’ve got 99 phases left if we’re going to solve all of the trade problems and could go on for years.”Meanwhile, Iran remains a wildcard for the markets, according to Doll. “No question about it … Iran’s an issue. Market’s have basically ignored it as you know. I’m not sure that’s going to continue. But this one, like the China thing, is not new. We’ve been kind of fighting with Iran with words at a minimum for a long time. Let’s hope it doesn’t get a lot worse.”—Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
