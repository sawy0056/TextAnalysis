NEONs will be our friends, collaborators, and companions, continually learning, evolving, and forming memories from their interactions.”Mistry has tweeted one example of a NEON that is dressed in the signature look of the late Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs.Virtual Beings Get Real With First Emmy From HollywoodUnderpinning Samsung’s big promises is a proprietary technology platform the company is developing that’s called CORE R3, standing for Reality, Realtime and Responsive. Using neural networks and other artificial intelligence techniques, CORE R3 has been trained up with information about how humans look, behave and interact and “can computationally create lifelike reality that is beyond normal perception to distinguish,” according to STAR Labs.Samsung will be giving in-person demonstrations to CES 2020 attendees in Las Vegas this week.To contact the reporter on this story: Vlad Savov in Tokyo at vsavov5@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergStudents Step Up Protests Against Thailand’s Army-Backed PremierBloombergBaidu Becomes Latest Tech Giant to Deliver Disappointing OutlookBloombergIcahn Proposed Buying HP If It Didn’t Pursue Xerox MergerBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
