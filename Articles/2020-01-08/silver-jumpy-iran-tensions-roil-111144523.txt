Silver gained as much as 2.5% on Monday, before retracting and surrendering most of these gains. Gold showed a similar trend and gained 1.0% on the day. Gold prices touched $1588 on Monday, its highest level since April 2013. With Iran promising revenge for the killing and President Trump saying he will respond to any hostile move by Tehran, silver and gold could continue to rack up gains this week.Investors Eye Employment DataInvestors will be treated to a host of employment releases this week, which are important gauges of the health of the U.S. economy and could affect silver prices.
