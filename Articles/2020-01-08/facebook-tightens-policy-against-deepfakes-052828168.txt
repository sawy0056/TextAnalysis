The new rules won’t apply to parody or satire, however. And videos that don’t immediately meet Facebook’s internal criteria for removal may still get fact-checked by more than 50 organizations the company has partnered with worldwide. Facebook will collaborate with Reuters to help newsrooms spot deepfakes through free online courses.Facebook was widely criticized last year for not reacting faster to a widely seen video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that had been edited to make it look as though she was slurring her speech. It took Facebook more than a day to label the video as “fake,” at which point its distribution was limited by Facebook’s algorithms, but the company didn’t remove it altogether. Dozens of Democrats signed a letter to Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, accusing him of not taking the situation seriously and saying that Facebook would be “grossly unprepared” for the 2020 elections.“Facebook wants you to think the problem is video-editing technology, but the real problem is Facebook’s refusal to stop the spread of disinformation,” said Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, in a tweet Tuesday.The video wasn’t technically a “deepfake,” which would mean it was completely fabricated, but still introduced Facebook to the kinds of misinformation it will face heading into the 2020 election.“We are strengthening our policy toward misleading manipulated videos that have been identified as deepfakes,” Vice President of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert wrote in the blog post. “While these videos are still rare on the internet, they present a significant challenge for our industry and society as their use increases.”Other U.S. internet giants are also tightening up on content ahead of the elections. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is restricting misinformation and banning deepfakes in ads following criticism that companies ran ads from U.S. President Donald Trump that were intentionally misleading. Facebook’s policy details were first reported by the Washington Post.How Deepfakes Make Disinformation More Real Than Ever: QuickTake(Updates with comment from Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff in fourth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Edwin Chan in Hong Kong at echan273@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergStudents Step Up Protests Against Thailand’s Army-Backed PremierBloombergCitigroup, Goldman, JPMorgan Slash Earnings Estimates for StocksBloombergBaidu Becomes Latest Tech Giant to Deliver Disappointing OutlookBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
