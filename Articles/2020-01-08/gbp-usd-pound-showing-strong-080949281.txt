Currently, the pair is trading at 1.3147, down 0.19% on the day.Which Direction for the Pound?The pound ended 2019 on a winning note, as GBP/USD chalked up gains of over 1.0% on the final day of the year. The pound reversed direction on Friday, the first trading day of 2020, but recovered these losses on Monday. So where is the pound headed? The U.S. airstrike which killed an Iranian general has roiled the markets, so we could see further volatility in the currency markets this week. Traders should exercise caution while the markets remain unsettled.British Services Sector StabilizesBusiness activity in the U.K. was stronger than expected in December. Services PMI improved to 50.0, up from 49.3 a month earlier. This figure beat the estimate of 49.1 pts. The 50-level separates contraction from expansion, so a reading of 50.0 indicates no change in services activity in December. Other key sectors of the economy remain in decline. Last week, Final Manufacturing PMI, slowed to 47.5, down from 48.9 a month earlier. The PMI has not pointed to expansion since April, as the manufacturing sector remains in decline. There was no relief from Construction PMI, which slipped from 45.3 to 44.4, shy of the estimate of 45.8 pts.Technical AnalysisGBP/USD continues to test resistance at 1.3150. Above, we find resistance at the 1.32 line. On the downside, 1.3050 has some breathing room in support, after GBP/USD posted strong gains on Monday.
