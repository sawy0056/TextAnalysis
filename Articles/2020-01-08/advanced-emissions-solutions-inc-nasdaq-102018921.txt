View our latest analysis for Advanced Emissions Solutions How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Advanced Emissions Solutions:P/E of 6.28 = $11.35 ÷ $1.81 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.How Does Advanced Emissions Solutions's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Advanced Emissions Solutions has a lower P/E than the average (20.8) P/E for companies in the chemicals industry.NasdaqGM:ADES Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreAdvanced Emissions Solutions's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Advanced Emissions Solutions's earnings per share grew by -3.7% in the last twelve months. And its annual EPS growth rate over 3 years is 28%.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Advanced Emissions Solutions's Balance SheetNet debt totals 14% of Advanced Emissions Solutions's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Verdict On Advanced Emissions Solutions's P/E RatioAdvanced Emissions Solutions trades on a P/E ratio of 6.3, which is below the US market average of 18.8. EPS grew over the last twelve months, and debt levels are quite reasonable. If growth is sustainable over the long term, then the current P/E ratio may be a sign of good value.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
