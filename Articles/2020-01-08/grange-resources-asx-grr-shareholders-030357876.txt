But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Grange Resources Limited (ASX:GRR) stock is up an impressive 108% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 14% in about a quarter. View our latest analysis for Grange Resources To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the last half decade, Grange Resources became profitable. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:GRR Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreDive deeper into Grange Resources's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Grange Resources's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Grange Resources's TSR for the last 5 years was 192%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Grange Resources has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 32% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 24%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
