Most of the time, cash dividends return more than what can be earned from deposits in savings accounts.Therefore, while selecting dividend stocks, investors generally focus on dividend yield (annual dividend per share/stock’s price per share) as this reflects the percentage return on the invested amount. Higher the yield, higher the chances of selecting that stock.Nonetheless, as dividend yield is based on the stock’s price, lower share price indicates higher yield, making the stock attractive. So, before buying such a stock, one must ensure that it is not a dividend trap. Decline in the company’s stock price may be on account of certain fundamental weaknesses, and if those persist, there is a high chance of further dip in price.Also, one must take into account the company’s debt levels. With significantly high level of global corporate debt, dividends might fall if corporates begin to conserve cash to service debt.Further, continued uncertainty related to the U.S.-China trade conflict, expectations of global economic slowdown and several other geopolitical matters could lead companies to conserve cash. This, in turn, might result in the firms maintaining the current dividend levels or even slashing it.Choosing High Yield Dividend StocksIt’s not wise to pick stocks just based on high dividend yield.
