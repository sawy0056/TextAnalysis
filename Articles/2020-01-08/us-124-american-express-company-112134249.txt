As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine American Express’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for American Express Is American Express still cheap?Good news, investors! American Express is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $166.94, but it is currently trading at US$124 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, American Express’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from American Express?NYSE:AXP Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.
