Essentially we have got everything in place — strong liquidity, strong momentum but valuations are high.”You best believe those stock valuations are high, if not excessive and undeserving in light of what looks to be at best 2% U.S. GDP growth this year (among other concerns).For instance, the “Warren Buffett Indicator” — which measures the total market cap of U.S. stocks versus U.S. GDP is at a record high of 153%. Before the Great Recession hit right around 2007 (and before stocks crashed...), this closely watched ratio reached a high of 137%. And before the dot com crash in 1999, the ratio peaked at 146%.In other words, stocks may have gotten out in front of their skis in what could be a slow growth backdrop in 2019. Hence, stock prices could be poised to take a breather — if not a large breather.Specialists James Denaro, left, and Mario Picone work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Wednesday, May 29, 2019.

The readjustment in stock prices could be around the bend, one just has to show a bit more respect to current valuations.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
