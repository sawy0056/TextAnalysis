Unifying more than 60 of the world’s leading job boards in 138 countries, The Network is the world’s leading single point of contact for online recruitment. With this new partnership, employers in the United States can utilize Appcast and The Network to fulfill their global hiring needs.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate remains unchanged at 3.5 percent, and the number of job openings has edged up to 7.3 million in the U.S., forcing organizations to compete for qualified talent.

The Network brings global recruiting to the local level, ensuring that the nuances of different markets and cultures are considered as part of the overall hiring strategy."Pierre Antebi from The Network noted, “The synergies between Appcast and The Network are significant.
