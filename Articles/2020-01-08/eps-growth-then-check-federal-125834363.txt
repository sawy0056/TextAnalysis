But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Federal Signal (NYSE:FSS). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing.
