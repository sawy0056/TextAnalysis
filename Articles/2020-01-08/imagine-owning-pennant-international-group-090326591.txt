But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the Pennant International Group plc (LON:PEN) share price is down 29% in the last year. That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 19%. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 3.0% in the last three years. Check out our latest analysis for Pennant International Group Pennant International Group wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.In just one year Pennant International Group saw its revenue fall by 30%. That looks pretty grim, at a glance. Shareholders have seen the share price drop 29% in that time. That seems pretty reasonable given the lack of both profits and revenue growth. We think most holders must believe revenue growth will improve, or else costs will decline.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).AIM:PEN Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreBalance sheet strength is crucial.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Pennant International Group's TSR of was a loss of 29% for the year. That wasn't as bad as its share price return, because it has paid dividends.A Different PerspectivePennant International Group shareholders are down 29% for the year, but the market itself is up 19%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 1.0% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.
