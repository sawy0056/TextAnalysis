Smart security measures are placed around critical inventory, while simultaneously making it easier for staff members to get the supplies they need quickly. ZIMBIS automates the ordering process to the suppliers when items reach reorder levels. All of the benefits in the ZIMBIS Mini and LabPlus solutions are present, but with a new, higher capacity form factor with much more room for customization."Dental professionals have desperately needed inventory management automation for years, but there hasn't been a cost-effective solution that addressed the unique challenges they face," said Louis Visser, DDS, Vice President of ZIMBIS. "The small, high-value parts used by dentists and dental laboratories are difficult to store and effectively manage, which is why we now offer the ZIMBIS 1000 and its sister products. It's the highest density storage system available, perfect for dental labs, dental offices and oral surgery practices." ZIMBIS 1000 is available now through a simple monthly subscription.
