In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Tian Yuan Group Holdings:0.08 = CN¥28m ÷ (CN¥416m - CN¥65m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Tian Yuan Group Holdings has an ROCE of 8.0%.
