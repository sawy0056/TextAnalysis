And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the MLP SE (ETR:MLP) share price is up 53% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 17% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 25% in the last year , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for MLP In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, MLP achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.5% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 8.9% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).XTRA:MLP Past and Future Earnings, January 6th 2020MoreDive deeper into MLP's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of MLP's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, MLP's TSR for the last 5 years was 83%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that MLP shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
