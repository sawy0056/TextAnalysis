"It has the ability to develop, test, and deploy code to web apps almost instantaneously."Edge computing" involves processing data near the "edge" of a network. Rather than transmitting data back to a central location for analysis and utilization, it handles everything in edge devices, as close to the user as possible.As explained by Hewlett Packard, the real power of edge computing lies in the fact that it enables real-time data processing without latency. This is, the company explains, critical for IoT technology such as self-driving cars. But beyond the IoT, edge computing can significantly reduce internet bandwidth usage while also making web applications considerably more efficient.And therein lies its applications for SEO, said Cane. First is the ability to use edge computing to speed up server requests and handle certain resource-intensive website processes such as Javascript. This allows websites to be made richer and more complex without sacrificing functionality."It might be a fairly new and not particularly widespread technology at this point, but there's little doubt in my mind that edge SEO will eventually become pervasive," Cane said. "I would strongly advise webmasters, web developers, and businesses to begin experimenting with it now. Applications such as Spark, Sloth, and LogFlare are all excellent starting points." ####About SEOHost.net: Located in Orlando, Florida with locations all around the world, SEOHost.Net provides a wide range of services in both the U.S. and the E.U., including domain registration, SSL Hosting for SEO, and VPS, dedicated, and A Class IP hosting The company offers exceptional service with a strong service level agreement, multiple geographic locations, and free migration.
