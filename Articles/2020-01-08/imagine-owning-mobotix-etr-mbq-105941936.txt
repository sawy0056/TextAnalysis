But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Mobotix AG (ETR:MBQ) shareholders, since the share price is down 43% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 16%. Unhappily, the share price slid 1.2% in the last week. View our latest analysis for Mobotix Given that Mobotix only made minimal earnings in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue to gauge its business development. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.Over the last three years, Mobotix's revenue dropped 2.0% per year. That is not a good result. The annual decline of 17% per year in that period has clearly disappointed holders. That makes sense given the lack of either profits or revenue growth. Of course, sentiment could become too negative, and the company may actually be making progress to profitability.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).XTRA:MBQ Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how Mobotix has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling Mobotix stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?Investors should note that there's a difference between Mobotix's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Mobotix's TSR of was a loss of 43% for the 3 years. That wasn't as bad as its share price return, because it has paid dividends.A Different PerspectiveMobotix shareholders gained a total return of 6.1% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 5.4% endured over half a decade. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around.
