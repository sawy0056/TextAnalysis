But few have heard of Frans and Mien Wijnakker, who like Schindler, were recognized as Righteous Among the Nations. They were Christians who risked their lives to save at least two dozen Jews in southern Holland during World War II—even performing a miracle to get a baby safely born. Based in San Mateo, Calif., Marty Brounstein is a storyteller and author who has been crisscrossing the country for nine years to deliver more than 725 presentations about the Wijnakkers' extraordinary courage and compassion. They are the subject of his book Two Among the Righteous Few. At a time when acts of hate and intolerance are rearing their ugly heads in the U.S., audiences around the county have responded with great enthusiasm to this inspirational story and the positive messages it has for people's lives today. Among the most receptive of these audiences have been those in the Valley of the Sun. Thus, Brounstein returns to the Phoenix area for a ninth straight winter to touch more people with the Wijnakkers' special story. Brounstein also has a meaningful personal connection that adds to the inspirational value of this story which he reveals in his engaging storytelling presentations. SPOILER ALERT: For without the help of the Wijnakker couple that miracle baby would not be here today. She happens to be his wife, Leah Baars.Here is the lineup of the five public storytelling presentations in the Phoenix area for winter 2020:On Jan. 22, Brounstein will give the first of the presentations at Dobson High School at 7 p.m. at 1501 W.
