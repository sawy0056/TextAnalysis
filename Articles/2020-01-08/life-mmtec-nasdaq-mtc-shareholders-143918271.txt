Unfortunately, shareholders of Mmtec, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTC) have suffered share price declines over the last year. To wit the share price is down 64% in that time. We wouldn't rush to judgement on Mmtec because we don't have a long term history to look at. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 11% in the last three months. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report. Check out our latest analysis for Mmtec With just US$204,425 worth of revenue in twelve months, we don't think the market considers Mmtec to have proven its business plan. This state of affairs suggests that venture capitalists won't provide funds on attractive terms. So it seems that the investors focused more on what could be, than paying attention to the current revenues (or lack thereof). It seems likely some shareholders believe that Mmtec will significantly advance the business plan before too long.Companies that lack both meaningful revenue and profits are usually considered high risk. You should be aware that there is always a chance that this sort of company will need to issue more shares to raise money to continue pursuing its business plan. While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt. Some Mmtec investors have already had a taste of the bitterness stocks like this can leave in the mouth.When it last reported its balance sheet in June 2019, Mmtec had cash in excess of all liabilities of US$4.7m. While that's nothing to panic about, there is some possibility the company will raise more capital, especially if profits are not imminent. We'd venture that shareholders are concerned about the need for more capital, because the share price has dropped 64% in the last year .

There's no way to know its value easily. What if insiders are ditching the stock hand over fist? I'd like that just about as much as I like to drink milk and fruit juice mixed together. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.A Different PerspectiveWhile Mmtec shareholders are down 64% for the year, the market itself is up 29%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. With the stock down 11% over the last three months, the market doesn't seem to believe that the company has solved all its problems. Basically, most investors should be wary of buying into a poor-performing stock, unless the business itself has clearly improved.
