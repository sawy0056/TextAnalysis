"This special contest presents a unique opportunity to support high school art programs across the country, as well as rewarding the talented artists with more support to do what they love." Starting today through January 31st, high school art teachers and administrators can register their school on the Vans Custom Culture website to be one of 500 schools vying to win the grand prize. Vans has partnered with Yoobi, Americans for the Arts and Journeys, who will provide a box of basic art supplies to help students bring their ideas to life. The selected schools will then be prompted to design two blank pairs of shoes illustrating the themes of: "Local Flavor" and "Off the Wall." In addition to their shoes, schools will also submit an "Impact Document" to help Vans determine the top 50 participants. Then, it's up to each school to rally the public to vote on April 20th, to move on as one of the top five finalists. The grand prize-winning school will receive a surprise visit from Vans and its partners, Yoobi, Americans for the Arts and Journeys, for a lunch time celebration, filled with giveaways and a presentation of the $75,000 check."The variety of submissions we received in the past continues to reveal the pool of talented artists we have and the need for well-funded art education programs across the country," said Carly Gomez, VP Marketing of Vans the Americas.
