How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.With Shougang Fushan Resources Group yielding 9.8% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Shougang Fushan Resources Group for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis SEHK:639 Historical Dividend Yield, January 7th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Shougang Fushan Resources Group paid out 82% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Shougang Fushan Resources Group paid out 65% of its free cash flow last year, which is acceptable, but is starting to limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested into the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Shougang Fushan Resources Group's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Shougang Fushan Resources Group's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Shougang Fushan Resources Group has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was HK$0.20 in 2010, compared to HK$0.17 last year. This works out to be a decline of approximately 1.6% per year over that time. Shougang Fushan Resources Group's dividend hasn't shrunk linearly at 1.6% per annum, but the CAGR is a useful estimate of the historical rate of change.When a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Shougang Fushan Resources Group's earnings per share have been essentially flat over the past five years. Flat earnings per share are acceptable for a time, but over the long term, the purchasing power of the company's dividends could be eroded by inflation.Story continuesConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, we think Shougang Fushan Resources Group is paying out an acceptable percentage of its cashflow and profit. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and its dividend has been cut at least once in the past. In summary, Shougang Fushan Resources Group has a number of shortcomings that we'd find it hard to get past. Things could change, but we think there are a number of better ideas out there.Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive.
