Returns On Capital Employed Make The Cut?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 7, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we'll evaluate BAE Systems plc (LON:BA.) to determine whether it could have potential as an investment idea. Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for BAE Systems:0.094 = UK£1.6b ÷ (UK£25b - UK£8.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, BAE Systems has an ROCE of 9.4%.

Past Revenue and Net Income, January 7th 2020MoreIt is important to remember that ROCE shows past performance, and is not necessarily predictive. Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Are Current Liabilities, And How Do They Affect BAE Systems's ROCE?Current liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.BAE Systems has total assets of UK£25b and current liabilities of UK£8.3b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 33% of its total assets. With this level of current liabilities, BAE Systems's ROCE is boosted somewhat.The Bottom Line On BAE Systems's ROCEWhile its ROCE looks good, it's worth remembering that the current liabilities are making the business look better.
