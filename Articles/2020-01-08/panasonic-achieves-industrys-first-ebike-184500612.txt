The systems' battery packs and motors met the rigorous testing conducted by UL that encompassed mechanical, electrical and functional safety tests. "UL has a history of creating safety testing programs as new products come on the market," said UL's Vice President and General Manager for Consumer Technologies Ghislain Devouge. "UL is excited to be part of the growth in micro-mobility and e-bikes because it enables a fun alternative to traditional transportation, and also helps city planners reduce congestion and focus on creating sustainable, smart cities."The standard's criteria for certification was determined by Underwriters Laboratories Standard Technical Panel, of which Panasonic is a member, and is comprised of industry leaders and government officials who voted to adopt UL 2849 1st Edition in early 2020.
