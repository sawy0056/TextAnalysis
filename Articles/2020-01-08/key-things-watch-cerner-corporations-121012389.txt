Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.Some readers mightn't know much about Cerner's 1.0% dividend, as it has only been paying distributions for a year or so. During the year, the company also conducted a buyback equivalent to around 4.8% of its market capitalisation. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Cerner for its dividend - read on to learn more. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Cerner! NasdaqGS:CERN Historical Dividend Yield, January 7th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Cerner paid out 23% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. We'd say its dividends are thoroughly covered by earnings.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Cerner paid out 13% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservative and suggests the dividend is sustainable. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Cerner's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. With a payment history of less than 2 years, we think it's a bit too soon to think about living on the income from its dividend. Its most recent annual dividend was US$0.72 per share.We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.Dividend Growth PotentialExamining whether the dividend is affordable and stable is important. However, it's also important to assess if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Growing EPS can help maintain or increase the purchasing power of the dividend over the long run. Earnings have grown at around 6.3% a year for the past five years, which is better than seeing them shrink! A low payout ratio and strong historical earnings growth suggests Cerner has been effectively reinvesting in its business. We think this generally bodes well for its dividend prospects.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Firstly, we like that Cerner has low and conservative payout ratios. Unfortunately, earnings growth has also been mediocre, and we think it has not been paying dividends long enough to demonstrate resilience across economic cycles. Cerner has a number of positive attributes, but it falls slightly short of our (admittedly high) standards. Were there evidence of a strong moat or an attractive valuation, it could still be well worth a look.Story continuesEarnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
