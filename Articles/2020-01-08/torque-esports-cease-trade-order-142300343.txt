("Torque" or the "Company" (GAME.V) (MLLLF) announces that its shares on the TSX Venture Exchange will be halt traded on January 7, 2020 . The cease trade order ("CTO"), which was expected and was previously announced on December 31, 2019 , is solely a result of the delay in filing its audited annual financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2019 , the related management's discussion and analysis and certificates of its CEO and CFO (collectively, the "Required Filings") with Canadian securities regulators after its filing deadline.View photos(PRNewsfoto/Torque Esports Corp.)MoreThe Company requires additional time to complete certain valuation work in connection with the audit of the Company's 2019 financial statements. The Company and its advisors are working diligently to complete such valuation work and will provide updates as further information relating to the Required Filings becomes available. The Company intends to make the Required Filings in late January 2020 . The Company fully expects to receive an unqualified opinion on its financial statements. The delay is not as a result of any disagreements that the Company has with its audit firm but rather strictly due to the additional valuation work required. Further, all previously announced acquisitions by Torque are continuing to move towards closing as planned.In connection with this delay, the Ontario Securities Commission ("OSC") issued the CTO against the Company. The Company expects the CTO to affect trading in all securities of the Company by securityholders of the Company.  The CTO will remain in effect until such time as the Company has made the Required Filings. Once the Required Filings are made, such filings will constitute the Company's application to have the CTO revoked and the Company's common shares will resume trading shortly thereafter as normal.Until the Required Filings are filed, the Company intends to provide information in accordance with National Policy 12-203 Cease Trade Orders for Continuous Disclosure Defaults.About Torque Esports Torque Esports Corp.
