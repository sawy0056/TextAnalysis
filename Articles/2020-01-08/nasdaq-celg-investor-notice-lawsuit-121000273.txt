The plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to disclose that trials for GED-0301 suffered from fatal design defects, such that GED-0301 had failed to demonstrate meaningful clinical efficacy, and that, as a result, there was an undisclosed risk and high likelihood that Celgene would be unable to develop GED-0301 into a commercially viable treatment for Crohn's disease. In addition, defendants also failed to disclose that the growth of Otezla sales had dramatically slowed during Celgene's third fiscal quarter of 2017 and that the clinical and nonclinical pharmacology data in Celgene's new drug application ("NDA") for Ozanimod were insufficient to permit a complete review by the FDA, which resulted in the FDA issuing a refusal to file letter to Celgene regarding the NDA. As a result of these false statements and/or omissions, the price of Celgene stock was artificially inflated between September 12, 2016 and February 27, 2018 to over $145 per share.On December 10, 2018 an amended complaint was filed and on February 8, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
