The assassination of Iran’s military chief by the United States toward the end of last week was the reason for heightened tensions in the region.Utilities to be in High Demand in 2020The utilities sector put up a decent performance last year, gaining 26.4% throughout 2019. A primary reason behind the sector’s growth last year was the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict, which kept rattling the stock markets time to time, thus inducing volatility in the major indexes.Investors thus opted to invest their assets into utilities, which are considered safe havens because of the nature of their products and services. This is why the defensive sector witnesses steady demand irrespective of market irregularities.However, now the U.S.-China trade war is at bay, with Chinese delegates arriving in Washington on Jan 13 to sign the phase one trade deal between the two countries on Jan 15.But another threat has emerged. Qassem Soleimani, chief of Iranian military operations in Syria and Iraq, was killed in an airstrike authorized by President Donald Trump on Jan 3 in Baghdad. This puts the already hostile U.S.-Iran relations in a tough spot, as both countries exchanged heated words and actions over the course of the weekend.Tehran said that the country would no longer stand by its 2015 nuclear pact with global powers. Trump had pulled U.S. out of the nuclear deal in 2018. In addition, Trump reportedly threatened Iraq with harsh sanctions should the country follow through the resolution after its lawmakers voted to expel about 5,200 U.S. troops stationed in the country to help fight Islamic State extremists.Picking the Right Utilities FundKeeping the aforementioned developments in mind, one may note that geopolitical tensions have escalated recently. Therefore, it is rather imperative for fund investors to invest in utilities. However, choosing the right mutual funds for one’s portfolio can be a rather tedious task.Let us, therefore, take a look at two mutual funds that invest in the utilities sector and discuss which of these is best suited to your portfolio.
