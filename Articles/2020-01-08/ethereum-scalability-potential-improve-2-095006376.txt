According to StarkWare’s “measurements (not approximations, nor estimates),” Ethereum’s scalability has the potential to improve by 2,000 times over Ethereum Layer-1 after the Istanbul update.
Post-Istanbul Ethereum can handle 9,000 trades at 75 gas/trade as compared to 2,000 trades at 300 gas/trade, said StarkWare, adding that Istanbul has “certainly helped.”
Ethereum underwent the Istanbul update last month, in which six improvements were added to the network, including reducing the gas cost.
StarkWare is still developing its solution via a unique zero-knowledge proof technology called zk-STARKs, which will let Ethereum scale through a layer 2 solution. STARK technology helps improve two key problems of public blockchains - scalability and privacy.
StarkWare said it would launch its mainnet “soon,” which will then help projects, such as DeversiFi, to integrate its solution.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextA 101 Guide to Ethereum’s ProgPOW ControversyCoindeskBinance Throws Weight Behind Shyft Network in ‘Travel Rule’ Standards RaceCoindeskCan cryptocurrency become the UN money of the future?QuartzEOS, Ethereum and Ripple’s XRP – Daily Tech Analysis – 27/02/20FX EmpireEthereum community members submit dissenting ProgPoW petitionThe BlockBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
