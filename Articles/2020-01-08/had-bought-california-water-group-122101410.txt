See our latest analysis for California Water Service Group To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, California Water Service Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.5% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:CWT Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on California Water Service Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of California Water Service Group, it has a TSR of 133% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveCalifornia Water Service Group shareholders are up 14% for the year (even including dividends) . But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 18% per year for five years.
