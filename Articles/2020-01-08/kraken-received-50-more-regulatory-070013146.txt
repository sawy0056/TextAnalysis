Breaking down the U.S. numbers, the agency making the highest number of inquiries at California-based Kraken was the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with 116 requests. That was followed by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) with 73 and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) - the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with 65. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made 20 requests.Last year, Kraken said “many businesses choose to block US users” because the cost of handling government subpoenas is fast becoming a “barrier to entry” in the country.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
