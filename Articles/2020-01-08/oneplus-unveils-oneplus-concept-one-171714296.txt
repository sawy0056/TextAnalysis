And while that might seem like enough, the company went a step further, by covering the phone's three back cameras with special electrochromic glass.What's that exactly? It's glass that, when voltage is applied, can go from clear to opaque. It's normally installed on bullet trains and airliners, and, of course, the McLaren 720s, but it's never been put on a smartphone. Until now.To be clear, the internal components of the phone are exactly the same as those found in OnePlus’s existing 7T Pro 5G McLaren. So you’re not getting some incredible functionality out of this handset.The OnePlus Concept One was unveiled at CES. Photo: Daniel HowleyMoreIt seems unnecessary, especially since consumers seem more than happy showing off the fact that their phone has a boatload of cameras, letting everyone know they’ve got a high-end device like the iPhone 11 Pro Max (AAPL) and its three rear lenses.Then what's the point of using electrochromic glass on a smartphone? According to OnePlus, the glass helps hide the One Concept’s cameras, which might otherwise break up the phone’s high-speed design aesthetic.So how does the glass work? When not using the Concept One's camera, the glass stays opaque, ensuring you can't see the underlying lenses unless you tilt it at the right angle and look especially hard.Launch the camera app, though, and the glass instantly becomes clear, letting you take photos as you normally would. The electrochromic glass also serves a secondary purpose outside of looks: It can be used as neutral-density, or ND, filter for the phone's cameras.An ND filter allows photographers to capture images that would otherwise look overexposed — for instance, a shot of a ship on the ocean on a bright summer day. While the photo would normally look blown out, the ND filter can help reduce the overexposure of the photo, giving you a far more attractive image.So when can you get the OnePlus Concept One? The company isn't saying quite yet. The phone still needs a lot of testing and evaluation, not to mention durability testing for the glass and leather. Reviewers will be sure to look out for how well the gold on the side of the phone stands up to the test of time.More from Dan:California’s new data privacy law will change the internetWhy your debit card is the least secure way to pay for goodsWhat to expect from IPOs in 2020The 5 largest IPOs of the 2010sThe 5 worst performing IPOs of 2019Got a tip?
