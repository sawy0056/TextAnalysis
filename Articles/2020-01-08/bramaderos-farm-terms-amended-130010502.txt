(“Cornerstone” or “the Company”) (TSXV-CGP) (F-GWN) (B-GWN) (OTC-CTNXF) is pleased to announce that it has amended the terms of its farm-in arrangement with ASX listed Sunstone Metals Inc., to provide Cornerstone with a 12.5% interest carried by Sunstone through to the start of commercial production and repayable at Libor plus 2% out of 90% of Cornerstone’s share of earnings or dividends from the Bramaderos project.Cornerstone CEO, Brooke Macdonald, said:“This amendment is a win-win for Cornerstone and Sunstone, relieving Sunstone of fixed obligations to earn an additional interest above its current 51% interest, and relieving Cornerstone of the obligation to fund 49% of the current drilling and future work programs for  feasibility studies and construction or suffer dilution of its interest. We are a prospect generator following the farm-in/joint venture model, and funding expensive drilling would be inconsistent with that business model. We are confident that Sunstone will advance Bramaderos as quickly as it can, and if there is a significant discovery there we will be carried through feasibility and construction until the start of commercial production with our 12.5% carried interest repayable at a low interest rate from a portion of our share of earnings from the project.“Cornerstone and Sunstone remain very optimistic of the likelihood of a discovery at Bramaderos and our focus on porphyry gold-copper targets has delivered promising results from the Bramaderos Main and Limon targets. We still have other targets including Porotillo, Gangue, and Playas to drill test, and we are advancing our epithermal gold exploration targets in the western portion of the project.’’About BramaderosMeasuring 4,948 hectares, the Bramaderos project is located approximately 130km from the Loja provincial capital in southern Ecuador.
