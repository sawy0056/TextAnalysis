If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.A 2.7% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests Shangri-La Asia has some staying power. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Shangri-La Asia for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Shangri-La Asia! SEHK:69 Historical Dividend Yield, January 7th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Shangri-La Asia paid out 65% of its profit as dividends. A payout ratio above 50% generally implies a business is reaching maturity, although it is still possible to reinvest in the business or increase the dividend over time.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Shangri-La Asia paid out 68% of its free cash flow last year, which is acceptable, but is starting to limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested into the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Is Shangri-La Asia's Balance Sheet Risky?As Shangri-La Asia has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). Shangri-La Asia has net debt of 6.98 times its EBITDA, which implies meaningful risk if interest rates rise of earnings decline.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 1.76 times its interest expense, Shangri-La Asia's interest cover is starting to look a bit thin. Low interest cover and high debt can create problems right when the investor least needs them, and we're reluctant to rely on the dividend of companies with these traits.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Shangri-La Asia's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Shangri-La Asia has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.031 in 2010, compared to US$0.028 last year. Dividend payments have shrunk at a rate of less than 1% per annum over this time frame.Story continuesWhen a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. Shangri-La Asia's EPS have fallen by approximately 19% per year during the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective, as even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. First, we think Shangri-La Asia is paying out an acceptable percentage of its cashflow and profit. Earnings per share are down, and Shangri-La Asia's dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. Overall, Shangri-La Asia falls short in several key areas here. Unless the investor has strong grounds for an alternative conclusion, we find it hard to get interested in a dividend stock with these characteristics.Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from costs or inflation. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company.Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
