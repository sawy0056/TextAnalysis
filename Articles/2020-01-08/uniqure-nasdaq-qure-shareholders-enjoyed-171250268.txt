But when you hold the right stock for the right time period, the rewards can be truly huge. One such superstar is uniQure N.V. (NASDAQ:QURE), which saw its share price soar 1077% in three years. It's also good to see the share price up 74% over the last quarter.We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance! See our latest analysis for uniQure Because uniQure made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.In the last 3 years uniQure saw its revenue shrink by 41% per year. So it's pretty amazing to see the stock price has zoomed up 127% per year in that time. There can be no doubt this kind of decoupling of revenue growth and share price growth is unusual to see in loss making companies. So there is a serious possibility that some holders are counting their chickens before they hatch.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NasdaqGS:QURE Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreuniQure is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth.
