(LON:QRT) and reflect on its potential as an investment. Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Quarto Group:0.13 = US$13m ÷ (US$160m - US$60m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Quarto Group has an ROCE of 13%. See our latest analysis for Quarto Group Does Quarto Group Have A Good ROCE?ROCE is commonly used for comparing the performance of similar businesses. Using our data, we find that Quarto Group's ROCE is meaningfully better than the 7.8% average in the Media industry.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. If Quarto Group is cyclical, it could make sense to check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.Do Quarto Group's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Current liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Quarto Group has total assets of US$160m and current liabilities of US$60m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 37% of its total assets. With this level of current liabilities, Quarto Group's ROCE is boosted somewhat.Our Take On Quarto Group's ROCEQuarto Group's ROCE does look good, but the level of current liabilities also contribute to that.
