It said the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed in the U.S. with any stage of SCLC is estimated to be 6%.-- Reuters contributed to this report.Related ArticlesVolkswagen says Luca de Meo steps down as CEO of SeatVolkswagen seeks damages from Prevent in ongoing legal disputeEnergy, healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lowerReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
