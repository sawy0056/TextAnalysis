Though auto sales dipped 1.3% per Autodata, automakers hit the 17 million sales mark for the fifth straight year, buoyed by cheap credit, low unemployment and healthy consumer sentiment.The Detroit Big 3 automakers and many large foreign competitors reported slips of 3% or less in sales. Passenger car sales suffered a persistent downside with sales dropping 10% while truck sales inched up 2.6% and electric vehicles jumped 37%. Last year, 69% of new vehicles sold were trucks or SUVs (read: Most Loved and Hated ETFs of 2019).Of the six major American and Japanese automakers, Nissan Motor NSANY stood at the bottom of the table, registering a 9.9% decrease in sales last year followed by the declines of 3% for Ford Motor F, 2.3% for General Motors GM, 1.8% for Toyota Motor TM and 1.4% for Fiat Chrysler FCAU. Honda Motors HMC saw a modest 0.2% rise in sales.The auto industry seems stable this year with automakers planning to introduce more than 60 new or refreshed models according to LMC Automotive and J.D. Power. Both Cox Automotive and LMC Automotive/J.D. Power predict U.S. auto sales of 16.7 million for 2020 while Edmunds expects 17.1 million vehicles.A resilient economy and higher consumer confidence will continue to fuel auto demand this year. A strong labor market would also encourage consumers to buy more vehicles. A boost in the housing sales and lower lending rates will further drive demand for new vehicles. Additionally, the Fed signals toward lower interest rate for some more time to push more consumers to avail of loans while buying vehicles. The combination of these factors bodes well for the industry though a spike in gas prices and rising vehicle rates could pose some challenges (read: Top-Ranked ETFs, Stocks From Top Sector of the Last Decade).Moreover, the auto sector has a compelling valuation with a P/E ratio of 12.15, the lowest of all the 16 Zacks sectors.
