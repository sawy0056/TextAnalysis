She explains that, unlike other wearables, Apollo doesn't just track your body—it uses vibration to improve your recovery from stress. Originally developed by physicians and neuroscientists at the University of Pittsburgh, Apollo's gentle vibration waves signal safety to the body and improve HRV—all through the sense of touch.Since Apollo is worn on the wrist or ankle, the wearable required a material that withstands everyday products—such as lotions, perfumes and detergents—as well as drops and daily wear and tear. Makroblend® M525 PC+polyester blend from Covestro delivers the toughness and chemical resistance needed to create this durable yet lightweight device."Wearables have a long checklist of needs to meet, and it all starts with the right materials," said Doug Hamilton, global healthcare marketing leader, Covestro LLC.Zachary Williams, market development, Healthcare – Polycarbonates, Covestro LLC, added, "Makroblend® M525 PC+polyester blend meets two important requirements—toughness and chemical resistance—to help Apollo users find balance with a strong and lightweight device that remains unchanged when exposed to a variety of personal care products.""Apollo is about empowering people to take control of their health—that's why we chose Covestro as a partner," said John Maholtz, chief operating officer at Apollo Neuroscience. "Covestro's premier materials ensure that Apollo users experience a clean, comfortable and long-lasting product that is just as resilient as they are."The device works in tandem with an intuitive app which, according to Apollo, features a variety of programs that help users:Increase energy Improve focus Accelerate recovery Support meditation Deepen relaxation Promote sleepAttendees at the following shows will be able to experience first-hand how the Apollo device helps their body adapt to stress:CES, January 7-10 in Las Vegas, at the Covestro booth in the Smart Cities Marketplace (Westgate – 313) and the Apollo Neuroscience booth in the Eureka Park Marketplace (Sands, Hall G – 53145) MD&M West, February 11-13 in Anaheim, California, at the Covestro booth (#2221) Learn about what else Covestro has in store for CES: www.solutions.covestro.com/en/highlights/campaigns/ces-2020.About Covestro LLC:Covestro LLC is one of the leading producers of high-performance polymers in North America and is part of the global Covestro business, which is among the world's largest polymer companies with 2018 sales of EUR 14.6 billion.
