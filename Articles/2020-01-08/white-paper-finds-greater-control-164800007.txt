This time SISF has turned to self-insurance expert Jon Wroten to examine the differences from an employer's perspective between self-insurance and high-deductible programs.Wroten, past Chief of the Office of Self-Insurance Plans, lays out the business case for self-insurance versus high deductible policies. Beyond substantial cost savings available to self-insured employers, the paper delves deeper by detailing how the innovative, first-in-the-nation Alternative Security Program (ASP) enables employers to conserve cash flow and capital without impact on their balance sheet or creditworthiness. Beyond the broad fiscal benefits, Wroten points out that for many employers, the most compelling and significant decision factor may be the ability for self-insurers to design and control every aspect of their workers' compensation program to meet the needs of employees and the objectives of the business.Tim East, CASISF Board Chair & CEOMore"Many self-insured employers find the ability to design, control, and customize their workers' compensation program to their employees and the company's unique needs is the single most compelling reason for becoming self-insured. Better control, cost savings, and financial benefits make self-insurance a superior solution over high-deductible or traditional workers' compensation policies," said SISF Board Chair and CEO Tim East. "SISF supports California businesses by helping them lower their workers' compensation costs and by freeing business capital through SISF's innovative Alternative Security Program (ASP)."The full paper can be read on the SISF website: https://www.securityfund.org/self-insurance-your-best-bet .Self-insurance provides lower-cost, greater control, improved outcomes, and peace-of-mind.The California Self-Insurers' Security Fund (SISF) has been proudly serving its members for 35 years since its founding on July 6, 1984.
