This time, the day before he is announced to speak out freely for the first time, they issued an arrest warrant for his wife Carole Ghosn," a spokeswoman for Ghosn told Reuters in Beirut. "The issuance of this warrant is pathetic."Ghosn is expected to detail some of the claims he has made against Nissan since his arrest.Citing an interview with Ghosn, Fox Business reported that he said he has "actual evidence" and documents to show there was a Japanese government-backed coup to "take him out". He plans to identify those he believes responsible, the broadcaster said.In earlier court filings seen by Reuters and statements released by his lawyers, Ghosn says he was unseated to destroy any possibility of a merger between Nissan and Renault, accusing Nissan executives of colluding with prosecutors and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry officials.Ghosn's legal team also said prosecutors withheld evidence, citing concerns voiced by Nissan that it included sensitive information about operations and employees.Nissan said that despite Ghosn's flight from Japan the company still held him responsible for "serious misconduct"."The company will continue to take appropriate legal action to hold Ghosn accountable for the harm that his misconduct has caused to Nissan," the automaker said in a statement.Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, on Tuesday described Ghosn's escape to Beirut via Istanbul as "regrettable" and said Tokyo had asked Lebanon for help. "It's necessary to carefully consider the legal systems of both countries," he told a news conference.Lebanon does not normally extradite its citizens.Turkish-based MNG Jet, operator of the private planes Ghosn used to escape, said half of the $350,000 flight contract was paid from Dubai by a company called Al Nitaq Al Akhadar, which it did not know.MNG said last week it was not aware Ghosn used its jets and has blamed an employee it said falsified documents to transport him from Osaka to Beirut.(Reporting by Tim Kelly, Makiko Yamazaki, Chang-Ran Kim, Chris Gallagher, David Dolan, Junko Fujita and Sam Nussey in Tokyo, Samia Nakhoul and Eric Knecht in Beirut, and Jonathan Spicer in Istanbul; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Christopher Cushing and Giles Elgood)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergJapan scrambles for workarounds after Abe urges March school shutdown to stem coronavirusReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
