is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Koninklijke Brill:P/E of 17.36 = €20.50 ÷ €1.18 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each €1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Koninklijke Brill Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company.

Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.Koninklijke Brill saw earnings per share improve by -9.3% last year. But earnings per share are down 1.9% per year over the last five years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does Koninklijke Brill's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals just 8.6% of Koninklijke Brill's market cap.
