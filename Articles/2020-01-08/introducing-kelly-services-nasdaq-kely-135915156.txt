But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELY.A) share price is up 42% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year hasn't been great either, with the stock up just 4.1%. View our latest analysis for Kelly Services There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Kelly Services achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7.3% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:KELY.A Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Kelly Services, it has a TSR of 52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveKelly Services shareholders are up 5.4% for the year (even including dividends) . Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 8.7% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing.
