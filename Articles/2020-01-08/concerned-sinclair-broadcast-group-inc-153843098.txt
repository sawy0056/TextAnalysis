By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SBGI).Sinclair Broadcast Group has a ROE of 7.4%, based on the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each $1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made $0.07 in profit. See our latest analysis for Sinclair Broadcast Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Sinclair Broadcast Group:7.4% = US$226m ÷ US$3.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does Sinclair Broadcast Group Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Sinclair Broadcast Group has a lower ROE than the average (14%) in the Media industry classification.NasdaqGS:SBGI Past Revenue and Net Income, January 7th 2020MoreThat's not what we like to see. We prefer it when the ROE of a company is above the industry average, but it's not the be-all and end-all if it is lower. Nonetheless, it might be wise to check if insiders have been selling.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining Sinclair Broadcast Group's Debt And Its 7.4% Return On EquityWe think Sinclair Broadcast Group uses a lot of debt to boost returns, as it has a relatively high debt to equity ratio of 4.09. The combination of a fairly unimpressive ROE, despite taking on a lot of debt, suggests the business is of average quality at best.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
