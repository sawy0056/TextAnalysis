With a variety of new features, the Neo HiFi helps to transform the lives of wearers with the best sound fidelity in an Eargo product yet while offering increased personalization via the new Eargo mobile app.View photosDesigned for adults with mild-to-severe, high-frequency hearing loss, the Neo HiFi is the latest in Eargo's line of comfortable, innovative hearing loss solutions. The product's new features include increased bandwidth, improved feedback cancellation, and a sophisticated wind noise reduction algorithm for enhanced performance processing speech outdoors. All of these features combine for a more natural listening experience with a more full-bodied sound.Eargo Neo HiFi, the fourth generation hearing aid manufactured by Eargo since its commercialization in 2017, continues to represent improved audio performance, physical fit and/or comfort. "We have relentlessly pursued our mission to optimize the quality of life for people living with hearing loss and we continue to do that by removing the barriers that deter them from seeking solutions," said Christian Gormsen, CEO of Eargo. "With Neo HiFi, we set a new benchmark for our products' sound fidelity, providing our customers with easier access to the sounds of life the way they were meant to be heard."Additional features now available in Neo HiFi include new Flexi TetraPalms, an update to Eargo's patented Flexi Palm design, for improved comfort and a mobile companion app so people can quickly adjust the quality of sounds for specific listening environments such as restaurants or concerts. The mobile app, available on iOS at launch and expected on Android in late January, allows people using Neo HiFi to more quickly adjust treble/bass levels, activate or deactivate programs and share reports with Eargo's own licensed hearing professionals, who can further customize hearing programs.Holistic Solution to Hearing Health CrisisHearing loss is the third most common medical condition in the United States, affecting more than 42 million adults and we estimate approximately 45% of adults over 60. Despite significant individual and societal impact, Eargo estimates only 26% of this population owned a hearing aid. There are a number of reasons for this, but among the most prominent are social stigma, high cost, and a disempowering consumer experience that treats buyers like patients with limited autonomy. Eargo address these issues head-on by shipping more affordable, virtually invisible hearing aids like Neo HiFi which are conveniently sold directly to the consumer and supported by Eargo's licensed hearing professionals, and managed via the Eargo mobile app."Hearing loss can significantly impact a person's quality of life by making it more difficult to work or interact with family and friends, and has been linked to isolation and depression as well as cognitive decline," said Daniel Shen, founder and Chief Clinical & Science Officer of Eargo. "We knew we needed to change the way the world thinks about hearing loss in order to address this significant public health concern, and we've succeeded in that goal by obsessively iterating on our product to make the best hearing loss solution on the market."Story continuesEargo Neo HiFi Pricing & AvailabilityEargo Neo HiFi is available for purchase online at eargo.com or by phone at 1-800-61-EARGO for an introductory price of $2,650 with financing available for as low as $123/month.
