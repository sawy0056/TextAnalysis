Videos that don't meet those standards are still eligible for review by the tech giant's independent fact-checkers.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX BUSINESS APPFacebook will partner with academia, government and industry experts, as well as more than 50 other global experts, to identify and take down these manipulated videos.The social media giant in September launched its Deep Fake Detection Challenge -- a project with $10 million in grants and support from the Partnership on AI, Cornell Tech, the University of California Berkeley, MIT, WITNESS, Microsoft, the BBC and AWS, among others -- to inspire a global effort to identify deepfake videos.Additionally, Facebook partnered with Reuters "to help newsrooms worldwide to identify deepfakes and manipulated media through a free online training course."CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSRelated ArticlesUS, France seek compromise to avoid digital tax on tech giantsWhite House proposes guidelines for regulating the use of AIIvanka Trump to talk America's future workforce at Consumer Electronics ShowReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFacebook Cancels Annual Conference Due to Coronavirus Concerns: 'This Was a Tough Call to Make'PeopleGrandfather, Navy vet among 5 victims of Wisconsin shootingAssociated Press‘Corona beer virus’ and ‘beer coronavirus’ searches increase as fears of outbreak spreadUSA TODAYDocuSign is acquiring this Bay Area company for $188 millionAmerican City Business JournalsThe man behind a satirical Facebook account promoting fake news has a message: 'Do not believe everything that you read online'Yahoo LifestyleBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
