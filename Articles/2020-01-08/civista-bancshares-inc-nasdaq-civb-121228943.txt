To keep it practical, we'll show how Civista Bancshares, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CIVB) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Civista Bancshares has a P/E ratio of 10.95. That means that at current prices, buyers pay $10.95 for every $1 in trailing yearly profits. See our latest analysis for Civista Bancshares How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Civista Bancshares:P/E of 10.95 = $23.13 ÷ $2.11 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does Civista Bancshares Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Civista Bancshares has a lower P/E than the average (13.0) in the banks industry classification.NasdaqCM:CIVB Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreCivista Bancshares's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Civista Bancshares's 138% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. The cherry on top is that the five year growth rate was an impressive 20% per year. So I'd be surprised if the P/E ratio was not above average.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Civista Bancshares's Balance SheetCivista Bancshares's net debt is 66% of its market cap. This is a reasonably significant level of debt -- all else being equal you'd expect a much lower P/E than if it had net cash.The Bottom Line On Civista Bancshares's P/E RatioCivista Bancshares has a P/E of 10.9. That's below the average in the US market, which is 18.8. The company may have significant debt, but EPS growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.Story continuesBut note: Civista Bancshares may not be the best stock to buy.
