Xiaomi Corp has launched three models, and CEO Lei Jun said last year the company would aim to unveil at least 10 models in 2020.Apple Inc, which has seen sales in China struggle since their peak in 2015, is expected to release a 5G device later this year.The 5G smartphone wave comes as China rapidly upgrades its telecommunication infrastructure to include 5G base stations. As of late November, China had 113,000 base stations in service, according to state media reports.This has given Chinese smartphone brands an incentive to boost sales domestically. Overall Chinese phone sales dropped 4.5% annually in October 2019, according to government data.Chase Qi, president of global marketing at Realme, said that he expects many consumers will upgrade their phones as 5G networks improve.He also said the company will focus on selling in Europe and the Middle East this year.Realme originated as a sub-brand under Oppo, one of China's top smartphone brands, before spinning off as an independent division. Both companies, along with Vivo, and Oppo, are owned by BBK Electronics Corporation, a decades-old device maker.The brand grew shipments in India nearly four-fold between Q3 2018 and Q3 2019, according to data from research firm IDC.Will Wong, who tracks China's smartphone sector of IDC, attributes the Realme's success in India to its affiliation with Oppo, which is known to give retail partners higher margins on device sales than competitors.He adds that while China is a new market for the brand, it will steadily become a priority as 70% of the market is still low-end to mid-range.($1 = 6.9473 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Josh Horwitz, editing by Louise Heavens)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergGlobal coronavirus cases rise as China’s downward trend continuesPA Media: World NewsChina's February factory PMI seen at lowest since 2009 as coronavirus slams production: Reuters pollReutersFed seen cutting rates amid virus threat, low inflationReutersBaidu Becomes Latest Tech Giant to Deliver Disappointing OutlookBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
