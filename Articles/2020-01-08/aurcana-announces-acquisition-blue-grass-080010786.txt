(“OSMI”) and Caldera Mineral Resources (“Caldera”) to swap certain mineral properties in the Mt. Sneffels Mining District located in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado.  The transaction is non-cash, accretive to both companies, and is expected to close in the first quarter subject to customary closing conditions.Under the terms set forth in the agreement:OSMI will receive 100% surface and mineral ownership of the Blue Grass claim located contiguous to current underground workings.  In aggregate, the Blue Grass acquisition provides OSMI access to over 7,500 feet (2,286 meters) of additional high grade vein that is contiguous to the existing 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) of vein containing approximately 15 million M&I silver ounces (80% of OSMI’s current 43-101 compliant resource) @ an average silver grade of approximately 22 ounces/ton. The current Virginius M&I resource is contained in approximately 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) of contiguous strike length on the Monongahela, Virginius and Nada claims southeast of the Blue Grass.  The Blue Grass claim has approximately 1,500 feet (457 meters) of strike length of the high grade Virginius Vein mapped on surface.  In addition to the strike length contained in the Blue Grass, OSMI’s ownership of this important claim also provides access to on-vein development to over 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) of additional contiguous Virginius Vein strike length to the Northwest on claims already owned or controlled by OSMI.Caldera will receive OSMI’s 62.08% surface and mineral ownership in the Hidden Treasure and Hidden Treasure mill site claims, 62.08% of only mineral ownership in the Good Luck and Good Luck Extension claims, and 80% interest in the Evelyn, Edward B, John R. and Vincent Claims located in Imogene Basin. These are non-core OSMI claims and are not part of or adjacent to the existing or contemplated future mineral resources, but for Caldera they are important as they control portal access to the Camp Bird 3 and Chicago level tunnels.The Blue Grass Claim is in an area that is accessible by road and can be drilled from surface. Aurcana intends to complete a surface drill program this coming summer and will announce the details of the program in the coming weeks. In addition, in conjunction with the ongoing work program for development of the 2000 and 1500 levels (see press release date November 11, 2019 and June 19, 2019) OSMI will evaluate additional on vein development drifting and sampling as appropriate.Management ChangeAurcana announces the retirement of Salvador Huerta, Chief Financial Officer.
