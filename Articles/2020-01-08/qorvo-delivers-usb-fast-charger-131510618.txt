Qorvo’s ACT4751M is the industry’s first AEC-Q100 qualified step-down, voltage-regulator IC dedicated to USB Type-C® Fast Charger applications.David Briggs, senior director of Qorvo’s Programmable Power Management business, said, “The proliferation of connected car devices with advanced in-cabin infotainment systems demands more power ports at higher power levels. Qorvo’s AEC-Q100 qualified power IC, ACT4751M, is a unique and easy-to-use step-down product that features the smallest size and highest efficiency on the market.”The ACT4751M meets all power requirements for USB Fast Charger applications, including the Power Delivery 3.0 Programmable Power Supply (USB PD 3.0 PPS) specification. Unlike competitive converter products, it integrates both the power and analog functions into a single power IC. This approach creates a complete USB Fast Charger solution when combined with a power delivery controller, reducing development time and BOM cost. The self-contained, step-down ACT4751M operates up to 40V and has protection features that withstand up to 48V of load-dump events in demanding automotive environments. A step-down charger provides protection between the power source and the device to mediate differences in the voltage source and the battery being charged. These chargers have become increasingly popular as more applications adopt USB Type-C® ports because they are universal and capable of delivering high power.AEC-Q100 is an industry standard specification established by the Automotive Electronics Council (AEC). In addition to its AEC-Q100 qualification, the ACT4751M meets the automotive EMI standard CISPR 25 Class 3 with patented DC-DC conversion technologies.Qorvo’s automotive power management product family supports faster design certification and shortens time to market by offering multiple reference designs certified for USB Fast Chargers and Qualcomm® Quick Charge 3.0™, Quick Charge 4™ and Quick Charge 4+™. These designs are fully optimized to minimize size while delivering maximum power conversion efficiency.The ACT4751M is available now for sampling; specifications below. Input Voltage 4.5 to 40V
Output Voltage 3.0 to 24V in 12.5mV step programming
Output Current 0 to 4A in 256 steps programming
