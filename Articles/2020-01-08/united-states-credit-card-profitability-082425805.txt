Still, margins began to slip between 2014 and 2017 as credit card issuers rebuilt their portfolios after the recession and normalized strategies in response to the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act). Return on Assets (ROA) for credit card banks fell from 4.94% to 3.37% during that period.The tides turned in 2018, when the ROA metric improved 42 basis points to 3.79%. Credit card issuers increased their lending margins and benefited by improved credit quality.The analysis presented in this research report illustrates which components affect the results, and describes why momentum should keep top credit card issuers profitable in the coming decade.Credit card issuers began to increase credit card interest margins in 2017 when the prime rate was 3.75%, and they continued to improve their margins in 2018. Indications are that the interest spread, or margin, will rise slightly into 2020. The momentum will likely continue through 2020 as almost 200 million cards were issued since 2017. The author also notes that the increased margin protects the credit card Return on Assets metric and helps shield against credit losses if the U.S. market should experience a downturn.Highlights of the research report include:An explanation of how credit card interest rates increased at a time when the prime rate has been lowA detailed explanation of the Return on Assets model in the credit card industryReasons why credit card profitability will be strong through the beginning of the new decade, and where risk existsA comparison of credit card ROA to all commercial bank ROASuggestions of ways for credit card issuers to protect their Return on AssetsA working model to compare any financial institution results to the Federal Reserve's Report to Congress on the Profitability of Credit Card Operations of Depository InstitutionsKey Topics CoveredExecutive SummaryROA Recovers from a Four-Year SlideCredit Card Report to Congress on Profitability:ROA Measures the Efficiency of Income and Expenses to AssetsNet Interest Income Shows the Cost and Result of Funding CreditNet Non-Interest Income Depicts Operational Revenue andComparing Net Revenue to Portfolio ValueThe Stars Aligned in 2018 and the ROA Metric ImprovedNet Interest Income Continued to Rise, and Non-Interest Income ReboundedRevolving Debt Generates the Interest IncomePortfolio Growth Is One Thing, Risk Management Is AnotherTry the Challenge: How Does Your ROA Compare?Gather InformationCompare the DataLook for OpportunitiesDevise a StrategyIllustrative Ideas to Improve Your MetricsProtect Net Interest RevenueIncrease Net Interest IncomeDecrease Net Interest ExpenseControl Net Non-Interest RevenueIncrease Net Non-Interest IncomeDecrease Net Non-Interest ExpenseConsider the ROA and Where Your Issuing Business StandsCompanies Mentioned
