Lucidworks and Cirrus10 have worked together as partners for the past two years and now combine their domain expertise to provide more targeted solutions for different domains in the fast-moving ecommerce market.Ecommerce companies face stiff competition to win sales and customer loyalty across all channels. Lucidworks’ AI-powered search produces relevant results, recommends products that meet customer goals, and predicts shopper intent to create a more engaging experience. Leading companies realize that powerful search is an effective way to boost their bottom line. In response, Lucidworks digital commerce base has been growing rapidly, particularly among the Fortune 1000.“As the experts in using search and AI to personalize user experiences, we want to be able to translate brand experiences to digital experience, which requires more subvertical knowledge. We realized that we could be doing even more for our customers,” says Will Hayes, Lucidworks CEO.“The objectives of each customer whether apparel, home goods, travel, or hospitality, are unique, and we want to become a partner in understanding the strategic imperatives of those goals,” Hayes adds. “Cirrus10 has been integral in moving beyond Lucidworks Fusion AI-powered search capabilities to understand and impact what brands are doing in the verticals they serve. By acquiring Cirrus10, we can go beyond technology to understand the distinct demands of these organizations and move objectives forward more effectively.”Cirrus10 was founded in 2010 by a team who shares decades of domain expertise working with search platforms including Solr, Fusion, and Endeca. The acquisition enhances Cirrus10’s impact on Fusion customers, and their expertise will drive Lucidworks’ roadmap, execution, and reach in the digital commerce field. They will help inform new product features to serve digital commerce customers while continuing to service their more than 100 existing implementations.“We felt an instant kinship with Lucidworks when we began our partnership in 2018,” says Peter Curran, Cirrus10 co-founder. “Fusion is the world’s only platform for extensible AI-driven search. Fusion elevated our service offerings by giving us a framework for exploring machine learning with our customers, and using it, we can build personalized and scalable relevancy models without a black box or army of data scientists. By combining Lucidworks search and AI expertise with our deep experience in the ecommerce space we can cement our role as digital commerce solution leaders.”The acquisition follows a record year for Lucidworks.
