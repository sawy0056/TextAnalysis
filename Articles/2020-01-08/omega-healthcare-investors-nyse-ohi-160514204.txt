View our latest analysis for Omega Healthcare Investors To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Omega Healthcare Investors achieved compound earnings per share growth of 1.0% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 9.1% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).NYSE:OHI Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreWe know that Omega Healthcare Investors has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Omega Healthcare Investors's TSR for the last 3 years was 65%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveOmega Healthcare Investors shareholders have received returns of 28% over twelve months (even including dividends) , which isn't far from the general market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 7.4% per year. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term.
