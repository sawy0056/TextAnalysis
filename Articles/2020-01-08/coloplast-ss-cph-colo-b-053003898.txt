Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Coloplast had pretty flat EPS growth in the last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 10.0% per year over the last five years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does Coloplast's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals just 0.2% of Coloplast's market cap.

Given the debt is only modest, and earnings are already moving in the right direction, it's not surprising that the market expects continued improvement.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
