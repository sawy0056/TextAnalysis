But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for Denny's Denny's's Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, Denny's has grown earnings per share (EPS) like young bamboo after rain; fast, and from a low base. So I don't think the percent growth rate is particularly meaningful. As a result, I'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Like a firecracker arcing through the night sky, Denny's's EPS shot from US$0.71 to US$1.81, over the last year. Year on year growth of 156% is certainly a sight to behold.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While Denny's may have maintained EBIT margins over the last year, revenue has fallen. And that does make me a little more cautious of the stock.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Denny's Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I like company leaders to have some skin in the game, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. So it is good to see that Denny's insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they hold US$40m worth of its stock. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 3.3% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Does Denny's Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Denny's's earnings per share growth have been levitating higher, like a mountain goat scaling the Alps. That EPS growth certainly has my attention, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke my interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So to my mind Denny's is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies.
