And, members who meet the criteria for following specific Part D vaccines are also eligible for rewards. To learn more about Optima Health and Medicare, please visit:  www.optimahealth.com/plans/medicare. The statements contained in this document are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of CMS.
