Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does Fastighets AB Balder's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals 97% of Fastighets AB Balder's market cap.
