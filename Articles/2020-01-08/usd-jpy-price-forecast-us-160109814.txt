At this point, if the market was to break out to the upside, it should send this market looking towards the 50 day EMA, and then eventually the ¥109.60 level. That is the area that continues to offer a lot of resistance and keeps this market from rallying significantly, so keep in mind that a breakthrough that level would be crucial to determining where we go next. In the meantime, expect a lot of choppiness as there are a lot of moving pieces out there that can drive risk appetite.USD/JPY Video 08.01.20Furthermore, this is a market that has a lot tied to the US/China trade situation, which seems to be getting better, but it is early days at this point. With that in mind I like the idea of waiting to see whether or not we get a daily close above the last couple of candles before buying, just as I would want to see a fresh, new low before selling. If we do get the breakdown, the market could go down to the ¥106.50 level, but that is probably going to be accompanied by bad news in general. With that being the case, it’s possible that it could be US/China related, or for that matter it could be something to do with the Americans and the Iranians. Either way, there are a lot of risks out there that could come into play.Please let us know what you think in the comments belowThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
