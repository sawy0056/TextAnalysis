The Saudi government's media office also did not immediately respond.The approved creditors' demands will now be included in restructuring proposals which the debtors and representatives of their respective lenders will submit to the court.The court approved claims from over 70 financial institutions in the AHAB case, including Saudi and regional banks, and international lenders such as BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and JPMorgan, the document showed.But it rejected two of four claims by The International Bank Corporation (TIBC), a Bahraini bank which has around $3 billion in claims against AHAB. The bank had raised money in international markets, transferring the funds to AHAB.Some $1.8 billion worth of TIBC claims were approved out of the $3 billion, according to the court document.A spokesman for the administrators of TIBC, whose default in 2009 was at the centre of Saudi Arabia's financial meltdown that year, said they planned to appeal against the court's rejection of two of its claims "as they represent claims that are no less worthy than the other two".(Reporting by Davide Barbuscia; Editing by Pravin Char)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergU.S. clamps down on troop travel in the Middle East due to coronavirusPoliticoWHO says virus at 'decisive point' as world battles spreadAFPPilgrims to Muslim Holy Sites Risk Spreading CoronavirusThe Wall Street JournalBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
