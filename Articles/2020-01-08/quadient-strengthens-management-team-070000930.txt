This function was previously occupied by Henri Dura who is retiring.After having reorganized the Group's operations by geographic area and having supervised them himself, Geoffrey Godet now entrusts to Jean-François Labadie, currently Chief Financial Officer with more than two decades of experience within the Group, the newly created function of Chief Operating Officer. Jean-François Labadie will be responsible for ensuring the proper execution of the strategic plan and the rationalization of operations on a local level, including the development of commercial and back-office synergies.Finally, Quadient appoints Christelle Villadary as CFO to replace Jean-François Labadie. Christelle Villadary spent most of her professional career with Technicolor (ex- Thomson Multimedia) (2002-2010) and then Suez (2010-2019) after starting her career with Arthur Andersen. Christelle Villadary will take office on February 1, 2020.Geoffrey Godet, Chief Executive Officer of Quadient, commented: “First of all, I would like to thank Henri for his long and precious contribution to the management of the Group under various responsibilities and in particular for having effectively organized in the last few months the centralized management of our portfolio of solutions. By setting up unified marketing teams and a unique R&D, by changing the identity of the Group in favor of a brand common to all of our activities, we have gained in cohesion and been able to put back the management of the needs of our 500,000 customers at the heart of our organization.I am also delighted to continue to rely, in a new role, on Jean-François and his perfect knowledge of the functioning of the Group's operations. We have recently moved from a holding company operating independent businesses to an integrated group. Jean-François will thus be able to continue to rationalize the organization of our operations within consolidated regions and locally create more commercial and back office synergies. This is essential to the success of our strategy.Finally, I am delighted to welcome Christelle, who will bring her new perspective, her competence, as well as her broad expertise in the financial function acquired through the various positions she has held in large international groups.The execution of our “Back to Growth” strategic plan is progressing in a satisfactory way, as evidenced by the fact that we have been growing organically in the last six quarters. We are continuing our efforts to grow our current operating income in the coming years and successfully transform Quadient.”Quadient is thus continuing the renewal of its management team undertaken notably with the implementation of the new organization in January 2019. While having promoted or added more specialized and more international profiles within its management team, Quadient benefits from new expertise and greater diversity. The arrival of Christelle Villadary follows in particular those of Jeff Crouse (Mail-Related solutions), Chris Hartigan (Customer Experience Management) and Brandon Batt (Transformation and Strategic Projects).BIOGRAPHIESGeoffrey Godet, aged 42, is a dual French and American citizen.
