How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Low Keng Huat (Singapore). We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Low Keng Huat (Singapore) for its dividend - read on to learn more. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis SGX:F1E Historical Dividend Yield, January 7th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 317% of Low Keng Huat (Singapore)'s profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Unfortunately, while Low Keng Huat (Singapore) pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.Is Low Keng Huat (Singapore)'s Balance Sheet Risky?As Low Keng Huat (Singapore)'s dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 69.70 times, Low Keng Huat (Singapore) is very highly levered. While this debt might be serviceable, we would still say it carries substantial risk for the investor who hopes to live on the dividend.We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 2.17 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Low Keng Huat (Singapore), and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well. High debt and weak interest cover are not a great combo, and we would be cautious of relying on this company's dividend while these metrics persist.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Low Keng Huat (Singapore)'s latest financial position,

Low Keng Huat (Singapore) has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. Its most recent annual dividend was S$0.015 per share, effectively flat on its first payment ten years ago.Story continuesIt's good to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth, anyway. We're not that enthused by this.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Low Keng Huat (Singapore)'s EPS have fallen by approximately 41% per year during the past five years. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and Low Keng Huat (Singapore)'s earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Low Keng Huat (Singapore)'s dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. It's a concern to see that the company paid out such a high percentage of its earnings and cashflow as dividends. Earnings per share are down, and Low Keng Huat (Singapore)'s dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. Using these criteria, Low Keng Huat (Singapore) looks quite suboptimal from a dividend investment perspective.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Low Keng Huat (Singapore) stock.
