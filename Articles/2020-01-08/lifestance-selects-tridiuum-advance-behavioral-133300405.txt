Both companies also view the relationship as a key driver toward their shared commitment to making suicide a "never event.""We are thrilled to support LifeStance in the essential work they do to treat mental health issues across the country – particularly as it relates to ending the suicide epidemic," said Mark Redlus, Tridiuum CEO.

Lester, CEO.
