The total surpasses the previous company record of 52,000 items collected last year and brings the number of food products and clothing donated over the program’s last five years to more than one quarter million.“We are grateful to LogistiCare’s employees for thinking of others this holiday season,” said John Roberts, Executive Director of Mountain Mission, Charleston, WV. “The people we serve are among the most vulnerable and the efforts of the company’s staff are vital to helping us feed and clothe families in the greatest need.”To help boost interest in the program and increase donations, LogistiCare’s operations center teams engage in a very friendly competition each year to determine which collects the largest number of items per employee during the Gobble Up Hunger campaign.Employees in Savannah, GA. (the “Savannah Sisters”) won the title by collecting 122 food and clothing items per employee. They were followed by the Charleston, WV. team (the “Charleston Champions”); 73 items per employee donated, and Norton, VA. employees (the “IncrEDIBLES); 60 items collected per employee. Norton’s team were the two-time defending champions and, no doubt, will be looking to reclaim their crown in 2020 amid increasing stiff competition.“I couldn’t be more proud to work with people that are truly caring and selfless,” said Daniel Greenleaf, chief executive officer. “This effort and other community outreach programs in which they volunteer throughout the year are extensions of the work they do every day in providing vital non-emergency medical transportation services to millions across the country. Their compassion for the less fortunate shows through in everything they do both personally and professionally, and I am deeply appreciative.”In addition to the collection competition, company teams also engaged in a contest to see which could come up with the most creative design for office collection boxes. Bragging rights for that honor went to the “Okie Duds and Grub” team in Oklahoma City, OK. Their winning entry included a train of collection boxes known as the “Chew Chew Express,” and another collection bin featuring a Cat in the Hat motif.For more information about LogistiCare’s community involvement, visit www.logisticare.com/community-commitment/.
