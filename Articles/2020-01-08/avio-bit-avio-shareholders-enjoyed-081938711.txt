But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, Avio S.p.A. (BIT:AVIO) shareholders have seen the share price rise 30% over three years, well in excess of the market return (6.3%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 25% in the last year , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for Avio To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Avio achieved compound earnings per share growth of 280% per year. The average annual share price increase of 9.0% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).BIT:AVIO Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how Avio has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Avio, it has a TSR of 990% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveAvio shareholders have gained 25% over twelve months (even including dividends) . This isn't far from the market return of 23%. Notably, the longer term shareholders are better off with their TSR of 122% per year over the last three years. Share price gains are anything but steady, so it's a positive to see that the longer term returns are reasonable. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Avio's dividend track record. This free interactive graph is a great place to start.Of course Avio may not be the best stock to buy.
