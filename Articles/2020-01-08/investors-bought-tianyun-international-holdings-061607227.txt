But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, Tianyun International Holdings Limited (HKG:6836) shareholders have seen the share price rise 27% over three years, well in excess of the market return (14%, not including dividends). View our latest analysis for Tianyun International Holdings To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Tianyun International Holdings achieved compound earnings per share growth of 7.4% per year. We note that the 8.3% yearly (average) share price gain isn't too far from the EPS growth rate. Coincidence? Probably not. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).SEHK:6836 Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Tianyun International Holdings's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Tianyun International Holdings's TSR for the last 3 years was 42%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveThe last twelve months weren't great for Tianyun International Holdings shares, which cost holders 10% , including dividends , while the market was up about 12%. Of course the long term matters more than the short term, and even great stocks will sometimes have a poor year. Fortunately the longer term story is brighter, with total returns averaging about 13% per year over three years. The recent sell-off could be an opportunity if the business remains sound, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long-term growth trend.
