According to Automotive News, domestic light vehicle sales totaled 17.1 million units in 2019. With that, automakers hit the goal of 17-million sales for the year. Notably, the 17-million sales mark was achieved for the fifth straight year. Importantly, 2000 and 2001 were the only years before 2015 when car sales touched 17 million units.Fed’s dovish stance, low unemployment rates and robust wage growth were tailwinds for the consumer-cyclic auto industry in 2019. Strong economic conditions and healthy consumer sentiments contributed to robust 17-million sales. However, it’s not all good news. While automakers managed to top 17 million unit sales, total sales volumes were shy by around 200,000 units from the 2018 level of 17.3 million.

RAM pickups posted the biggest year-over-year gain of 18%. Kia Telluride, the new midsize SUV, recorded strong sales. Mitsubishi’s Outlander registered the best salesfigure in the last 13 years.

Power, U.S. auto sales are likely to decline to around 16.7 million units in 2020.
