Likewise, the ecological system of commensal, symbiotic, and perhaps pathogenic microorganisms that reside within a host system is called the microbiome. Research insights, generated primarily from the Human Microbiome Project (2009) and other independent studies, have demonstrated that an imbalance in the microbiome (also known as dysbiosis) may lead to the development of several chronic clinical conditions, including Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diabetes, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Given the role of the microbiota in both disease development and pathogenesis, the concept of microbiome-based therapeutics has generated significant enthusiasm within the medical science community, defining a new frontier in the field of medicine. The growing popularity and interest in the therapeutic potential of the microbiome is evident across scientific literature; commonly cited terms in this context include microbiome, microflora, microbiota, fecal microbiota therapy (FMT), microbiome diagnostics, or human microbiome, as observed on the NCBI's PubMed portal, over the last three years.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05836971/?utm_source=PRN Over time, the efforts of industry stakeholders and clinical researchers in this domain have led to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies, including the establishment of a gut-brain axis, involving the human microbiome. Despite the evident increase in interest (of therapy developers and investors alike) in this field of research, there are currently no approved microbiome-based drugs / therapy products available in the market. However, there is a FMT in the market that is designed to modulate the microbial population within the gut for the treatment of recurrent CDIs. This treatment has been shown to be particularly beneficial to those who are non-responsive to standard-of-care therapies. In addition, a number of microbiome diagnostic tests are available for the detection of digestive and gastrointestinal disorders, inflammatory diseases and certain oncological indications. Further, several technology developers have started using next-generation sequencing techniques and other versatile bioinformatics tools for the characterization of important species of gut microflora. It is also worth mentioning that, in the last 4-5 years, there has been a marked rise in the number of new entrants in this field. Interestingly, several big pharma players have also become actively involved in this domain. Given the fact that there are several candidate therapies in late phases of clinical development, the microbiome-based medical products market can be expected to witness substantial growth over the coming decade.SCOPE OF THE REPORT'The Human Microbiome Market: Focus on Therapeutics (including gut-brain axis targeting drugs), Diagnostics and Fecal Microbiota Therapies (3rd Edition), 2019-2030' report features an extensive study of the current market landscape, offering an informed opinion on the likely adoption of microbiome-based medical products (including therapeutics, diagnostics and FMTs), over the next decade.
