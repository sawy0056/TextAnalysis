F.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Gain from a Growing Electronic Vehicle MarketThe electric vehicle (EV) market saw an uptrend in the past decade, with their owners managing impressive savings. After all, the cost involved in running an electric vehicle is much less compared to non-electric ones.What’s more, electric cars aren’t much under regulatory pressure and are environmentally-friendly as well. Moreover, improved batteries have doubled EV sales throughout 2019. Given such bullish developments, keeping an eye on some solid EV makers will be prudent this year.EV Market to Flourish in the Near TermSales of electronic vehicles had topped 1 million globally in 2017, followed by 2 million in 2018. According to a Deloitte report, EV sales are expected to cross 4 million by 2020 and may touch 21 million in 2030. Currently, EV and hybrids make up around 2% of the total automotive market according to both Deloitte and IHS Markit report. And Deloitte expects that growth in EV sales will lead to 10% market share gain by 2020.A major issue that is bothering governments across the globe is decarbonization in transportation, and stricter regulation and policies are being framed to combat climate change. In fact, recent discussions on the rollback of 2025 fuel-economy standards and Clean Air Act may lead to stricter regulatory policies that drive the sustainable market growth of EVs.On the consumer front, EV owners are enjoying the advantages of today’s electric vehicles. They are cost-effective, reliable, and have a much stronger battery and availability of sufficient charging facility. The fear of running out of charge before either reaching destination or a charging point is slowly diminishing. Per a McKinsey report, “battery costs have fallen about 80% since 2010” and are expected to drop by another 50% in coming years.Moreover, stricter emissions and fuel-economy targets are boosting the environmentally-friendly EV market.According to a AAA survey in May 2019, 16% of Americans were interested to buy EV as their next new or old car. And why not? With a low long-term cost, EV surely is ahead in the race.In a survey, Dan Workman, who owns a Chevrolet Bolt and drives 45 minutes up and down daily to his work place said that his car is “super cheap to drive” and “only maintenance” he did in the past two years was to “buy a $10 air filter.”Watch Out for These 4 EV MakersPresently, Americans are deeply concerned about rising fuel prices and growing climate crisis and EVs seems to be the best solution in hand. Automakers, thus, are working to tap the growing EV market.From stalwarts in the automobile space like General Motors, several smaller private players are aiming to launch multiple EV and hybrids in 2020. Mercedes aims to have at least an EV option for all of its vehicle models by 2022. In fact, Lunaz, the luxury car maker is also set to retrofit its classic models with 21st century conveniences like cruise control and regenerative braking to enter in the hybrid and EV car race.Let us look at some of the big players in the EV market.Tesla, Inc.designs, develops, manufactures and sells electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems across the globe.
