It often rallies during times of economic downturn and insecurity while falling during periods of economic growth.The precious metal is now 35% up since August 2018 and 25% up over the past 12 months.View photosThe next historic level of resistance for the price of gold is around $1,610, which was respected consistently throughout 2011 and 2013.Meanwhile, Bitcoin has also experienced a tremendous week of upside price action, rising from $6,800 to $8,000 in the past five days.The rise in popularity of traditional hedges like Bitcoin and gold demonstrates the fragile geopolitical landscape following the United States’ offensive move in the Middle East.View photosIran has vowed to “retaliate” to the attack, while US President Donald Trump has said an act of retaliation would only equate to a more severe attack on Iran itself.While the reality of any turbulent future warfare remains to be seen, it’s certain that the price of assets like Bitcoin, gold, and oil will undoubtedly rise in sync with the mounting tension.For more news, guides, and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.The post Gold hits seven-year high as tensions rise between the US and Iran appeared first on Coin Rivet.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergAt least 7 Iranian government officials have coronavirusThe WeekDonald Trump Must Know This: War Is No Alternative To Dealing With Iran (Still)The National InterestWorld prepares for coronavirus pandemic; global recession forecastReutersUS gives Iran sanctions waiver for humanitarian tradeThe IndependentBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
