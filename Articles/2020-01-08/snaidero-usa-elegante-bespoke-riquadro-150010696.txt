Mr. Snaidero has long wanted to add a product conceived and developed exclusively by Snaidero USA – yet still made in Italy, with the quality that comes with it - to meet the demands of luxury home furniture buyers in the Americas. “I am very proud of this award”, says Dario. “Our kitchen designs have won many GOOD DESIGN™ awards over the years but this is the first non-kitchen product to get this recognition and the very first product developed entirely by Snaidero USA, in our first ever collaboration with the talented Mario Mazzer Architects.”With RIQUADRO, interior designers, architects, and their clients can configure modern sideboards, highboards, and storage units that have at once a very light look and an undeniable architectural presence. Thanks to its high-quality finishes and wide range of modularities, the system gives the customer the freedom to design the units that will best suit their home, both functionally and aesthetically.Each unit includes a brushed anodized aluminum frame in one of three finishes, and doors and sides in durable, fracture-safe glass finishes with different degrees of transparency (accentuated by remote-controlled LED lights fitted on the internal shelves). The resulting effect helps RIQUADRO function both as elegant partition and connecting element between different areas of the home.To complete the aesthetic, the customer can select among a series of precious materials including marble, ceramic, lacquer, and nine exclusive woods (all CARB II compliant).  The chosen combination will determine the type of ambiance RIQUADRO creates.The height of the unit, its base, and number of shelves are all customizable within the range of available options. The units can also be complemented with a single or double drawer with versatile compartments.###About Snaidero USAFor decades, Snaidero USA has been the exclusive distributor of Snaidero’s Italian luxury kitchen cabinets in the Americas and today, it is the leader in North American imports of European kitchen cabinets.
