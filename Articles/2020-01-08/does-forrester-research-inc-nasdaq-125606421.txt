(NASDAQ:FORR) Share Price Fall With The Market?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 7, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosAnyone researching Forrester Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:FORR) might want to consider the historical volatility of the share price. Volatility is considered to be a measure of risk in modern finance theory. Investors may think of volatility as falling into two main categories. The first type is company specific volatility. Investors use diversification across uncorrelated stocks to reduce this kind of price volatility across the portfolio. The other type, which cannot be diversified away, is the volatility of the entire market. Every stock in the market is exposed to this volatility, which is linked to the fact that stocks prices are correlated in an efficient market.Some stocks see their prices move in concert with the market. Others tend towards stronger, gentler or unrelated price movements. Beta is a widely used metric to measure a stock's exposure to market risk (volatility). Before we go on, it's worth noting that Warren Buffett pointed out in his 2014 letter to shareholders that 'volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' Having said that, beta can still be rather useful. The first thing to understand about beta is that the beta of the overall market is one. A stock with a beta below one is either less volatile than the market, or more volatile but not corellated with the overall market. In comparison a stock with a beta of over one tends to be move in a similar direction to the market in the long term, but with greater changes in price. See our latest analysis for Forrester Research What does FORR's beta value mean to investors?Given that it has a beta of 0.80, we can surmise that the Forrester Research share price has not been strongly impacted by broader market volatility (over the last 5 years).

Beta is worth considering, but it's also important to consider whether Forrester Research is growing earnings and revenue.
