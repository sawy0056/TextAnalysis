For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But while the successes are well known, investors should not ignore the very many unprofitable companies that simply burn through all their cash and collapse.So should Arctic Minerals (STO:ARCT) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? In this article, we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow, which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves. View our latest analysis for Arctic Minerals Does Arctic Minerals Have A Long Cash Runway?A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. As at June 2019, Arctic Minerals had cash of kr3.2m and no debt. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through kr5.1m. Therefore, from June 2019 it had roughly 8 months of cash runway. To be frank, this kind of short runway puts us on edge, as it indicates the company must reduce its cash burn significantly, or else raise cash imminently. The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.OM:ARCT Historical Debt, January 7th 2020MoreHow Is Arctic Minerals's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?In our view, Arctic Minerals doesn't yet produce significant amounts of operating revenue, since it reported just kr2.7m in the last twelve months. As a result, we think it's a bit early to focus on the revenue growth, so we'll limit ourselves to looking at how the cash burn is changing over time. Over the last year its cash burn actually increased by 22%, which suggests that management are increasing investment in future growth, but not too quickly. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but investors should be mindful of the fact that will shorten the cash runway. Arctic Minerals makes us a little nervous due to its lack of substantial operating revenue. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.How Hard Would It Be For Arctic Minerals To Raise More Cash For Growth?Since its cash burn is moving in the wrong direction, Arctic Minerals shareholders may wish to think ahead to when the company may need to raise more cash. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.Arctic Minerals's cash burn of kr5.1m is about 6.5% of its kr78m market capitalisation. That's a low proportion, so we figure the company would be able to raise more cash to fund growth, with a little dilution, or even to simply borrow some money.How Risky Is Arctic Minerals's Cash Burn Situation?On this analysis of Arctic Minerals's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its cash runway has us a bit worried. Summing up, we think the Arctic Minerals's cash burn is a risk, based on the factors we mentioned in this article.
