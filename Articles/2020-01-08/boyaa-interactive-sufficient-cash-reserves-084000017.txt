These, together with the revenue of RMB246 million achieved during the nine months ended 30 September 2019, are sufficient to support the long-term growth of the company."E-sports Games+Going Overseas" Is Believed to Be a Strong Earnings Driver for Boyaa Interactive, as well as a Silver lining for the Gaming IndustryAccording to its Q3 2019 report, Boyaa Interactive recorded revenue of approximately RMB85 million during the third quarter of 2019, up by around 6.0% from the previous quarter and about 0.4% as compared to the same quarter of last year.According to Boyaa Interactive's interim results, its revenue in Q2 2019 grew by approximately 0.1% compared to Q1 2019. This shows that the earnings of the company are stabilizing and the impact of the policy risk factor on its revenue is under control.From an industry perspective, e-sports games are now in the spotlight. As shown in the Gaming Industry Report for H1 2019 released by GPC, China's e-sports market recorded sales revenue of RMB46.5 billion during H1 2019, up 11.3% year-on-year, with fast, stable growth over the past three years.Since 2015, Boyaa Poker Tournament ("BPT") events have been held in European and Asian cities such as Dublin, Macau, Sanya, Taipei and Ho Chi Minh City, attracting as many as 20 million players from more than 30 countries and regions.As shown in its Q3 2019 report, Boyaa Interactive is seeing fast growth in overseas revenue, which is far higher than domestic revenue.

Meanwhile, the increasing overseas revenue and a higher proportion of revenue from mobile games send a message to investors that the company has overcome the three major obstacles in its way.Where will the Card and Board Game Industry Be Headed after the Wild Growth? Affected by the policy risk factor, Boyaa Interactive witnessed declines in earnings starting from 2017.In 2018, the card and board game industry said goodbye to a period of wild growth. Gambling, the problem hidden amid the wild growth, loomed over the industry like the Sword of Damocles. After 2018, due to the enhanced supervision of the government, card and board games have been improving in quality and compliance with regulations.The number of active users of card and board games has been marginally affected over the years. Despite being elderly, they are loyal and have more money to spend. Therefore, there is huge potential on the card and board game market, waiting to be unlocked properly.It is believed that in the future, more card and board game firms will follow Boyaa Interactive on the path towards games of higher quality and compliance, as well as mind sports games as a way to improve players' experience and add more fun and diversity to the games.SOURCE Boyaa InteractiveReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIntercept (ICPT) Q4 Earnings Miss, Revenues Beat EstimatesZacksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceEl-Erian: The Fed will cut rates in March, if not beforeYahoo Finance Video'Stuck in no man’s land': A working mom details dealing with her sick child's student loan billYahoo FinanceAmid coronavirus, bitcoin has fallen 6% this week to below $8,800Yahoo FinanceMarket Watcher: Over six months we will see the markets higher Yahoo Finance VideoFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergMost face masks won’t protect you from the coronavirusYahoo FinanceStock market live updates: Dow drops 1190 points amid coronavirus fears, S&P 500 sees fastest correction in historyYahoo FinanceRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergCoronavirus-induced stock selloff means IPO market is 'on holiday': veteran IPO analystYahoo FinanceWhat to watch in the markets: Friday, February 28Yahoo Finance VideoOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergDon’t buy the stock dip yet, says Goldman as it warns coronavirus will wipe out earnings growth this yearMarketWatchStock market live updates: Stock futures climb after historic rout; coronavirus fears persistYahoo FinanceSomething 'dangerous' is happening beneath the surface of the market selloffYahoo Finance
