The API will release a report later this week showing that a fracking ban would put over 7 million jobs at risk by 2022 and cost the economy $7.1 trillion by 2030, Sommers said.U.S. emissions http://news.trust.org/item/20200107102718-xnfy5 of the gases that scientists blame for climate change, meanwhile, have been declining for about a decade, thanks mainly to the replacement of scores of old and inefficient coal-fired power plants with natural gas facilities.But the future of U.S. emissions has been cast into doubt as the Trump administration seeks to boost domestic fossil fuels development by rolling back Obama-era climate protections and other environmental regulations.While the oil industry has been a vocal supporter of the Trump administration's regulatory rollbacks, the API's ad campaign will cast the industry as an ally of Democrats and environmentalists seeking to cut emissions.“On issues that matter, like climate change, we are more alike than we think,” according to one of the ads https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87ObTFn68ic&feature=youtu.be.(Writing by Valerie Volcovici, Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Marguerita Choy)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextStephen Colbert, Trevor Noah Get Religion On The Coronavirus OutbreakDeadlineFed seen cutting rates amid virus threat, low inflationReutersIowa Recount Confirms Buttigieg Caucus Win: Campaign UpdateBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
