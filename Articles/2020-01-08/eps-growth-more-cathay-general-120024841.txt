Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Cathay General Bancorp (NASDAQ:CATY). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. See our latest analysis for Cathay General Bancorp How Fast Is Cathay General Bancorp Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS).

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Cathay General Bancorp Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It makes me feel more secure owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, thusly more closely aligning our interests. As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own Cathay General Bancorp shares worth a considerable sum. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$142m. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Cathay General Bancorp with market caps between US$2.0b and US$6.4b is about US$5.1m.The Cathay General Bancorp CEO received total compensation of just US$2.3m in the year to December 2018. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance, that arrangement seems generous to shareholders, and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Story continuesShould You Add Cathay General Bancorp To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Cathay General Bancorp has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. Each to their own, but I think all this makes Cathay General Bancorp look rather interesting indeed. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Cathay General Bancorp is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Although Cathay General Bancorp certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
