Green Dot's focus on attracting "high value" consumer banking customers came at the expense of so-called "low value" or "one-time use" customers, which are an important part of the Company's revenue stream. During the November 7, 2019, conference call following the release of its financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2019, the company's CEO admitted a continuing decline of active accounts which were mostly "one-time use accounts." Based on these facts, the Company's public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Green Dot, investors suffered damages.Join the case to recover your losses.The Schall Law Firm represents investors around the world and specializes in securities class action lawsuits and shareholder rights litigation.This press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some jurisdictions under the applicable law and rules of ethics.CONTACT:The Schall Law FirmBrian Schall, Esq.,www.schallfirm.comOffice: 310-301-3335Cell: 424-303-1964info@schallfirm.comSOURCE: The Schall Law FirmView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/572315/IMPORTANT-INVESTOR-ALERT-The-Schall-Law-Firm-Announces-the-Filing-of-a-Class-Action-Lawsuit-Against-Green-Dot-Corporation-and-Encourages-Investors-with-Losses-in-Excess-of-100000-to-Contact-the-FirmView photosReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHere's What Absolent Group AB (publ)'s (STO:ABSO) P/E Is Telling UsSimply Wall St.Investors ditch market risk as stocks fall into correctionReutersInvestors in Asia Still Betting Markets Will End Higher in 2020BloombergHow investors are using ‘alternative’ data to track China’s recovery from coronaviruMarketWatchBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
