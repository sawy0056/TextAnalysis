But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. To wit, the Polaris Media ASA (OB:POL) share price has flown 148% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 44% over the last quarter. View our latest analysis for Polaris Media There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over the last three years, Polaris Media failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 43% (annualized).So we doubt that the market is looking to EPS for its main judge of the company's value. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.We note that the dividend is higher than it was preciously, so that may have assisted the share price. Sometimes yield-chasing investors will flock to a company if they think the dividend can grow over time. On top of that, revenue grew at a rate of 6.4% per year, and it's likely investors interpret that as pointing to a brighter future.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).OB:POL Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Polaris Media's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Polaris Media, it has a TSR of 197% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Polaris Media shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 64% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 22% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
