But long term Graphex Mining Limited (ASX:GPX) shareholders have had a particularly rough ride in the last three year. Unfortunately, they have held through a 64% decline in the share price in that time. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 35% lower in that time. Even worse, it's down 18% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. Check out our latest analysis for Graphex Mining We don't think Graphex Mining's revenue of AU$3,731 is enough to establish significant demand. You have to wonder why venture capitalists aren't funding it. So it seems that the investors focused more on what could be, than paying attention to the current revenues (or lack thereof). It seems likely some shareholders believe that Graphex Mining will find or develop a valuable new mine before too long.We think companies that have neither significant revenues nor profits are pretty high risk. There is usually a significant chance that they will need more money for business development, putting them at the mercy of capital markets. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some such companies do very well over the long term, others become hyped up by promoters before eventually falling back down to earth, and going bankrupt (or being recapitalized). It certainly is a dangerous place to invest, as Graphex Mining investors might realise.Our data indicates that Graphex Mining had AU$5.2m more in total liabilities than it had cash, when it last reported in June 2019. That puts it in the highest risk category, according to our analysis. But with the share price diving 29% per year, over 3 years , it's probably fair to say that some shareholders no longer believe the company will succeed.

There's no way to know its value easily. Given that situation, would you be concerned if it turned out insiders were relentlessly selling stock? I would feel more nervous about the company if that were so. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.A Different PerspectiveThe last twelve months weren't great for Graphex Mining shares, which cost holders 35%, while the market was up about 25%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Shareholders have lost 29% per year over the last three years, so the share price drop has become steeper, over the last year; a potential symptom of as yet unsolved challenges. Although Warren Buffett famously said he likes to 'buy when there is blood on the streets', he also focusses on high quality stocks with solid prospects.
