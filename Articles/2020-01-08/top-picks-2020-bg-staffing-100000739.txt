And a trend is developing that will extend that growth, potentially forever.See also::
Top Picks 2020: Chewy (CHWY)You see, more and more businesses are turning to staffing companies to supply the talent they need to drive their businesses forward. And more and more employees are looking to contract work, too.Companies like the flexibility that temporary staff offers. They’re easy to hire and easy to fire. And when you’re not sure what the future holds, that’s a major benefit to hiring managers.We’re also getting close to full employment. And that makes it harder for companies to find top talent to fill their positions. And surprisingly, workers like the flexibility, too. They can often do the job from anywhere and work on their own time.There are over 20,000 staffing companies in the U.S. But there are only one or two that operate nationwide. Most are small mom-and-pop operations hoping to fill a need and make a little cash on the side. But it’s the big nation-wide ones that have the expertise and the deep talent pool major companies will be looking for.And that’s a big part of why I like BG Staffing so much. Staffing companies get hit harder than most at the onset of a recession. And the stock has been getting beaten down as if we’re already in one. But pretty much all other signs point to a continued economic expansion.That’s a disconnect. And it’s not going to last. BG Staffing can easily shoot back up to its all-time highs. And once it hits that level, its steadily growing revenues and best-in-class profit margins will keep shares climbing.Speaking of recessions, another strong point for BGSF is the type of employee the company provides.Not only does it help companies find laborers for light industrial work and technical employees for more skilled tasks (think IT and accounting), but it also helps fill the offices of apartment buildings and residential communities across the country.So, while other staffing stocks are getting crushed in a recession, BG Staffing has a segment that will be growing as demand for apartments tends to grow when the economy is bad. And it’s the company’s biggest revenue-generating segment. That means, while we would see a pretty big drop to start, BGSF will recover earlier and faster than nearly any other stock on the market.See also: Top Picks 2020: Shopify (SHOP)If I’m right and we’re not heading for recession in 2020, then you’ve got the potential for at least 30% to 40% growth. And let’s not forget that juicy (and well-covered) 6% dividend, too. This is definitely a stock you can buy and hold for a long time.(Editor's note: Jason Williams picked cannabis-focused REIT, Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) as his conservative top stock for 2019; the shares are up 70%. Jason explains, "IIPR started 2019 with 11 medical cannabis properties across the U.S. It’s ending the year with 42. I still love it a year later. I can see it doubling or perhaps even tripling in the coming year.")More From MoneyShow.com:Top Picks 2020: Corning (GLW)Top Picks 2020: AbbVie (ABBV)Top Picks 2020: ViacomCBS (VIAC)Top Picks 2020: Ladder Capital (LADR)Top Picks 2020: Franco-Nevada (FNV)Top Picks 2020: Qualcomm (QCOM)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceEl-Erian: The Fed will cut rates in March, if not beforeYahoo Finance Video'Stuck in no man’s land': A working mom details dealing with her sick child's student loan billYahoo FinanceAmid coronavirus, bitcoin has fallen 6% this week to below $8,800Yahoo FinanceMarket Watcher: Over six months we will see the markets higher Yahoo Finance VideoOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergMost face masks won’t protect you from the coronavirusYahoo FinanceStock market live updates: Dow drops 1190 points amid coronavirus fears, S&P 500 sees fastest correction in historyYahoo FinanceRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergCoronavirus-induced stock selloff means IPO market is 'on holiday': veteran IPO analystYahoo FinanceWhat to watch in the markets: Friday, February 28Yahoo Finance VideoFu Yu Corporation Limited Just Released Its Annual Earnings: Here's What Analysts ThinkSimply Wall St.Don’t buy the stock dip yet, says Goldman as it warns coronavirus will wipe out earnings growth this yearMarketWatchStock market live updates: Stock futures climb after historic rout; coronavirus fears persistYahoo FinanceSomething 'dangerous' is happening beneath the surface of the market selloffYahoo FinanceBeyond Meat beats on Q4 earnings, founder says 'we would be crazy not to invest in growth right now'Yahoo Finance
