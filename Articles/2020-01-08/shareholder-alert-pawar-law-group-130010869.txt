(BZUN) from March 6, 2019 through November 20, 2019, inclusive (the “Class Period”). The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for Baozun Inc. investors under the federal securities laws.To join the class action, go http://pawarlawgroup.com/cases/baozun-inc/ or call Vik Pawar, Esq. toll-free at 888-589-9804 or email info@pawarlawgroup.com for information on the class action.According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”), a Chinese-based multi-national technology company, was one of the Company’s largest brand partners, and paid more add-on fees for the work Baozun did for it, increasing the revenues Baozun received for Huawei work compared to the Company’s other brand partners; (2) as a result, Baozun reported outsized revenue growth during the first half of 2019, which would be abruptly cut off during the second half 2019, after Baozun restructured its relationship with Huawei, as Huawei took much of its online merchandizing in-house; and (3) as a result, Baozun’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.
