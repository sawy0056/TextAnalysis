HxDR creates accurate digital representations of the real world through the seamless combination of reality capture data from airborne, ground and mobile sensors. Users can then leverage the complete, accurate and precise replicas to visualise and share their 3D design projects and models within a real-world context.For the first time, airborne imagery and laser scans, indoor and outdoor terrestrial scan data and mobile mapping data can be seamlessly combined using HxDR. Users simply drag and drop their reality capture files into HxDR and the automated meshing function does the rest. Or, they can license real-world replicas from Hexagon's exclusive and growing 3.6 petabyte collection of towns, cities and landscapes.HxDR is specifically designed to help a myriad of professionals make more informed decisions. For instance, architects can share 3D building designs with project stakeholders within accurate digital replicas of real-world locations. Media and entertainment professionals can remotely scout production locations as well as leverage HxDR to streamline production workflows. City officials can leverage HxDR in their smart city platforms for urban planning and development."HxDR enables customers to create their own Smart Digital RealitiesTM, addressing the growing need for simple-to-create yet highly sophisticated and accurate visualisations of reality capture data that boost project efficiencies and cost savings," said Hexagon President and CEO Ola Rollén. "We're uniquely positioned to deliver this innovative platform due to the vast library of data captured from our world-leading sensor and visualisation services portfolio - a portfolio we continually enhance through R&D and strategic acquisitions such as Technodigit, Luciad, MyVR, and the newly-acquired Melown Technologies. Moving forward, we anticipate HxDR will play a critical role in the formation of smart city and smart nation platforms that will increasingly reflect the needs of citizens today and in the future."HxDR will be demonstrated at CES 2020, in Hexagon's pavilion CP-15.For further information, please contact:Maria Luthström, Head of Investor Relations, Hexagon AB, +46-8-601-26-27, ir@hexagon.comKristin Christensen, Chief Marketing Officer, Hexagon AB, +1-404-554-0972, media@hexagon.comThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/hexagon/r/hexagon-introduces-visualisation-platform-for-the-accurate-digital-representation-of-the-real-world,c3002173The following files are available for download: https://mb.cision.com/Main/387/3002173/1170455.pdf
