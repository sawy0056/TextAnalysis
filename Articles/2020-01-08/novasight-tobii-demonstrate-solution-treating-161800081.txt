The revolutionary solution combines advanced eye tracking and sophisticated artificial intelligence to treat amblyopia, a vision disorder commonly known as lazy eye, which is the leading cause of vision loss in children."One extraordinary aspect of Tobii's eye tracking technology is that it serves as an engine for innovation in healthcare and other kinds of specialized applications," said Henrik Eskilsson, CEO, Tobii Group. "Such is the case with the NovaSight CureSight solution we are demonstrating at CES, which represents an important new approach to treating a serious vision disorder that impacts many children and families."  While traditional vision assessments and treatments can be subjective and suboptimal, CureSight™ utilizes 3D image processing algorithms and Tobii eye tracking technology to blur the image only in the specific place where the patient's dominant eye is looking. This enables a natural approach to treatment that happens while patients watch their favorite movies and TV programs. The CureSight approach replaces the more traditional treatment of using an eye patch over the dominant eye, which can be less convenient and has lower compliance rates."There are 10 million amblyopia patients in the United States alone, and tens of millions worldwide," said Ran Yam, CEO, NovaSight. "NovaSight is focused on offering new and more convenient eye tracking based solutions for assessment and treatment. Our digital treatment is not only fun and engaging, but it can effectively improve vision from the comfort of a patient's home."NovaSight recently conducted clinical trials of the CureSight solution, which showed significant improvement in visual acuity in a cohort of twenty children that followed a twelve-week treatment program with a 95% compliance rate. The CureSight system, which is FDA registered, offers dozens of content sources including Netflix, Amazon, Disney, Cartoon Network, Fox, National Geographic and more.NovaSight will be exhibiting at CES on January 7-10 in Las Vegas at the Israel Pavilion, Level 1, Hall G, Sands Expo area.Tobii will be at CES demonstrating how eye tracking can create better devices and better user experiences.
