These places were cross-listed with available Zillow data on: (1) median home value and (2) median rent. The median rent data available on Zillow doesn’t exclusively include data from vacation rentals. Trulia and RentJungle were used for rent or home value data if that data was not available on Zillow. To determine the best place to own a vacation home, GOBankingRates calculated how many years it would take earning the median rent as income to pay off the value of the property by dividing the median home value by annual rental income. We also calculated the rental yield by doing the inverse, dividing annual rental income by median home value, with higher percentages being better.Data is accurate as of Feb 20th, 2019, and is subject to change.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Best Places in Every State to Get a Vacation HomeReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNew Strong Buy Stocks for February 27thZacksMortgage Rates Low 3% To End February 2020.
