Another spending spike as a result of the 1981 recession saw per person spending reach $7,557 in 1982.“Wars and recessions clearly affect government finances, but high levels of spending without those same external pressures raises legitimate questions about fiscal discipline in Ottawa,” said Jason Clemens, executive vice-president of the Fraser Institute.MEDIA CONTACT: Jake Fuss, Senior Policy AnalystFraser InstituteJason Clemens, Executive Vice-PresidentFraser InstituteTo arrange media interviews or for more information, please contact:Bryn Weese, Fraser Institute604-688-0221 ext. 589bryn.weese@fraserinstitute.orgFollow the Fraser Institute on Twitter  |  Like us on FacebookThe Fraser Institute is an independent Canadian public policy research and educational organization with offices in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax and ties to a global network of think-tanks in 87 countries.
