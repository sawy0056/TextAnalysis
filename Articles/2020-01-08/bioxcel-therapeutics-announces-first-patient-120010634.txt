We believe our candidate, BXCL501, with its unique mechanism and convenient oral dosing, has the potential to rapidly reduce agitation associated with dementia without excessive sedation or other undesired side effects. This study builds upon the foundation for a broad BXCL501 program in dementia, including the treatment of chronic agitation and the prevention of agitation using a wearable device in combination with BXCL501.”The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose Phase 1b/2 study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of BXCL501 in adults 65 years and older who exhibit acute agitation associated with all forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. The dementia program expands on the Phase 1b study performed with BXCL501 in 135 patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia, and also builds on the positive results observed in reducing agitation with intravenous Dex in Alzheimer’s disease patients. This is an adaptive design and is expected to assess multiple dose cohorts of BXCL501 or matching placebos. Following the completion of each dose cohort, a safety and tolerability review is expected to be performed to determine the next tested dose. The study is designed to assess agitation as measured by the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale, a validated clinical instrument, as well as improvement in the modified Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Excitatory Component (“PEC”).About BXCL501BXCL501 is a potential first-in-class, proprietary sublingual thin film of dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2a receptor agonist for the treatment of acute agitation. BTI believes that BXCL501 directly targets a causal agitation mechanism and the Company has observed anti-agitation effects in multiple clinical studies across multiple neuropsychiatric indications. BXCL501 has also been granted Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the acute treatment of agitation.A Phase 1b safety and efficacy study of BXCL501 yielded positive dose-response data. BXCL501 is being evaluated in the SERENITY program, consisting of two Phase 3 studies for the acute treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia (SERENITY I) and bipolar disorder (SERENITY II). BXCL501 is also being evaluated in a Phase 1b/2 trial for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia.About Agitation Associated with DementiaDementia is a neurocognitive condition caused by damage to brain cells that leads to a decline in cognitive abilities and independent function. It affects approximately 6 million individuals in the United States, with Alzheimer’s disease accounting for 60-70% of these cases. During the course of the disease, patients with dementia often suffer from psychological and behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, which has been reported in up to 70% of patients. Agitation associated with dementia can negatively affect both the patient and caregiver’s quality of life. Caregiver burden can contribute significantly to burnout, which can result in premature institutionalization of the patient. Treating agitation associated with dementia has been a challenge for providers and current standards of care often have a slow onset of action and/or cause excessive sedation. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of dementia-related agitation, and off-label therapies have black box warnings associated with their use.Story continuesAbout BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc.BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence to identify improved therapies in neuroscience and immuno-oncology.
