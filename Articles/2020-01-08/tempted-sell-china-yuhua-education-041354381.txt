We'll look at China YuHua Education Corporation Limited's (HKG:6169) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Based on the last twelve months, China YuHua Education's P/E ratio is 32.30. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 3.1%. See our latest analysis for China YuHua Education How Do You Calculate China YuHua Education's P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share (in the reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for China YuHua Education:P/E of 32.30 = HK$4.84 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, CNY ) ÷ HK$0.15 (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each HK$1 of company earnings. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does China YuHua Education Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (14.4) for companies in the consumer services industry is lower than China YuHua Education's P/E.SEHK:6169 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects China YuHua Education will outperform other companies in its industry. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.China YuHua Education shrunk earnings per share by 9.7% last year. But EPS is up 2.6% over the last 3 years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Is Debt Impacting China YuHua Education's P/E?China YuHua Education's net debt is 2.2% of its market cap. It would probably trade on a higher P/E ratio if it had a lot of cash, but I doubt it is having a big impact.The Verdict On China YuHua Education's P/E RatioChina YuHua Education's P/E is 32.3 which is way above average (10.7) in its market. With some debt but no EPS growth last year, the market has high expectations of future profits.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
