However it has been hit by sliding profits and sluggish activity among its wealthy clients over the past year, prompting questions from some investors and analysts over whether it needs to refresh its strategy.The changes announced on Tuesday mark the first big shakeup since the bank appointed Khan to lead its wealth management business alongside Tom Naratil in October, replacing former Commerzbank boss Martin Blessing as co-head.Khan and Naratil are also looking to boost collaboration with asset management and the investment bank to extend more complex financing to wealthy clients and increase access to private and capital markets.Similar strategies helped Khan turn around Credit Suisse's international wealth management business, more than doubling profits in the unit serving rich clients outside Switzerland and Asia-Pacific during his tenure from 2015 to June last year.FINANCING FOR RICH CLIENTSUBS wants to provide more financing to rich clients by taking on loans that are secured against riskier collateral - including single stocks, private equity and anticipated future cash flows - and managing the risks in the investment bank."We're giving them a broader variety of solutions which are available to our corporate and institutional clients through the investment bank," Naratil told Reuters. "And we're making them available for Global Wealth Management clients across the globe."In 2018, UBS set a goal to boost new loans for rich clients by a net $20-$30 billion a year. Loan volumes, however, have yet to pick up, and managers pointed to lingering risk aversion and complicated bureaucracy.The bank's EMEA wealth management business will be split into three regions, with Caroline Kuhnert appointed head of Central and Eastern Europe and Ali Janoudi head of the Middle East and Africa. Christl Novakovic, formerly responsible for the full EMEA region, will lead its main European business.UBS also said it was expanding its global family office group, aligning coverage of ultra high net worth clients to regional business units and enhancing its offering.(Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt; Additional reporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Louise Heavens and Pravin Char)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTraders Send Warning to Central Banks That Virus Pain Is No BlipBloombergEurope’s economy braces for coronavirus hit as market panic gripsYahoo Finance UKGain Capital (GCAP) Reports Q4 Loss, Tops Revenue EstimatesZacksGoogle searches for 'coronavirus' spike during Trump presser, raising concerns about the consumerYahoo FinanceBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
