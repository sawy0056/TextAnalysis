We'll look at Asia Tele-Net and Technology Corporation Limited's (HKG:679) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. What is Asia Tele-Net and Technology's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 5.52. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 18.1%. Check out our latest analysis for Asia Tele-Net and Technology How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Asia Tele-Net and Technology:P/E of 5.52 = HK$1.62 ÷ HK$0.29 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each HK$1 of company earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Asia Tele-Net and Technology Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Asia Tele-Net and Technology has a lower P/E than the average (11.3) P/E for companies in the machinery industry.SEHK:679 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Asia Tele-Net and Technology shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Asia Tele-Net and Technology shrunk earnings per share by 19% over the last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 69% per year over the last five years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Is Debt Impacting Asia Tele-Net and Technology's P/E?Asia Tele-Net and Technology has net cash of HK$164m. This is fairly high at 25% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Verdict On Asia Tele-Net and Technology's P/E RatioAsia Tele-Net and Technology trades on a P/E ratio of 5.5, which is below the HK market average of 10.7. The recent drop in earnings per share would make investors cautious, the relatively strong balance sheet will allow the company time to invest in growth. If it achieves that, then there's real potential that the low P/E could eventually indicate undervaluation.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
