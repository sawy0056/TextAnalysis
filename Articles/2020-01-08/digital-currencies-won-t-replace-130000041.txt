The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, previously suggested a central bank digital currency (CBDC) backed by a basket of reserve currencies – a “synthetic hegemonic currency” (SHC) – could benefit national economies as the process of globalization continues.But although SHCs could better rebalance global trade, they would have to be accepted globally, according to Gopinath. With many emerging markets, which are gradually making up more and more of global GDP, switching to the greenback, that is unlikely to happen anytime soon, she said.According to the IMF, the dollar made up more than 60 percent of global foreign exchange reserves in Q3 2019, having increased by more than $100 billion in the past year. The next largest, the euro, comprised only 20 percent of exchange reserves in the same period.In the past year, central banks have begun publicly talking about launching their own digital currencies. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) revealed in the summer it was “close” to launching its long-in-development digital yuan as an alternative to private initiatives like Libra, as well as raise the renminbi’s status overseas.Related: In Race for 2030 Currency Supremacy, the Dollar Is Its Own Worst EnemyFederal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said in November the U.S. central bank was exploring whether a digital dollar would even benefit the U.S. economy. The new chief of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, also recently said her institution should be “ahead of the curve” when it comes to CBDCs, though it needs to be clear on the objectives of a potential digital euro.The IMF has previously advocated research into digital currencies. When she was its head in 2016, Christine Lagarde said central bankers should “seriously” consider issuing CBDCs to encourage financial inclusion and improve the privacy of payments.But the IMF has also advised against premature adoption. In September 2018, it asked officials from the Marshall Islands to reconsider launching a digital currency that would work alongside the U.S. dollar. Unless the country introduced strict anti-money laundering checks, an IMF report said, it could face losing crucial correspondent banking relationships with U.S. banks, losing access to the dollar and effectively cutting the nation out of the global financial system.Related StoriesThe Bahamas Launches Digital Currency PilotA Decade of Quantitative Easing Has Paved the Way for the Age of Digital CurrencyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSteven Seagal settles with SEC over undisclosed bitcoin promotionsEngadgetChina's trade faces challenges as small firms battle coronavirus impactReutersCan cryptocurrency become the UN money of the future?QuartzBOJ's Amamiya calls for more scrutiny in issuing digital currencyReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
