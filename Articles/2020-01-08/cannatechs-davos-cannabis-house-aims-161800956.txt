From Latin America to Africa, many countries with great market potential are also home to disenfranchised populations. The global cannabis industry has the potential to protect local communities and stakeholders with impact investing.Global cooperation will be discussed in almost every Davos forum. With disparate global and domestic regulatory climates, the challenge of securing and de-risking cannabis investments will be another focal point for discussion. "Cannabis is on the verge of seriously impacting health care and the ways people partake in leisure activities. On the global level, the threat of climate change has opened people's eyes to hemp as a sustainable plant with innumerable uses for construction, industry, and medicine. These recent developments are creating new international ecosystems that will impact everyone from local farm workers in Africa to the world's largest corporations in the Western world. Davos could not be a better place to examine the place of Cannabis in the world at the beginning of this new decade," said Saul Kaye, founder and CEO of CannaTech and iCAN: Israel-Cannabis. Situated alongside world-leading industry and government pavilions, the Davos Cannabis House welcomes the Davos press corps to stop by and learn more. For more information about the Davos Cannabis House click here. About the Canadian Securities ExchangeThe Canadian Securities Exchange is a rapidly-growing stock exchange focused on working with entrepreneurs to access the public capital markets in Canada and internationally.
