Saskin will help drive Selligent’s growing CX business, working with its burgeoning channel and technology partner community to enable businesses to deliver powerful end-to-end customer experiences.“The growing expectations to deliver transformative experiences shows no signs of slowing. A new era of real-time personalization will take off in 2020 as delivering connected customer experiences becomes a requirement, not just a differentiator for businesses,” said John Hernandez, CEO of Selligent. “Matthew has seen this evolution first-hand with his years-long background as both a practitioner and leader in digital strategy and CX. I could not think of a more experienced leader to work closely with our partners to enable their customers to execute and influence the entire customer journey using the Selligent platform.”Saskin brings more than 15 years of CX and digital strategy experience to Selligent, most recently serving as VP and General Manager of Dimension Data’s Customer Experience practice for the Americas. While there, Saskin defined and executed against a multi-year growth plan, which led to substantial growth in professional, managed, and cloud services bookings. Prior to his role at Dimension Data, Matthew was global practice director at managed services provider, IPsoft, where he spearheaded its unified communications and contact center managed services practice, growing revenues from $0 to $20M ARR within two years.“I’ve always had a passion for using technology to deliver transformational business outcomes. I am very excited to join Selligent to usher in the next wave of experience-driven solutions,” said Saskin. “For years, organizations have struggled to break down silos across channels and functions to deliver end-to-end experiences – until now.  I look forward to working with the Selligent team to drive change across the industry with their game-changing platform, and witness its growing impact in helping organizations deliver high-quality experiences.”Saskin joins Selligent on the heels of its continued CX ecosystem growth. In early December 2019, the company announced that it has joined Cisco’s SolutionsPlus program, bringing experience-driven solutions to Cisco’s customer base.
