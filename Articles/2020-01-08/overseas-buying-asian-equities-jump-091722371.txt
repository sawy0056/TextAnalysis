Taiwan and Indonesia also drew foreign funds totalling about $6 billion and $3.5 billion respectively.DBS bank said that the Indian government's removal of tax surcharges on foreign portfolio investors and the outperformance of domestic equities helped fuel inflows last year.Thailand and Philippines, meantime, registered small outflows in 2019.Foreign buying of regional stocks totalled $2.92 billion in December. During the month China and United States agreed on a preliminary trade deal that is expected to be signed on Jan. 15.Goldman Sachs said foreign investors "net bought only half of the US$50bn peak-to-trough outflows of 2018 and cumulative FII flows are tracking more than US$40bn below the long-term trend, suggesting room to recover further."MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.4% so far this year, after securing 16.3% gains in 2019."Going into 2020 on a relatively good note for the outstanding issues from 2019 - including the U.S.-China trade (deal) -Asian equities are expected to continue seeing a steady foreign inflows," said IG's Pan."A modest recovery for most Asian economies is expected from 2019 that should keep the outlook positive for the region," Pan said.(Reporting by Gaurav Dogra and Patturaja Murugaboopathy in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextEuropean money transfer firm Azimo now uses XRP to settle select remittancesThe BlockMoney Sender Azimo to Use Ripple Tech and XRP for Philippines Remittance CorridorCoindeskManchester United vs Club Brugge: How to watch in Malaysia, Singapore & Philippines, TV channel, free live stream, kickoff time and squad newsGoal.comTebow excited to join Philippines in World Baseball ClassicAFPTebow will play for Philippines in World Baseball ClassicAssociated PressBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
