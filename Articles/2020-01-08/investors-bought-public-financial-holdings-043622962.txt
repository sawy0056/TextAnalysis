But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term Public Financial Holdings Limited (HKG:626) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 17% over a half decade. See our latest analysis for Public Financial Holdings While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Public Financial Holdings actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 7.2% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Generally speaking we'd expect to see stronger share price increases on the back of sustained EPS growth, but other metrics may hold a clue to why the share price performance is relatively modest.We note that the dividend has remained healthy, so that wouldn't really explain the share price drop. While it's not completely obvious why the share price is down, a closer look at the company's history might help explain it.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:626 Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreIf you are thinking of buying or selling Public Financial Holdings stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Public Financial Holdings's TSR for the last 5 years was 8.7%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectivePublic Financial Holdings shareholders gained a total return of 4.6% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 1.7% over half a decade It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals.
