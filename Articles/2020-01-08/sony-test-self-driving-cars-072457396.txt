The company has no plans to produce its own cars, he added.Sony dominates the market for smartphone image sensors, but has been trying to catch up with ON Semiconductor Corp in sensors for automotive applications."It's not an exaggeration to say that mobile has been the mega-trend of the last decade," Sony Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida said at a CES press conference. "I believe the next megatrend will be mobility."(Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
