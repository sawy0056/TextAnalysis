Alaska USA now leverages this platform to modernize and simplify their payments operating environment, while realizing a more efficient and cost-effective way to deliver innovative services to their members, now and in the future. In the early 2000s, Alaska USA began offering online account access to their members. As their digital banking offering evolved over the years, adding account-to-account transfers and bill pay features, Alaska USA remained committed to delivering an easy-to-navigate user experience. When the time came for Alaska USA to deliver next generation electronic money movement capabilities to their members, they chose The MoveMoney Platform, “which enables us to create a more cohesive digital money management experience for our members,” adds Bailey.“Our platform stands alone in the market today,” remarks Marcell King, Chief Innovation Officer, Payveris. “Our enterprise payments hub is the only scaled and proven alternative to the legacy digital payment providers’ disparate point solutions that are built on decades-old technology.”Converting off-legacy systems can be frightening and extremely stressful. “No one takes this decision lightly, and most organizations put it off as long as they can,” continues Bailey. “To our relief, Payveris delivered the smoothest conversion possible!”“We’ve completed over 150 conversions in the last few years. Achieving 100% data load accuracy with the Alaska USA conversion is a major success in our industry,” says Nate Dudek, Chief Technology Officer, Payveris. “It takes a closely aligned team of stakeholders from both sides, plus our intelligent conversion technology to achieve this level of success.”What’s next? “As our members’ money movement needs evolve, we’re going to be able to deliver more digital banking capabilities, thanks to the flexibility of The MoveMoney Platform and its open-API, cloud-based architecture. We have a very exciting future ahead of us,” says Bailey.About Payveris Payveris is the creator of The MoveMoney Platform, an Open API cloud-based platform enabling financial institutions to control, simplify, and extend digital money movement capabilities to any application or device while lowering user experience friction, significantly reducing operating costs & future-proofing the IT investment.
