We'll use ROE to examine Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF), by way of a worked example.Our data shows Cincinnati Financial has a return on equity of 9.8% for the last year. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each $1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made $0.10 in profit. View our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Cincinnati Financial:9.8% = US$919m ÷ US$9.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does Cincinnati Financial Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Cincinnati Financial has a similar ROE to the average in the Insurance industry classification (9.0%).NasdaqGS:CINF Past Revenue and Net Income, January 7th 2020MoreThat's not overly surprising. ROE can give us a view about company quality, but many investors also look to other factors, such as whether there are insiders buying shares. If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining Cincinnati Financial's Debt And Its 9.8% Return On EquityWhile Cincinnati Financial does have a tiny amount of debt, with debt to equity of just 0.088, we think the use of debt is very modest. The fact that it achieved a fairly good ROE with only modest debt suggests the business might be worth putting on your watchlist. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.
