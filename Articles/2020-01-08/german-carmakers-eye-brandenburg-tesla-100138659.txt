Steinbach said. "We are noticing a pull effect," Steinbach said about Tesla's decision.Microvast, a company specialized in fast charging and battery solutions, will build a factory in Ludwigsfelde and BASF <BASFn.DE> is mulling whether to build an electric car battery cell production facility in the region, Steinbach said.BASF's management board is due to decide in the next six to seven months whether to formally approve the investment, Steinbach said.Brandenburg's state capital Potsdam, home to a university, and the region's proximity to Berlin means companies can draw from a pool of academics. Tesla will have no problem finding talented assembly workers given that rivals Audi, VW and BMW are cutting costs, Steinbach added.(Reporting by Andreas Rinke and Edward Taylor; Editing by Michelle Martin)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
