"Motivated by this and by the vast potential for B2B applications, we created a hologram Virtual Personal Assistant combining the best features of both Smart Speakers and VPA's – what we call 'Q-Live'," said Safari.Safari, one of the original patent holders for the electronic cigarette, brought the hologram VPA to life in his skunk works in Seal Beach, CA.  After seeing the desktop personal companion by Gatebox Inc. of Japan, Safari developed an AI and hologram platform to expand the functionality of the Gatebox GTBX-100 for the U.S. market.  Working in conjunction with New Zealand's Umajin, Q-Live is a virtual concierge enabling the B2B market to provide improved, timely, personalized, "face-to-face" service throughout their entire customer base which would be too costly to do otherwise. The technology combines the latest advancements in AI, motion capture, facial and mood recognition and voice activation with sophisticated hologram imagery for a proprietary platform that generates the most lifelike effect. "This is why," Safari notes, "we say that Q-Live is so intelligent you will question the artificial."As a result, KIG is beginning implementations with major clients in the hospitality and retail industries that see the benefit of lowered response time and greater cost efficiency by using intelligent avatars to handle customer service requests. About Keyshare Innovation Group (KIG)KIG is a technology company with tentacles stretching throughout the supply chain from design and manufacturing to retail distribution – a new approach to supplying top of the line products and proprietary technological solutions from commercial drones to mapping and scanning equipment for the medical industry – where the company has a particular expertise in facial and body scanning.  KIG develops a multitude of innovative and high tech solutions to keep businesses ahead of the curve and maximize efficiency, performance and profit.About Gatebox Inc.Gatebox Inc., a subsidiary of Line Corporation manufactures a communication device for living with virtual characters - "Hikari Azuma," is an A.I. companion on sale now in Japan.Media Contact: Robert Safari, Keyshare innovation Group, 231890@email4pr.com, (818) 569-9552CisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/keyshare-innovation-group-introduces-hologram-virtual-personal-assistant-q-live-at-the-consumer-electronics-show-300982621.htmlSOURCE Keyshare Innovation GroupReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceEl-Erian: The Fed will cut rates in March, if not beforeYahoo Finance Video'Stuck in no man’s land': A working mom details dealing with her sick child's student loan billYahoo FinanceAmid coronavirus, bitcoin has fallen 6% this week to below $8,800Yahoo FinanceMarket Watcher: Over six months we will see the markets higher Yahoo Finance VideoOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergMost face masks won’t protect you from the coronavirusYahoo FinanceStock market live updates: Dow drops 1190 points amid coronavirus fears, S&P 500 sees fastest correction in historyYahoo FinanceRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergCoronavirus-induced stock selloff means IPO market is 'on holiday': veteran IPO analystYahoo FinanceWhat to watch in the markets: Friday, February 28Yahoo Finance VideoFu Yu Corporation Limited Just Released Its Annual Earnings: Here's What Analysts ThinkSimply Wall St.Don’t buy the stock dip yet, says Goldman as it warns coronavirus will wipe out earnings growth this yearMarketWatchStock market live updates: Stock futures climb after historic rout; coronavirus fears persistYahoo FinanceSomething 'dangerous' is happening beneath the surface of the market selloffYahoo FinanceBeyond Meat beats on Q4 earnings, founder says 'we would be crazy not to invest in growth right now'Yahoo Finance
