To keep it practical, we'll show how American Shipping Company ASA's (OB:AMSC) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. What is American Shipping's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 46.91. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 2.1%. View our latest analysis for American Shipping How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share (in the reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for American Shipping:P/E of 46.91 = NOK3.71 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, USD ) ÷ NOK0.08 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each NOK1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does American Shipping's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. As you can see below, American Shipping has a much higher P/E than the average company (12.2) in the shipping industry.OB:AMSC Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that American Shipping shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.American Shipping saw earnings per share decrease by 74% last year. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 30% per year over the last five years. This could justify a pessimistic P/E.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).American Shipping's Balance SheetNet debt totals a substantial 234% of American Shipping's market cap. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you must keep in mind that these debt levels would usually warrant a relatively low P/E.The Bottom Line On American Shipping's P/E RatioAmerican Shipping's P/E is 46.9 which is way above average (14.3) in its market. With meaningful debt and a lack of recent earnings growth, the market has high expectations that the business will earn more in the future.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
