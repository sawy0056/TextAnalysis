It had risen a cumulative 4.5% in three prior sessions, hitting $70.75 on Monday, its highest since mid-September.West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, slid 80 cents, or 1.3%, to $62.47. WTI had risen more than 3% net over the past three sessions, reaching a more-than-eight-month high of $64.72 on Monday.Oil prices were driven up in the last two sessions largely by the U.S. killing of Iran’s top general, Qassem Soleimani, on Friday that set the two countries on a collision course.“The ‘pain trade’ is not up for oil prices in the near term,” said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at the ICAP (LON:NXGN) commodities brokerage in Durham, N.C. “While the outcome of the market could be explosive under the right scenario (with) Iran retaliation, there is clearly more selling in the market than buying.”A rash of tensions had put the Middle East and the world on the edge after Soleimani's killing.Iran said it was abandoning limits to uranium enrichment, a step required for making nuclear weapons. Iraq’s parliament voted to expel U.S. forces from the country, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten Baghdad with sanctions. Rockets also fell all over Iraq on Monday, with no human casualties reported. Separately, fighting broke out in Libya.Tehran and Washington also exchanged strike threats. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed “harsh revenge” for Soleimani’s death while Trump said he has identified 52 targets in Iran, including sites of cultural prominence, in a plan for a counter attack that may be “disproportionate”. The U.S. Defense Department later downplayed the idea the U.S. would hit non-military targets.But with Iran still mired with internal troubles after a stampede at Soleimani’s funeral that killed dozens of people, and leaders of the Islamic republic saying they would avenge his death at the time of their choosing, global markets, including that of oil, have tried to move on.Related ArticlesU.S. oil industry launches ad campaign touting emissions cutsGold Holds Near Six-Year High as Traders Await Iran’s Next MovesOil Prices Fall Despite Continuing U.S.-Iran ConflictReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIsrael's Netanyahu: security hawk with record term in officeAFPKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergStephen Colbert, Trevor Noah Get Religion On The Coronavirus OutbreakDeadlineOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergIowa Recount Confirms Buttigieg Caucus Win: Campaign UpdateBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
