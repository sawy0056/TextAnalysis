("AGMEX"), a company incorporated in the Republic of Mali ("Mali"). The Consideration Shares have been issued in accordance with the agreement ("Agreement") between the Company and AGMEX, as announced by the Company on 01 February 2019. The Agreement relates to the acquisition of a 3% Net Smelter Return ("NSR") royalty held by AGMEX on the Company's 100% owned 24 km2 Lakanfla gold project ("Lakanfla"). Lakanfla is subject to an earn-in and royalty joint venture ("JV") with Glomin Services Ltd ("Glomin") and is located 6 km southeast of the Sadiola gold mine in western Mali and 5 km east of the Company's Diba oxide gold project.Highlights:Acquisition of a 2% NSR on the Company's Lakanfla gold project in western MaliDrilling preparations underway at Lakanfla under the JV with GlominHistorical Lakanfla drill results include 26.0m at 5.10 g/t Au and 12.0m at 9.78 g/t AuLakanfla is 6 km from Sadiola and 5 km from the Company's Diba oxide gold projectAltus retains an option to acquire the remaining 1% NSR on LakanflaSteve Poulton, Chief Executive of Altus, commented:"We are pleased to have concluded the acquisition of a 2% NSR royalty on our Lakanfla gold project in western Mali. The project is strategically located 6 km southeast of the karst-type FE3 and FE4 open pits which form part of the world renowned Sadiola gold mine and 5 km east of our own Diba oxide gold project. Sadiola has reportedly exhausted its oxide reserves and it has recently been announced that Allied Gold Corp has entered into an agreement to acquire the 82% interest in Sadiola currently held by IAMGOLD and AngloGold, with the balance being retained by the Government of Mali."Lakanfla contains a significant area of artisanal gold workings and historical drilling has returned excellent results, including 5.10 g/t Au over 26.0m, 9.78 g/t Au over 12.0m and 5.61 g/t Au over 14.5m. Based on our review of the project's historical data, we believe that Lakanfla has the potential to host a substantial karst-style gold target, analogous to the adjacent open pits at Sadiola. Preparations for a phase one drilling programme at Lakanfla are now underway, as part of the JV we recently announced with Glomin. We look forward to updating shareholders on the progress of the Lakanfla JV in due course".Lakanfla: Strategic LocationLakanfla is located in western Mali, approximately 5 km east of the Company's Diba (‘Korali Sud') oxide gold project and approximately 6 km southeast of the karst-type FE3 and FE4 open pits of the multi-million ounce Sadiola gold mine.
