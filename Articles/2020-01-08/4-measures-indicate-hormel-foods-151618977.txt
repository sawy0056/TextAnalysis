When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Hormel Foods How Much Debt Does Hormel Foods Carry?As you can see below, at the end of October 2019, Hormel Foods had US$250.0m of debt, up from US$625 a year ago. Click the image for more detail. But it also has US$687.6m in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$437.6m net cash.NYSE:HRL Historical Debt, January 7th 2020MoreHow Strong Is Hormel Foods's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Hormel Foods had liabilities of US$1.11b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$1.08b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$687.6m and US$594.3m worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$901.5m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Given Hormel Foods has a humongous market capitalization of US$23.7b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Hormel Foods also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Hormel Foods's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year, but that shouldn't be an issue given the it doesn't have a lot of debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Hormel Foods's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Hormel Foods has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the most recent three years, Hormel Foods recorded free cash flow worth 65% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Summing upWe could understand if investors are concerned about Hormel Foods's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$437.6m. So we don't think Hormel Foods's use of debt is risky. We'd be motivated to research the stock further if we found out that Hormel Foods insiders have bought shares recently.
