Protagonist also has an option to co-detail PTG-200 and related compounds in the U.S. market.About PTG-200 (JNJ-67864238)PTG-200 is an oral peptide interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) antagonist being co-developed with Janssen for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and is initially in development for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease. PTG-200 is designed to offer choices to patients in addition to injectable antibody therapeutics that target the IL-23 pathway, including the potential for improved safety and tolerability and better compliance compared to therapeutics administered by injection. Results from a Phase 1 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose escalation study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that PTG-200 was well tolerated, with pharmacokinetic measures consistent with its design as a compound restricted to the gastrointestinal system. Protagonist and Janssen are jointly conducting a global, randomized, double blind, Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of PTG-200 in 90 patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.
