This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Public Joint Stock Company Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works (MCX:MAGN), by way of a worked example.Over the last twelve months Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works has recorded a ROE of 18%. That means that for every RUB1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated RUB0.18 in profit. View our latest analysis for Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works:18% = US$1.0b ÷ US$5.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works has a better ROE than the average (14%) in the Metals and Mining industry.MISX:MAGN Past Revenue and Net Income, January 7th 2020MoreThat's what I like to see. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works's Debt And Its 18% ROEAlthough Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.16 is still low. The fact that it achieved a fairly good ROE with only modest debt suggests the business might be worth putting on your watchlist. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
