We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. For example, we sympathize with anyone who was caught holding Eros Resources Corp. (CVE:ERC) during the five years that saw its share price drop a whopping 76%. Even worse, it's down 14% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. View our latest analysis for Eros Resources Eros Resources recorded just CA$41,455 in revenue over the last twelve months, which isn't really enough for us to consider it to have a proven product. We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems that the investors focused more on what could be, than paying attention to the current revenues (or lack thereof). For example, investors may be hoping that Eros Resources finds some valuable resources, before it runs out of money.As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. There is usually a significant chance that they will need more money for business development, putting them at the mercy of capital markets. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt. Some Eros Resources investors have already had a taste of the bitterness stocks like this can leave in the mouth.Our data indicates that Eros Resources had CA$3.4m more in total liabilities than it had cash, when it last reported in September 2019. That puts it in the highest risk category, according to our analysis. But with the share price diving 25% per year, over 5 years , it's probably fair to say that some shareholders no longer believe the company will succeed.

There's no way to know its value easily. Given that situation, would you be concerned if it turned out insiders were relentlessly selling stock? I'd like that just about as much as I like to drink milk and fruit juice mixed together. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Eros Resources had a tough year, with a total loss of 20%, against a market gain of about 17%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 25% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm.
