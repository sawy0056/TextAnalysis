Also, Fire TV in vehicles will be available with Alexa and touch screen interface.The latest move of Amazon marks a breakthrough in the in-vehicle entertainment space.Strategic Partnerships Hold PromiseThe e-commerce giant is on a partnership spree with the automakers in a bid to explore opportunities for Fire TV in the in-vehicle entertainment market, which is poised to witness sustainable demand and increasing flow of investments.Moreover, the company has collaborated with automobile companies like BMW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU to introduce Fire TV in their cars. Moreover, these cars will be the first ones to feature Fire TV.Further, Amazon has joined forces with VOXX International VOXX owned VOXX Automotive, which is known for its rear-seat entertainment. The companies together will develop solutions and services in a bid to build development cycle of Fire TV for automakers.Additionally, VOXX has signed a supply agreement with one of the largest automobile companies in order to integrate Fire TV into the latter’s vehicles by 2021.Furthermore, Amazon is working with Garmin GRMN to accelerate the Fire TV development cycle in vehicles.We believe all these strong endeavors are likely to bolster Amazon’s footprint in the in-vehicle entertainment market.Amazon.com, Inc.
