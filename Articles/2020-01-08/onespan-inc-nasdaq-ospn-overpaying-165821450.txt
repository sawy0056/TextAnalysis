This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. Check out our latest analysis for OneSpan How Does Scott Clements's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?At the time of writing, our data says that OneSpan Inc. has a market cap of US$715m, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$2.4m for the year to December 2018. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at US$450k. We further remind readers that the CEO may face performance requirements to receive the non-salary part of the total compensation. We examined companies with market caps from US$400m to US$1.6b, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was US$2.6m.That means Scott Clements receives fairly typical remuneration for the CEO of a company that size. Although this fact alone doesn't tell us a great deal, it becomes more relevant when considered against the business performance.The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at OneSpan has changed from year to year.NasdaqCM:OSPN CEO Compensation, January 7th 2020MoreIs OneSpan Inc.
