But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So consider, for a moment, the misfortune of Empir Group AB (STO:EMPIR B) investors who have held the stock for three years as it declined a whopping 75%. That would be a disturbing experience. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 41% lower in that time. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 13% in the last three months. See our latest analysis for Empir Group Because Empir Group made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.In the last three years, Empir Group saw its revenue grow by 21% per year, compound. That is faster than most pre-profit companies. So on the face of it we're really surprised to see the share price down 37% a year in the same time period. The share price makes us wonder if there is an issue with profitability. Ultimately, revenue growth doesn't amount to much if the business can't scale well. If the company is low on cash, it may have to raise capital soon.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).OM:EMPIR B Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered Empir Group's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Empir Group shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 74%, over the last 3 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Empir Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 38% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 32%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 17% over the last half decade. We realise that Buffett has said investors should 'buy when there is blood on the streets', but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality businesses.
