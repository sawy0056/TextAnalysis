Two professors and more than 60 students from Kellogg School of Management will conduct its 16th consecutive Kellogg School Super Bowl Advertising Review. The students grade the advertisements in real time based on strategic criteria known as ADPLAN and produce a final ranking of their most – and least – effective advertisers. Professors Derek Rucker and Tim Calkins co-lead the school's Ad Review and can discuss topics such as:
• What advertising trends can viewers expect this year?      • Does the political climate impact what marketers have planned for the Super Bowl?      • What makes for a winning or losing Super Bowl ad?      • Why does a Super Bowl ad cost so much?      • What are some of the best and worst advertisements from past Super Bowl campaigns?
