How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.With Apache yielding 3.9% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 3.2% of market capitalisation this year. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.

If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Although it reported a loss over the past 12 months, Apache currently pays a dividend. When a company recently reported a loss, we should investigate if its cash flows covered the dividend.Last year, Apache paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.Is Apache's Balance Sheet Risky?Given Apache is paying a dividend but reported a loss over the past year, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 2.16 times its EBITDA, Apache's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 1.44 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Apache, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Apache's latest financial position,

Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Apache has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.60 in 2010, compared to US$1.00 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.2% a year over that time.Story continuesDividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. It's good to see Apache has been growing its earnings per share at 51% a year over the past five years.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Apache's dividend is not well covered by free cash flow, plus it paid a dividend while being unprofitable. Next, growing earnings per share and steady dividend payments is a great combination. Ultimately, Apache comes up short on our dividend analysis. It's not that we think it is a bad company - just that there are likely more appealing dividend prospects out there on this analysis.Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
