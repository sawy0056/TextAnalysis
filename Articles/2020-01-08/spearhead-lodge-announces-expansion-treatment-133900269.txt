She holds a Master of Social Work Degree from Savanna State University (Go Tigers!) and is a Certified Daring Way-Candidate.  Brittney believes that "shame is at the core of many of our addictions and relationship limitations.  If we can learn to talk about shame and take away its power, we can live much more fulfilled lives and have deeper connections with others."Brittney is an avid softball player after playing college softball for 3 years. She plays on the BRC softball team in the Austin Sober League and is trained in Trauma Conscious Yoga Instruction.

She is passionate about teaching and training and brings many years of counseling experience to the SHL team.Spearhead Lodge Specializes In Treating Dual Diagnosis ClientsLed by Alex Kudisch, MD, DFAPA, a triple-board certified psychiatrist, the Spearhead Lodge medical team is working hard to provide an additional avenue of support to our clients with co-occurring disorders.  Clients meet with our team of medical professionals weekly to ensure that their physical well-being and psychiatric health progress in tandem with their recovery from addictive illness while in our care.  In tandem with our Master's Level clinicians and our specialty therapy offerings, Dr. Kudisch's team of providers engage clients in motivational psychotherapy and medication management. Dr. Kudisch quickly developed a passion for the field of mental health. "When I went into psychiatry," he says, reflecting on his early years, "I was immediately challenged by how patients presented with their clinical symptoms. There is very little objectivity in how to understand and arrive at a diagnosis." The challenge in diagnoses is perhaps easy to underestimate. "If you have someone who is diabetic, for example, you can do blood tests to find out," he says. "But there's no blood test for mental disorder. There's only a clinical interview and observation to lead you to diagnose and decide what you are going to call it. I was always intrigued by that kind of challenge."Dr. Kudisch was born in the capital city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Dr. Kudisch came to the United States with his family at the age of five. He and his wife, Evelia, who is also medically trained, were married during his residency and fellowship work in child psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. They have 2 sons.  Dr. Kudisch joined the team at BRC in October of 2018 and is supported by a team of physicians and Nurse Practitioners who work closely with each Spearhead Lodge client.About Spearhead LodgeSpearhead Lodge is a stand-alone program within the BRC Recovery Family of Programs.
