To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Wai Kee Holdings:0.025 = HK$235m ÷ (HK$13b - HK$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Wai Kee Holdings has an ROCE of 2.5%.

ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. You can check if Wai Kee Holdings has cyclical profits by looking at this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.What Are Current Liabilities, And How Do They Affect Wai Kee Holdings's ROCE?Current liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Wai Kee Holdings has total liabilities of HK$3.9b and total assets of HK$13b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 29% of its total assets. This is not a high level of current liabilities, which would not boost the ROCE by much.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Wai Kee Holdings's ROCEThat's not a bad thing, however Wai Kee Holdings has a weak ROCE and may not be an attractive investment.
