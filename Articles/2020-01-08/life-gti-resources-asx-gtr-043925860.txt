But unfortunately, some companies simply don't succeed. Zooming in on an example, the GTI Resources Limited (ASX:GTR) share price dropped 60% in the last half decade. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 38% in the last three months. See our latest analysis for GTI Resources With just AU$696,648 worth of revenue in twelve months, we don't think the market considers GTI Resources to have proven its business plan. We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems that the investors focused more on what could be, than paying attention to the current revenues (or lack thereof). It seems likely some shareholders believe that GTI Resources will find or develop a valuable new mine before too long.We think companies that have neither significant revenues nor profits are pretty high risk. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some companies like this go on to deliver on their plan, making good money for shareholders, many end in painful losses and eventual de-listing. It certainly is a dangerous place to invest, as GTI Resources investors might realise.GTI Resources had cash in excess of all liabilities of just AU$80k when it last reported (June 2019). So if it hasn't remedied the situation already, it will almost certainly have to raise more capital soon. With that in mind, you can understand why the share price dropped 17% per year, over 5 years .

Given that situation, would you be concerned if it turned out insiders were relentlessly selling stock? I would feel more nervous about the company if that were so. It only takes a moment for you to check whether we have identified any insider sales recently.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered GTI Resources's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. We note that GTI Resources's TSR, at -51% is higher than its share price return of -60%. When you consider it hasn't been paying a dividend, this data suggests shareholders have benefitted from a spin-off, or had the opportunity to acquire attractively priced shares in a discounted capital raising.A Different PerspectiveGTI Resources shareholders are down 10% for the year, but the market itself is up 24%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, longer term shareholders are suffering worse, given the loss of 13% doled out over the last five years. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm.
