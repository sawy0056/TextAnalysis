In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the company achieved 3% comps growth on lowes.com, driven by solid efforts to enhance online business.

Further, it intends to enhance customers’ shopping experience by introducing features — including one-click checkout and scheduling delivery. Such well-chalked efforts are likely to drive the company’s comps. In fact, management anticipates total sales growth of 2%, with comparable sales expected to rise 3% in fiscal 2019.The company also remains optimistic about the home improvement business, driven by rising income and real residential investment. Notably, comparable sales for the U.S. home improvement business grew 3% in the third quarter.
