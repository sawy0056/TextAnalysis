People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried - and - true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.Retirement investing approaches of the past don't work today.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren't producing income? You can only cut your expenses so far, and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace current low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.For example, AT&T and Coca-Cola are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3% or better. Look for stocks like this that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.AbbVie (ABBV) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.07 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.79%. This compares to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.65% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.79%. In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.28 is up 11.46% from last year.Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is paying out a dividend of 0.36 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.63% compared to the Retail - Restaurants industry's yield of 0% and the S&P 500's yield. Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.44 is up 9.09% from last year.Currently paying a dividend of 0.14 per share, First Horizon National (FHN) has a dividend yield of 3.48%. This is compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 1.83% and the S&P 500's current yield. Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $0.56 is up 16.67% from last year.But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.You may be thinking, "I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF." This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.Story continuesBottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement.To learn more ways to maximize your assets - and avoid pitfalls that could jeopardize your financial security - download our free report:Will You Retire a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do NowGet Your FREE Guide Now AbbVie Inc.
