Up until now, plant-based sausage has been dominated by rival Beyond Meat (BYND).Impossible Foods didn’t disclose when the pork product would become available to consumers. For now, it’s just being tested at the conference, via samples handed out to attendees of the tech product extravaganza, according to the company.“Impossible Foods cracked meat’s molecular code -- starting with ground beef, which is intrinsic to the American market. Now we’re accelerating the expansion of our product portfolio to more of the world’s favorite foods,” said Patrick Brown, Impossible Foods’ founder and CEO, in a statement.“We won’t stop until we eliminate the need for animals in the food chain and make the global food system sustainable,” he added.

The new product reveals come on the heels of the Impossible Burger 2.0 debut at last year’s event.In fact, it’s the only food company to be featured at CES this year.“Impossible Foods has fundamental platform technology that has been in the works for last 8 years that apply to all our products,” CFO David Lee told Yahoo Finance via email — which he boasted uses only “a fraction of the time a typical food company take.”Lee added: “That’s why CES for the last two years is such a great way to announce new products.”Later this month, the company will debut the Impossible Sausage breakfast sandwich exclusively at 139 Burger King restaurants. The faux sausage will be found on Burger King’s popular Croissan’wich breakfast sandwich. It will take aim at the successful Beyond Meat breakfast sausage sandwich, launched at over 9,000 U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts locations in October 2019.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
