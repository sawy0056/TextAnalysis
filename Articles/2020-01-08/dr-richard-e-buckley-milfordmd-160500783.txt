Buckley of MilfordMD Cosmetic Dermatology Surgery & Laser Center Comments on Paula Abdul's Secrets to Looking Great After 50PR NewswireJanuary 7, 2020ReblogShareTweetSharePaula Abdul, absolutely stunning at 57, recently shared the latest cosmetic treatments she used to retain glowing, youthful skin. Cosmetic surgeon Dr. Richard E. Buckley comments on these and other anti-aging regimens for women and men in their 50s.MILFORD, Pa., Jan. 7, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Iconic singer, choreographer and actress Paula Abdul isn't just known for her amazing musical talent and being one of the most successful female artists of all time, but also for looking absolutely flawless in her 50s. At 57 years old, Paula started her first Las Vegas residency and shared in interviews her secrets to making it through 10 hour rehearsals and aging gracefully. While stretching, pilates, eating healthy and a trainer help her sail through intense rehearsals, her most recent credit to looking great goes to radio frequency tightening devices.When it comes to the best anti-aging regimen for people in their 50s, Dr. Richard E. Buckley, a cosmetic surgeon and Medical Director of MilfordMD Cosmetic Dermatology and Laser Center in Milford, PA, recommends first focusing on the four body areas with the most publicly visible aging. The four areas of the body to concentrate on are the face, neck, chest and hands, according to Dr. Buckley. "In all these areas the skin thickness has decreased, collagen turnover lessens, and the subcutaneous tissues that support the skin have thinned and become less supportive causing deflation and depression. Additionally, the skin tends to get rougher with time as cell turnover goes down and it starts to sag. These are all areas that can easily and nicely be corrected utilizing a combination of cosmetic treatments. To address the signs of aging in these areas, we focus on helping the surface and superficial layers of the skin, as well as tightening and lifting the supportive tissues under the skin, volumizing the areas, and color correcting pigmentation issues," says Dr. Buckley.To smooth out the surface of the skin, Dr. Buckley recommends regular treatments that exfoliate and resurface the skin such as HydraFacial MD®. Using patented technology, the award-winning HydraFacial MD® device cleanses, extracts and hydrates the skin with super serums containing nourishing antioxidants and peptides which maximize glow. It takes non-invasive skin rejuvenation to a whole new level and is the only hydradermabrasion device that uses the patented 4-in-1 Vortex Technology™.The ultra-fine microneedling AQUAGOLD® fine touch™ device is used to reach and treat the superficial layer of the skin. AQUAGOLD® fine touch™ is the world's foremost revolutionary microinjector device that precisely and comfortably delivers microdoses of therapeutics into the skin. "With AQUAGOLD® fine touch™ we can drive hyaluronic sugars, such as Restylane or Juvederm, and neuromodulators, such as Dysport and Botox, down into the skin. We can also place platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the skin, and we can drive the patient's own (autogolous) nano-fat, which is micronized fat, down into the very superficial layers of the skin. The hyaluronic fillers, PRP, and nano-fat help with skin restoration and stimulates new collagen formation," states Dr. Buckley."The face, neck, chest and hands can benefit from skin tightening treatments, as they all experience sagging as a result of aging and loss of elasticity. Our energy-based, FDA-cleared devices, such as Thermage and Ultherapy, are ideal to use in these areas," says Dr. Buckley. At MilfordMD, Dr. Buckley prefers Thermage for the skin surface, as it is considered the gold-standard radio frequency skin tightening device for the face, eyes and body and has no downtime. When it heats the dermal tissue it contracts the collagen bundles causing thickening and tightening of the skin and subcutaneous layer below the surface. As the collagen fibrils heal, they are reshaped and new collagen forms, which tightens the skin even more.To get the best results, Dr. Buckley often combines skin tightening treatments like Thermage with skin lifting treatments like Ultherapy®. As Dr. Buckley says, "you wouldn't really think about only grabbing the surface of the skin and pulling it up. The surface of the skin you'd want to tighten. But the deeper down tissues that the skin is lying on top of would want to be lifted. We use Ultherapy® which is the only non-invasive, FDA-approved device for skin lifting." Ultherapy® uses highly-focused ultrasound (HiFU) energy to stimulate collagen production and tightening deep within your skin to plump, firm and lift the skin.Story continuesIn addition to treating the surface and superficial layers of the skin; tightening the skin; and lifting the skin, all four body areas can benefit from being volumized with fillers. "The fillers would range from one's own fat or AFT (autogolous fat transfer), to synthetic hyaluronic acid fillers, such as Restylane and Juvederm, to calcium hydroxylapatite fillers like Radiesse, and to bio-stimulatory agents like PLLA (Sculptra)," states Dr. Buckley. "These fillers provide a nice, quick fix for the depression and deflation in the face, neck, chest and hands, thus helping you look younger."Also, with time, especially as you hit 50 and older, the effect of the environment, especially the sun, on the skin becomes more visible in the form of pigmentation, brown spots, red spots and even blood vessels coming to the surface of the skin. "If you look at the skin of a young person it's very clear. If you look at the skin of someone in their 50s who has spent time in the sun and never had any cosmetic treatments it's going to be spotted," says Dr. Buckley. "At MilfordMD, we can do color correction with our lasers and IPL devices to help blend in pigmentation, get rid of brown and red spots to help the skin be clear again." One of Dr. Buckley's go-to color correction treatments are IPL Photofacials. IPL treatments are great because they decrease facial redness, reduce pore size, lessen the appearance of pigmented spots and improve skin texture and fine lines, only take 20-30 minutes, and have no downtime.To get the best anti-aging results in your 50s, it's not only about the areas of the body and treatments used. As Dr. Buckley says, "it's important for patients to seek a physician who understands anatomy and is interested in anti-aging aesthetic treatments. You want someone who is a student of the process of aging and knows how to reverse the signs of aging. The treatments that physicians use are tools to achieve artistic results. For example, you wouldn't ask a painter what type of paint brush they are using or a carpenter what type of hammer they are using. So, you don't necessarily want to decide where to go for advice and treatments based on devices so much as you will want to choose a physician who understands aging, how to reverse the signs of aging and has a lot of experience and tools at their disposal to achieve your desired results."For women who want to look as fabulous as Paula and ask "how can I look younger in my 50s," it's about strategically addressing all the signs of aging in the most visible areas. As Dr. Buckley states, "Aging is multi-factorial. As such the treatments to address it are also multi-factorial. There isn't a single treatment that is going to resolve all the issues of aging. It is this combination of substances and devices that will help reverse the effect we call aging and help you look amazing in your 50s and beyond."About MilfordMD Cosmetic Dermatology Surgery & Laser Center:The MilfordMD Cosmetic Dermatology Surgery & Laser Center offers state-of-the-art highly specialized procedures in laser and cosmetic surgery and aesthetic skin care.
