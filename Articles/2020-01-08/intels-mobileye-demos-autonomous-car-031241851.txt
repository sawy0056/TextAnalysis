The chipmaker's demo is notable as self-driving car technology companies generally pair cameras with other sensors like radar or lidar to help the vehicle "see" its surroundings.The video showed the car navigating through four-way intersections with no traffic lights, and changing lanes to weave into traffic and avoid pedestrians.In the video, Mobileye, Intel's Israel-based autonomous driving unit, said its technology can create 3D models from 2D camera images to help an autonomous driving system better sense the environment. It said the processing is done with two of its latest autonomous driving EyeQ5 chips.Mobileye also said it can merge the information from its camera-only system with that from radar and lidar systems to use together on self-driving cars.(Reporting by Jane Lanhee Lee; Editing by Christopher Cushing)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMarvell Semiconductor lays off close to 100 people at Santa Clara HQAmerican City Business JournalsAMD, Apple, Intel lead Silicon Valley stock sell-off as coronavirus fears in U.S. growAmerican City Business JournalsIntel bars travel to countries hit by coronavirus as market sell-off slams its stockAmerican City Business JournalsIntel loses and English wins in a refreshingly simple SCOTUS decisionQuartzMicrosoft shares slip after warning of coronavirus hit to supply chainReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
