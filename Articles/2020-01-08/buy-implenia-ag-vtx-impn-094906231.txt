But is this actually reflective of the share value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Implenia’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Implenia Is Implenia still cheap?Great news for investors – Implenia is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is CHF71.98, but it is currently trading at CHF38.58 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Implenia’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Implenia look like?SWX:IMPN Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Implenia, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting top-line growth of 7.2% in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since IMPN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IMPN for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IMPN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
