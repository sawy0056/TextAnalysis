The filing must give 60 days' notice prior to any formal layoffs.Economic conditions, insurance liability increases and a general overcapacity in the marketplace after some fleets expanded to meet 2018 demand led to many high-profile closures of carriers in 2018.Celadon, New England Motor Freight, Falcon Transport and LME are among the companies that closed in 2018.
