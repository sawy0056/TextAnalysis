Yoga and meditation are known to have many health benefits including improved focus, creativity, stress management, mental wellbeing and more. "Yoga and meditation make great resolutions because they are the practice of continuous self-reflection," said Tolino. "We are constantly evolving and require the proper attention from ourselves to remain motivated and productive. These reflective practices give people the opportunity to unwind, regain clarity, and remember that we are one piece of a larger puzzle. Yoga and meditation practices increase innovation because of the vulnerability and empathy that the practice builds. It allows us to work towards the best version of ourselves, both in the office and at home," Tolino continued.With the new year just beginning, several employee's resolutions revolve around the commitment to their yoga and meditation practices."The meditation room at SupplyHouse.com has provided a perfect avenue for me to break up my day," said Krystle Remington, SupplyHouse.com Product Support Specialist.
