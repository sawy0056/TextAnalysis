All-on-4 helps those who suffer from multiple missing teeth to benefit from a stabilized, natural-looking set of replacement teeth. This state-of-the-art tooth replacement option permanently restores function, smile aesthetics, and confidence.All-on-4 full arch dental implants consist of four dental implant posts placed in the jawbone. Like natural tooth roots, the posts stimulate surrounding bone, reducing the likelihood of bone recession. Due to the unique angle at which they are placed, All-on-4 dental implants can often eliminate the need for bone grafting. Once fully osseointegrated with the surrounding bone, full mouth dental implants act as the foundation for an attractive, custom bridge of new teeth. Drs. Krakora and Humberger ensure these final teeth restorations, often made from Zirconia, fit beautifully and comfortably on the dental implants, are durable, and look natural.All-on-4 dental implants offer an alternative to traditional dentures, restoring both patients' health and their quality of life. As with all single dental implants, full mouth dental implants have a high success rate, making them a preferred treatment among patients with multiple failing or missing teeth, and for those who currently wear dentures.The team at Western Pennsylvania & Ohio Valley Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery focuses on making all aspects of dental implant placement as comfortable as possible. "It was just painless, quick and easy," says Dani, a patient of Dr. Krakora's, while describing her experience with dental implant placement. "The staff is so friendly and nice, and the doctor is very professional."Individuals with missing teeth who would like to discuss receiving full mouth dental implants, for one or both arches of their mouth, are invited to contact Drs. Krakora and Humberger at their Washington, PA or Steubenville, OH practice locations.
