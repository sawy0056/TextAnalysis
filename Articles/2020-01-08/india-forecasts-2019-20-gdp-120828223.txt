The financial year ends in March.Gross domestic product is estimated to grow 5.0% in 2019/20, slower than the 6.8% growth of 2018/19, the Ministry of Statistics said in a statement.Indian growth had slowed to 3.1% in 2008/09 after the global financial crisis."The slowdown in economic growth implies the government will have to come up with a fiscal stimulus in the budget," said N.R. Bhanumurthy, economist at National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a Delhi-based think-tank.He said latest growth numbers would impact revenue estimates and government spending for the next financial year. Growth was likely to be around 6-6.5% in 2020/21, he said, following a steady a recovery.Manufacturing is forecast to grow 2.0% in 2019/20, compared to 6.9% growth in 2018/19, the Ministry of Statistics said.Construction is likely to grow 3.2% in 2019/20, compared to 8.7% the previous year, while the farm sector is forecast to grow 2.8%, compared to 2.9% a year earlier, the statement said.Private economists expect growth to steadily pick up in the next fiscal year. Data so far this year points to a weaker-than expected activity, with global trade tensions and rising crude oil prices posing risks.The unemployment rate rose to 7.7% in December from 7% a year earlier, data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai-based think tank, showed.The statistics ministry will release growth data for the October-December quarter on Feb. 28, along with revised full-year growth estimates.($1 = 71.7550 rupees)(Additional reporting by Aftab Ahmed; editing by Nick Macfie)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergHere are 5 reasons the stock market is having its worst decline since 2008, and only one of them is the coronavirusMarketWatchHow investors are using ‘alternative’ data to track China’s recovery from coronaviruMarketWatchBank of Canada to stay put for now, but 2020 rate cut in play: Reuters pollReutersWorld stocks set for worst week since 2008 as virus fears grip marketsReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
