It has amassed assets over $423.09 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.08%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.70%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise.

Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.24% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Jpmorgan Chase & Co (JPM).The top 10 holdings account for about 22.69% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskEPS seeks to match the performance of the WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Index before fees and expenses. The WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Index is a fundamentally weighted index that measures the performance of earnings-generating companies within the large-capitalization segment of the U.S. Stock Market.The ETF return is roughly 0.27% so far this year and is up about 31.13% in the last one year (as of 01/07/2020). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $28.93 and $36.97.The ETF has a beta of 1.05 and standard deviation of 12.80% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space.
