However, Wall Street recovered the next trading day on Jan 6.The Wall Street bull run is likely to continue in this year buoyed by an expected interim trade deal between the United States and China. A stable domestic economy is the biggest positive for U.S. stocks. Moreover, an accommodative Fed is likely to be a cushion for stock markets.At this stage, wouldn’t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further?Sounds good? Here’s how to execute it:One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run. Actually, stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward.If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend, there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed. So, looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational.However, recent price strength alone cannot create magic. Therefore, you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy.Here’s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners.Screening Parameters:Percentage Change in Price (4 Weeks) greater than zero: This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks.Percentage Change Price (12 Weeks) greater than 10: This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months. This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period.Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Average Broker Rating 1: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock’s future performance.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Current Price/ 52-Week High-Low Range more than 85%: This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52-week highs. It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price.Just these few criteria have narrowed down the search from over 7,700 stocks to just 12.Here we present five stocks out of the 12:Cassava Sciences Inc.
