Only videos generated by artificial intelligence to depict people saying fictional things will be taken down," Facebook said in a statement."Once the video of Speaker Pelosi was rated by a third-party fact-checker we reduced its distribution, and critically, people who saw it, tried to share it or already had received warnings that it was false".Facebook has been criticized over its content policies by politicians from across the spectrum. Democrats have blasted the company for refusing to fact-check political advertisements, while Republicans have accused it of discriminating against conservative views, a charge that it has denied. In the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, social platforms have been under pressure to tackle the threat of deepfakes, which use artificial intelligence to create hyper-realistic videos where a person appears to say or do something they did not.(Reporting by Mekhla Raina in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFacebook Cancels Annual Conference Due to Coronavirus Concerns: 'This Was a Tough Call to Make'PeopleGrandfather, Navy vet among 5 victims of Wisconsin shootingAssociated PressPelosi: Congress Close to a Bipartisan Deal on Coronavirus FundingThe Fiscal TimesWhoopi Goldberg questions why President Trump appointed Mike Pence to lead coronavirus response: 'He's setting him up'Yahoo TVBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
