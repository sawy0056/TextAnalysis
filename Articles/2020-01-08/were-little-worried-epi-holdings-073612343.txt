For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.So should EPI (Holdings) (HKG:689) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). The first step is to compare its cash burn with its cash reserves, to give us its 'cash runway'. Check out our latest analysis for EPI (Holdings) Does EPI (Holdings) Have A Long Cash Runway?A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. In June 2019, EPI (Holdings) had HK$136m in cash, and was debt-free. In the last year, its cash burn was HK$201m. So it had a cash runway of approximately 8 months from June 2019. To be frank, this kind of short runway puts us on edge, as it indicates the company must reduce its cash burn significantly, or else raise cash imminently. The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.SEHK:689 Historical Debt, January 7th 2020MoreIs EPI (Holdings)'s Revenue Growing?Given that EPI (Holdings) actually had positive free cash flow last year, before burning cash this year, we'll focus on its operating revenue to get a measure of the business trajectory. Regrettably, the company's operating revenue moved in the wrong direction over the last twelve months, declining by 21%. In reality, this article only makes a short study of the company's growth data. This graph of historic earnings and revenue shows how EPI (Holdings) is building its business over time.How Hard Would It Be For EPI (Holdings) To Raise More Cash For Growth?Given its problematic fall in revenue, EPI (Holdings) shareholders should consider how the company could fund its growth, if it turns out it needs more cash. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.Since it has a market capitalisation of HK$445m, EPI (Holdings)'s HK$201m in cash burn equates to about 45% of its market value. That's high expenditure relative to the value of the entire company, so if it does have to issue shares to fund more growth, that could end up really hurting shareholders returns (through significant dilution).How Risky Is EPI (Holdings)'s Cash Burn Situation?EPI (Holdings) is not in a great position when it comes to its cash burn situation. While its falling revenue wasn't too bad, its cash burn relative to its market cap does leave us rather nervous. Considering all the measures mentioned in this report, we reckon that its cash burn is fairly risky, and if we held shares we'd be watching like a hawk for any deterioration.
