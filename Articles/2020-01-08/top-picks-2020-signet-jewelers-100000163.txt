For years, Signet was managed as a growth company. Sales nearly doubled from 2011 to 2015, driven by healthy same store sales, new stores, and acquisitions including the $1.5 billion purchase of Zales in 2014.See also::

Efforts to outsource the credit operations only seemed to make matters worse.Signet shares remain heavily out of favor, down 85% from their late 2015 peak. However, a new leadership team (since late 2017) and a revamped board are overhauling Signet’s operations, including offering more relevant products and services, closing stores in weak malls, boosting its ecommerce business and streamlining its costs.The credit operations have been fully outsourced and the related decline in sales appears to have been cycled through. Recent results indicate good progress although the turnaround is only about half-completed so far.See also: Top Picks 2020: Shopify (SHOP)Signet has a reasonable balance sheet and generates plenty of free cash flow to cover its dividend, currently producing a 7.3% yield. The shares trade for an appealing 4.8x EBITDA multiple. For disclosure, employees of the publisher of The Turnaround Letter own shares of this stock.(Editor's note: George Putnam chose General Electric (GE) as his Top Pick for 2019. With the shares up 54%, the advisors says, "We continue to have a "buy" rating on GE. The upcoming completion of the BioPharma sale will greatly improve GE’s liquidity, while progress on other priorities should lead to higher earnings and lower risks.")More From MoneyShow.com:Top Picks 2020: Corning (GLW)Top Picks 2020: AbbVie (ABBV)Top Picks 2020: ViacomCBS (VIAC)Top Picks 2020: Ladder Capital (LADR)Top Picks 2020: Franco-Nevada (FNV)Top Picks 2020: Qualcomm (QCOM)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
