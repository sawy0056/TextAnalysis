But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. That downside risk was realized by HRnetGroup Limited (SGX:CHZ) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 20%. That's well bellow the market return of 8.3%. HRnetGroup may have better days ahead, of course; we've only looked at a one year period. View our latest analysis for HRnetGroup To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, HRnetGroup had to report a 19% decline in EPS over the last year. This proportional reduction in earnings per share isn't far from the 20% decrease in the share price. Therefore one could posit that the market has not become more concerned about the company, despite the lower EPS. Rather, the share price is remains a similar multiple of the EPS, suggesting the outlook remains the same.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).SGX:CHZ Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, HRnetGroup's TSR for the last year was -17%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile HRnetGroup shareholders are down 17% for the year (even including dividends) , the market itself is up 8.3%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Putting aside the last twelve months, it's good to see the share price has rebounded by 7.8%, in the last ninety days. Let's just hope this isn't the widely-feared 'dead cat bounce' (which would indicate further declines to come). Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can
