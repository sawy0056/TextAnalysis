Seven bidders are for retail banks and the rest are for wholesale banks."These include e-commerce firms, technology and telecommunications companies, FinTechs (such as crowd-funding platforms and payment services providers) and financial institutions," the MAS said on Tuesday.The online-only banks are expected to operate at lower costs and offer services that differ from local incumbents such as DBS Group <DBSM.SI> and OCBC <OCBC.SI>.Firms have joined forces to combine banking and technology expertise and meet local licensing requirements, which are generally stricter than other markets such as Hong Kong. Retail bank licence holders, for example, will need S$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in paid-up capital.Some contenders hope deep customer data combined with new technology will help them win customers in Singapore, which has over 150 deposit-taking institutions and about $2 trillion in total assets under management."One of the key motivations for seeking a Singapore digital bank license is that it is easier to demonstrate a proven track record and regional connectivity to other regulators in ASEAN where digital banks are going to be available in coming time," said Varun Mittal, who heads the emerging markets fintech business at consultancy EY.Singapore is issuing up to two retail and three wholesale bank licences.Accredited retail digital banks will be able to accept deposits from and offer services to both retail and non-retail customers, although they must be headquartered in Singapore and controlled by Singaporeans.Wholesale banks will mostly serve small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and will not be subject to local control restrictions.Singapore will announce the winners in June and digital banks are set to start operations in a phased manner from mid-2021.($1 = 1.3487 Singapore dollars)(Reporting by Anshuman Daga, additional reporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Tom Hogue, Sam Holmes and Himani Sarkar)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOil’s Worst Week Since 2014 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergWhy Russia Is Completely Ignoring This New German-Made SubmarineThe National InterestDraper-Backed Exchange in Lockdown Following ‘Sophisticated’ AttackCoindeskCanada issues travel health notice for seven countries amid COVID-19 outbreakYahoo News CanadaBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
