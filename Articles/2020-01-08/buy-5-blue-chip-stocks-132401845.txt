On that day, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — retreated 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively, reflecting their worst trading day in a month.However, Wall Street recovered the next trading day on Jan 6. Initially, the indexes opened with sharp losses. At their lowest points on Monday, the Dow was down 0.9%, the S&P 500 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.8%. However, major indexes finished Jan 6 trading with a gain of 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, marking their best single-day turnaround since Oct 3, 2019.Upcoming Phase-One Trade Deal to Usher Market RecoveryOn Jan 6, The South China Morning Post reported that Chinese officials are set to arrive in Washington on Jan 13 for a four-day meeting with U.S. top-level delegates in order to sign an interim trade pact known as the phase-one trade deal. Last week, President Donald Trump said that he will sign the preliminary trade deal on Jan 15.The deal is expected to at least prevent further escalation of tariff war between the two largest trading countries of the world. An interim trade deal is likely to restore U.S. business confidence significantly which in turn will lead the sagging manufacturing sector toward a rebound.Dow Firmly in the Green Despite FluctuationsSeveral economists and financial researchers have feared that geopolitical conflict in Iran has escalated oil prices to their highest level in four years. Further, escalation of oil prices may generate recessionary tendencies in several emerging countries, which will affect global economic recovery.Against this backdrop, the blue-chip index has surged, defying all odds. The Dow rallied 22.3% in 2019. This was an excellent performance after a disappointing 2018 when the blue-chip index had lost nearly 6%. Continuing this trend, in the first three trading days of this year, the index is up 0.6%. In 2019, the Dow crossed the technically vital 28,000 level for the first time and is currently firmly settled above this physiological barrier.On Jan 6, the Dow closed at 28,703.38, well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 27,878.89 and 26,755.34, respectively. In financial literature, the 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term trend setter, while the 200-day moving average is considered as the long-term trend setter.It is widely recognized in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility.Our Top PicksAt this stage, it will be prudent to invest in blue-chip stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong dividend yield, which will act as a regular income stream to investors.
