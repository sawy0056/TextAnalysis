Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection damages its own tissues and organs. SeptiCyte™ technology evaluates the patient's own immune response to infection to aid clinicians in quickly and accurately diagnosing sepsis.Details of the presentation are as follows:Event:                  Biotech Showcase 2020Date:                    Monday, Jan. 13, 2020Time:                   9:45 a.m. PSTLocation:              Hilton San Francisco Union SquareRoom:                  Franciscan B (Ballroom Level)About Immunexpress Immunexpress is a Seattle-based molecular diagnostic company committed to improving outcomes for patients suspected of sepsis. Immunexpress' SeptiCyte™ technology rapidly quantifies, directly from whole blood, specific molecular markers from the patient's own immune system – the 'host response'. SeptiCyte™ LAB, recently cleared by the FDA, is the first of its kind in using the host immune system to differentiate systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. Detecting the host's response to infection has the potential to differentiate infection earlier, faster and more accurately than finding the invading pathogen because it is independent of whether or not the pathogen is present in the sample. Immunexpress' pipeline includes several sample-to-answer assays for near-patient testing.For more information visit http://www.immunexpress.com/.Follow Immunexpress on Twitter and LinkedIn.Media Contacts: Maggie BellerRusso Partners, LLC+1(646) 942-5631Maggie.beller@russopartnersllc.comCisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/immunexpress-to-present-at-biotech-showcase-2020-in-san-francisco-300982233.htmlSOURCE Immunexpress, Inc.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBaidu Becomes Latest Tech Giant to Deliver Disappointing OutlookBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
