This new paradigm, which brings Nature back to the interiors, will inspire the next edition of Architect@Work London, scheduled for January 29th and 30th. A theme as natural as the products that A Cimenteira do Louro (ACL) will present at today's biggest architectural and design event.Materiality, sensory design and nature are concepts that are exciting architects and designers and will be debated at A@W London 2020, under the theme Sensory Design - Acting Natural: new ways in which architecture and the environment converge. For two days, The Old Truman Brewery will be the scene of a rich exchange of knowledge and human relations. At number 23, ACL will present 5 collections of wallcoverings and pavements that made success in the latest editions of A@W. Siena, Vértices, Hando Plus, Riscado Plus and Dex are the products that fully materialize this new stream that explores the endless ways of providing holistic sensory experiences to the users of a space - commercial, private and public.The three-dimensionality and perfect imitation of the colors and textures of natural elements, present in the Portuguese landscape, such as stone and wood, define the performative and aesthetic excellence of ACL products, which are fully developed based on concrete, a composite of organic products, that the Portuguese company reuses 100%. The vital need for a return to authenticity and the attention to multisensory stimuli, are the new challenges of today. In line with this trend, that uses technology to recreate and ennoble natural materials, ACL distinguishes with products that transform spaces and atmospheres and sublimate the human experience.Sophistication, bold design and sensoriality is what Portugal's most international wallcovering and flooring company will present in London, at the end of January, to Architecture and Interior Design professionals, with the promise of inspiring their next projects.Contact: Joana Ferreira, +351-919-560-806, jf@aclweb.pt, joanaferreira.acl@gmail.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextUS, European stocks plunge, extending rout amid virus fearsAFPArsenal knocked out of Europa League in dying seconds by OlympiakosAFPA First Look At JW Anderson X Uniqlo’s Latest CollectionRefinery29/C O R R E C T I O N -- National Kidney Foundation/PR NewswirePrince George & Princess Charlotte’s School Is Having A Coronavirus ScareRefinery29Biocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
