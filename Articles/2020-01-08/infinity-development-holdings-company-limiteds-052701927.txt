To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Infinity Development Holdings Company Limited (HKG:640).Over the last twelve months Infinity Development Holdings has recorded a ROE of 16%. That means that for every HK$1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated HK$0.16 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Infinity Development Holdings How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Infinity Development Holdings:16% = HK$66m ÷ HK$409m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Mean?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does Infinity Development Holdings Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Infinity Development Holdings has a superior ROE than the average (12%) company in the Chemicals industry.SEHK:640 Past Revenue and Net Income, January 7th 2020MoreThat's what I like to see. I usually take a closer look when a company has a better ROE than industry peers. One data point to check is if insiders have bought shares recently.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Infinity Development Holdings's Debt And Its 16% ROEInfinity Development Holdings has a debt to equity ratio of just 0.012, which is very low. The fact that it achieved a fairly good ROE with only modest debt suggests the business might be worth putting on your watchlist. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises.In SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.
