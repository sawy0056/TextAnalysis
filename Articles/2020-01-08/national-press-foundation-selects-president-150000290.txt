I look forward to working with her during the transition."Efron will be introduced at NPF's annual journalism awards dinner on Feb. 13, and will become president and COO effective Jan. 29."I am deeply honored to pick up the mantle from Sandy Johnson and lead an organization that has been serving journalism since 1976," Efron said.
