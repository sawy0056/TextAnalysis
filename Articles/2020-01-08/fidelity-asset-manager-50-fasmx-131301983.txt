FASMX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.ObjectiveFASMX is classified in the Allocation Balanced segment by Zacks, which is an area full of possibilities. Here, investors are able to get a good head start with diversified mutual funds, and play around with core holding options for a portfolio of funds. Allocation Balanced funds look to invest across a balance of asset types, like stocks, bonds, and cash, though including precious metals or commodities is not unusual; these funds are mostly categorized by their respective asset allocation.History of Fund/ManagerFidelity is responsible for FASMX, and the company is based out of Boston, MA. Fidelity Asset Manager 50% made its debut in December of 1988, and since then, FASMX has accumulated about $9.29 billion in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. Geoffrey D. Stein is the fund's current manager and has held that role since June of 2009.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 5.64%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 8.14%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. FASMX's standard deviation over the past three years is 6.44% compared to the category average of -36.2%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 6.5% compared to the category average of 0.01%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors cannot discount the risks to this segment though, as it is always important to remember the downside for any potential investment. In FASMX's case, the fund lost 34.81% in the most recent bear market and outperformed its peer group by 21%. This could mean that the fund is a better choice than comparable funds during a bear market.Even still, the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.51, so investors should note that it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&P 500. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -0.51. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.ExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, FASMX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.63% compared to the category average of -34.81%. From a cost perspective, FASMX is actually more expensive than its peers.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineOverall, Fidelity Asset Manager 50% ( FASMX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, worse downside risk, and higher fees, this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.This could just be the start of your research on FASMXin the Allocation Balanced category.
