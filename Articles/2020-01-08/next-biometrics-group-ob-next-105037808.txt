For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether NEXT Biometrics Group (OB:NEXT) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). The first step is to compare its cash burn with its cash reserves, to give us its 'cash runway'. Check out our latest analysis for NEXT Biometrics Group How Long Is NEXT Biometrics Group's Cash Runway?A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. In September 2019, NEXT Biometrics Group had kr132m in cash, and was debt-free. In the last year, its cash burn was kr119m. Therefore, from September 2019 it had roughly 13 months of cash runway. While that cash runway isn't too concerning, sensible holders would be peering into the distance, and considering what happens if the company runs out of cash.

this visualization of its revenue and earnings history.How Easily Can NEXT Biometrics Group Raise Cash?Even though it seems like NEXT Biometrics Group is developing its business nicely, we still like to consider how easily it could raise more money to accelerate growth. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.NEXT Biometrics Group has a market capitalisation of kr155m and burnt through kr119m last year, which is 77% of the company's market value. That's very high expenditure relative to the company's size, suggesting it is an extremely high risk stock.How Risky Is NEXT Biometrics Group's Cash Burn Situation?On this analysis of NEXT Biometrics Group's cash burn, we think its cash burn reduction was reassuring, while its cash burn relative to its market cap has us a bit worried. After looking at that range of measures, we think shareholders should be extremely attentive to how the company is using its cash, as the cash burn makes us uncomfortable.
