Matthews has been the CEO of Armada Data Corporation (CVE:ARD) since 2000. This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally - as a second measure of performance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. Check out our latest analysis for Armada Data How Does R. Matthews's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, Armada Data Corporation has a market capitalization of CA$1.3m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth CA$109k over the year to May 2019. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at CA$102k. We took a group of companies with market capitalizations below CA$259m, and calculated the median CEO total compensation to be CA$224k.Most shareholders would consider it a positive that R. Matthews takes less total compensation than the CEOs of most similar size companies, leaving more for shareholders. Though positive, it's important we delve into the performance of the actual business.You can see, below, how CEO compensation at Armada Data has changed over time.TSXV:ARD CEO Compensation, January 7th 2020MoreIs Armada Data Corporation Growing?Armada Data Corporation has reduced its earnings per share by an average of 75% a year, over the last three years (measured with a line of best fit). Revenue was pretty flat on last year.Unfortunately, earnings per share have trended lower over the last three years. And the flat revenue is seriously uninspiring.

Matthews is lower than is usual at similar sized companies, but the eps growth is lacking, just like the returns (over three years).
