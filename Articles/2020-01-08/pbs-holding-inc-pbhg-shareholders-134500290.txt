Our contract includes a future expansion for up to 200 acres and is fully vetted and licensed in the state of Oklahoma.

The average is approximately 300 plants per acre, and at 4 pounds per plant, at approximate 1200 pounds per acre would average $ 300.00 US per pound wholesale, would yield an approximate average of $ 3.6 Million (US) per acre.

By acquiring the companies with our preferred, and not doing "mergers" per se, this will protect us and help achieve our goals and company's plans without the fear of "notes" and reverse stock splits looming and/or being dictated by new management.
