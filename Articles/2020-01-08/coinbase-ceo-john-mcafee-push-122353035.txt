Monero is one of the most popular privacy coins for making anonymous cryptocurrency payments.Monero's recent bullish momentum may have been caused by recent comments made by John McAfee, who slammed Bitcoin (BTC) in a recent tweet, while praising newer blockchains that offer privacy features—like Monero. Eat my dick in 12 months? A ruse to onboard new users. It worked. Bitcoin was first. It's an ancient technology. All know it. Newer blockchains have privacy, smart contracts, distributed apps and more. Bitcoin is our future?
Was the Model T the future of the automobile? — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 5, 2020 This opinion appears to have been somewhat echoed by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who argued that at least one privacy coin is due for mainstream adoption this year. He said, "I believe we’ll eventually see a “privacy coin” or blockchain with built in privacy features get mainstream adoption in the 2020s."Like practically the entire cryptocurrency market, Monero began seeing significant gains on January 2 and has now appreciated by more than 30% in the last week. This recent bullish activity breaks a more than six-month-long bearish trend, which saw Monero decline from a 2019 high of almost $119 last June, down to just $44.52 on January 2, 2020.As it stands, Monero is currently leading the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies in terms of 24-hour gains, slightly edging out Bitcoin at 4.8%, while knocking Stellar (XLM) out of position as the tenth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, with January historically being one of the worst months for cryptocurrencies, it remains to be seen how long Monero can keep going strong.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
