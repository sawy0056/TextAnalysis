This information is transferred to TomTom’s cloud-based fusion engine, currently used for its industry leading traffic data service – TomTom Traffic. TomTom would then deliver the hazard information to all navigation and ADAS applications running TomTom’s connected services in the same manner it delivers its traffic data, helping drivers make better decisions that save time, reduce stress and create safer roads.“We’re excited that together with TomTom, we are helping to build a smart cities ecosystem,” said John Nunneley, Design Engineering SVP, Hitachi Automotive Systems Americas, Inc.  “This solution will give vehicles the intelligence to detect, distribute and leverage real-time road condition data with other vehicles and municipalities to minimize delays, increase safety, and execute repairs.”“Developing innovative real-time hazard services for navigation and automated driving will ultimately create a safer and less congested world, which is exactly what TomTom is all about,” said Ralf-Peter Schäfer, TomTom’s Head of Traffic and Travel Information.  “It’s imperative to align ourselves with forward-thinking companies in order to advance mobility so we’re thrilled to be working with Hitachi Automotive Systems Americas.”Hitachi Automotive Systems Americas looks to provide a connected AD/ADAS ECU platform that is capable of supporting Hitachi Automotive Systems’ onboard applications as well as 3rd party service applications.  This platform aims to be the key enabler to deliver more scalable, secure and reliable Connected Services to both businesses and end users.About TomTomTomTom is the leading independent location technology specialist, shaping mobility with highly accurate maps, navigation software, real-time traffic information and services.
