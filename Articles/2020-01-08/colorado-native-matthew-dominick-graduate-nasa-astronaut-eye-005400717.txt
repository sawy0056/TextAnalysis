The NASA candidates, including Dominick, were chosen from a record-setting pool of more than 18,000 applicants. The CSA candidates have been training alongside their NASA classmates.Dominick, a U.S. Navy lieutenant commander, was born and raised in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. He earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of San Diego and a master's degree in systems engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. He also graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Maryland. Dominick was at sea on the USS Ronald Reagan, serving as department head for Strike Fighter Squadron 115, when he got the call saying he'd been selected as an astronaut candidate.All astronaut candidates have completed training in spacewalking, robotics, ISS systems, T-38 jet proficiency, and Russian language. At the ceremony, each candidate will receive an astronaut pin, marking their graduation from basic training and their eligibility to be selected to fly in space.As astronauts, they'll help develop spacecraft, support the teams currently in space and ultimately, have the opportunity to join the ranks of only about 500 people who have had the honor of going into space. NASA continues its work aboard the space station, which is preparing to mark the 20th consecutive year of humans living onboard in November 2020. The agency also is on the verge of launching Americans from American soil aboard commercial spacecraft and is preparing to send humans to the Moon as part of the Artemis program.Find additional photos of the astronaut candidates and their training here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa2explore/albums/72157698260056092  CisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/colorado-native-matthew-dominick-to-graduate-as-nasa-astronaut-with-eye-on-artemis-missions-300982155.htmlSOURCE NASAReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTwo-time spaceflier Charles Simonyi offers advice for commercial space travelersGeekWireThe Weeks Before Graduation Were the Most Stressful, Until I Got My Schedule on TrackPopSugarBiggest explosion seen in universe came from black holeAssociated PressAfter flying in space twice, Microsoft billionaire Charles Simonyi follows his passion: whiteboardsGeekWireKatherine Johnson Was My Daughter’s Hero And She’s Grieving Her DeathScary MommyBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
