Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.First, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Chinese People Holdings:0.042 = CN¥107m ÷ (CN¥3.1b - CN¥549m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Chinese People Holdings has an ROCE of 4.2%. See our latest analysis for Chinese People Holdings Does Chinese People Holdings Have A Good ROCE?ROCE is commonly used for comparing the performance of similar businesses.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. Remember that most companies like Chinese People Holdings are cyclical businesses.

The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Chinese People Holdings has total assets of CN¥3.1b and current liabilities of CN¥549m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 18% of its total assets. This is not a high level of current liabilities, which would not boost the ROCE by much.Story continuesOur Take On Chinese People Holdings's ROCEWhile that is good to see, Chinese People Holdings has a low ROCE and does not look attractive in this analysis.
