We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Flughafen Zürich AG's (VTX:FHZN), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is Flughafen Zürich's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 17.80. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying CHF17.80 for every CHF1 in prior year profit. Check out our latest analysis for Flughafen Zürich How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Flughafen Zürich:P/E of 17.80 = CHF172.10 ÷ CHF9.67 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does Flughafen Zürich Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (17.6) for companies in the infrastructure industry is roughly the same as Flughafen Zürich's P/E.SWX:FHZN Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 7th 2020MoreThat indicates that the market expects Flughafen Zürich will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. The company could surprise by performing better than average, in the future. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.It's nice to see that Flughafen Zürich grew EPS by a stonking 31% in the last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 6.6% per year over the last five years. So we'd generally expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does Flughafen Zürich's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Flughafen Zürich has net debt worth 12% of its market capitalization. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.The Bottom Line On Flughafen Zürich's P/E RatioFlughafen Zürich trades on a P/E ratio of 17.8, which is below the CH market average of 20.1. The EPS growth last year was strong, and debt levels are quite reasonable. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. So this free visual report on analyst forecasts could hold the key to an excellent investment decision.But note: Flughafen Zürich may not be the best stock to buy.
