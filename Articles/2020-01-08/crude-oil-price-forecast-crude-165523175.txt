However, there are still plenty of reasons to think that the oil markets will be noisy at the very least, and perhaps explosive if things get worse. To the upside, I see the $65 level as massive resistance, and the fact that we could not break above there is something to pay attention to. However, there are a lot of headlines risks out there just waiting to cause issues. If we were to break above the $65 level, it would be extraordinarily bullish. If we are getting ready to break down below the $61 level, then the market will probably go looking towards the 50 day EMA after that.Oil Forecast Video 08.01.20BrentBrent markets also gapped lower and then shot towards the $60 level. The market looks likely to go down towards the $67.50 level, possibly even the $66 level after that. After forming a massive shooting star at resistance and the psychologically important $70 handle, it makes sense that we would get a bit of a pullback. We have recently seen the “golden cross” form when the 50 day EMA crosses above the 200 day EMA, so don’t be surprised at all if longer-term traders are still trying to push this market to the upside. That being said, a pullback could be thought of as a buying opportunity so perhaps waiting for a bit of a bounce at lower levels might be the best way to play this market.Please let us know what you think in the comments belowThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
