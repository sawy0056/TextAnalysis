WorkWave PestPac has also been named a finalist in this year's Cloud Awards for Best Software as a Service in the U.S. WorkWave PestPac empowers pest control companies of all sizes to transform their business processes to drive strong business results. Enterprise customers in particular have unique challenges when servicing commercial customers, as they can expect to be faced with more robust business processes and services, alongside an expectation of the highest-level service and thorough auditing. "Every pest control company we work with is seeking to drive growth, and with this growth comes increased complexity, especially for mid-market and enterprise customers. We are continuing our strong focus on making PestPac scalable, easy-to-use, yet robust enough to handle everything from digital marketing, to real-time field communications, to reporting and billing - all with seamless execution," said David F. Giannetto, CEO of WorkWave. "It is our mission to empower our customers to reach their full potential, and WorkWave is unique in the industry - PestPac is the only solution with the depth and breadth of features and functionality that allow pest control organizations of all sizes to generate more revenue and increase profitability in every area of their business."While the term "enterprise" is typically associated with larger companies, WorkWave views every pest control company as an enterprise account, and proposes a PestPac software solution based upon both a company's size and their commercial versus residential service mix. PestPac Select, a new, simpler and easier-to-use version of PestPac, is designed for smaller, residential pest control companies, while those performing commercial work will utilize the larger PestPac platform that contains additional functionality required for this type of work.This commercial-oriented functionality includes capabilities such as the CustomerConnect+ and Online Sales portals. Designed to help customers improve their cash flow despite the complexity of commercial contracts, these tools allow for online and on-demand scheduling, optimization, invoicing and payment of service calls, combined with the ability to capture, manage, and easily access account information, records, and audit-ready documentation to meet compliance and record-keeping requirements via any phone, tablet, or computer. These tools also allow for 24x7 access for both commercial customers and other stakeholders, such as auditors, to further reduce the need for additional office workers.Since 2011, Best in Biz Awards' entrants have spanned the spectrum from the most innovative local companies and start-ups, to some of the most recognizable global brands.
