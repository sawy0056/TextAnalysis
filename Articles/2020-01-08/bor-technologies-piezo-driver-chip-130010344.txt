Piezo haptic solutions from Boréas and TDK are uniquely positioned to give automotive manufacturers and suppliers what they want most: uncompromising performance, small size, enduring reliability, and unparalleled power efficiency.”To meet the needs of the automotive market, Boréas is partnering with TDK, the world’s leading supplier of piezoelectric haptic actuators.“Touch HMIs in cars are evolving with the times,” said Stefan Benkhof, head of product marketing of the TDK Piezo Business Unit. “From the knobs and buttons of one-hundred years ago to the flat screens that came to market over the last twenty years, clear and responsive haptics marks the next important interface advancement in automobiles. It’s companies like Boréas and TDK that are responsible for such advancements. We’re delighted that our combined technologies offer the clearest, most realistic and long-lasting piezo haptic solutions to our automotive customers around the world.”Safer Driving through Piezo HapticsTouch-based HMIs in cars are here to stay. More than 52.8 million automotive touch panels will be on the market by 2020, according to IHS Markit Center Stack Display Production Forecast, and that number is growing by 4.6% annually. At the same time, more drivers are using voice commands to make phone calls and send texts, and are receiving navigation instructions via audio. Although handsfree HMIs might sound like they’re safer for drivers, research from Stanford Universityi — which compared skin-stretch haptic feedback on the car’s steering wheel to auditory feedback for in-car navigation — concluded that drivers receiving haptic feedback responded better than those receiving audio feedback, and there’s a biological reason for that: Haptic feedback presents “a smaller cognitive load than the audio cues when driving while aurally or verbally distracted.”A research study conducted by the United States Air Force and Arizona State Universityii concluded that drivers responded more effectively to tactile warnings, delivered via the gas pedal or the seat than to visual or auditory warnings when alerted to rear-end collisions. While research on whether tactile vs. auditory or visual stimuli leads to more distracted driving is ongoing, some researchers agree that the cognitive load on the human brain is less when that feedback is tactile.Piezo Haptics at CES 2020TDK will showcase its lineup of 120V PowerHap piezo haptic actuators during CES 2020, January 7-10, 2020 at the TDK booth (LVCC, Central Hall, # 11448). Boréas will help to drive TDK’s haptic actuators into automotive applications and is available for demonstrations by appointment only at the Boréas booth (LVCC, South Hall 4, #35824) — as well as at the TDK booth.To schedule a meeting with Boréas, please email: sales@boreas.caAbout the BOS1211The BOS1211 is a high-voltage low-power piezo driver IC that is based on Boréas’ patented CapDrive™ technology, a proprietary scalable piezo driver architecture that provides the foundation for Boréas’ haptic chips. CapDrive delivers the advantages of piezoelectric material to the designer: greater energy efficiency, low heat dissipation and rapid response times, making CapDrive chips ideal for devices in which size, power, responsiveness and thermal management are essential.
