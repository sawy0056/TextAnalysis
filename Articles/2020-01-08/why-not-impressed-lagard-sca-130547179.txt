To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Lagardère:0.057 = €345m ÷ (€11b - €4.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Lagardère has an ROCE of 5.7%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Lagardère.How Lagardère's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCECurrent liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Lagardère has total liabilities of €4.8b and total assets of €11b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 44% of its total assets. Lagardère's ROCE is improved somewhat by its moderate amount of current liabilities.Our Take On Lagardère's ROCEDespite this, its ROCE is still mediocre, and you may find more appealing investments elsewhere.
