Summary The era of smart devices has emerged as a result of continuous technological advancements. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-based conductive coatings are the most widely used transparent conductive coating across the world. ITO-based coatings are highly transparent and conductive, due to which they are used across a wide range of touch screen and display applications.However, the price fluctuations and limited geographical availability associated with indium have compelled the industry to search for cheaper non-ITO-based conductive materials with improved properties. In recent years, conductive nanoparticles, other doped metal oxides, and conductive polymers have emerged as promising replacements for ITO-based transparent conductive coatings. The major applications of transparent conductive coatings include touch screens and displays, OLED lighting, and PV cells.The market is currently dominated by touch screen and display applications. However, the market of transparent conductive coatings for thin-films PV cells is expected to grow at a rapid pace over the forecast period.Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05837256/?utm_source=PRN About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
