(WORX) announced today a further expansion of its customer base with a prestigious hospital system in the Northeast with a five-year, minimum $1 million contract for its proprietary ScanWorx, the company’s service offering. The agreement represents increased market validation of the company’s ScanWorx application, which is its trademarked application and part of a suite of proprietary applications that collectively referred to as SCWorx, to significantly improve operating and financial performance by increasing automation involved in documenting cases in hospital procedural areas while simultaneously providing accurate information for use in patient billing systems.“Senior hospital executives representing finance, perioperative and materials departments, are increasingly recognizing that the ScanWorx solution provides the best opportunity to achieve hospitals’ financial goals of reducing costs and increasing procedure-based margins without sacrificing patient outcomes,” commented Marc Schessel, CEO of SCWorx. “Implementation of this contract will enhance the hospital system’s patient safety via the increased granular transparency delivered by the SCWorx platform through its data management tools and advanced integration modules, forming a natural ‘closed loop’ processing solution from which hospitals can effectively maximize revenues, reduce product costs and drive better clinical outcomes in a replicating and sustainable fashion.” Mr. Schessel continued, “While this is an important step forward for this hospital system and SCWorx, it is just the initial step in a process that will ultimately tie all departments in the hospital system together so that its management can drive one clear vision and mission for the communities they serve. We are privileged that the hospital system continues to entrust SCWorx with such a pivotal role in this far reaching, transformative project and look forward to driving further growth.” About SCWorx Corp.
