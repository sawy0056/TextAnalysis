But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, Eurocell plc (LON:ECEL) shareholders have seen the share price rise 34% over three years, well in excess of the market return (5.5%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 19% in the last year , including dividends . View our latest analysis for Eurocell There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Eurocell was able to grow its EPS at 0.3% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 10% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).LSE:ECEL Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Eurocell's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Eurocell, it has a TSR of 50% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the market return was 19% in the last year, Eurocell returned 19% to shareholders. That's not at all bad, but the cherry on top is that it's an improvement on prior returns (since shareholders only made 15% yearly over the last three years). We're certainly happy to see the uptick and we hope the underlying business goes on to justify the improved valuation.
