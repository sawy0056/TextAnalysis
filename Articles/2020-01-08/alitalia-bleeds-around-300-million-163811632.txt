He said Lufthansa was still interested in working with the Italian group.A commercial partnership with Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> would boost revenues at the ailing Italian airline by 100 million euros annually in the medium term, Eberhart said.Lufthansa would also be interested in Rome's Fiumicino airport as a new hub for Southern Europe, the German manager said.He said Alitalia should join Lufthansa in the Star Alliance, the world's largest group of carriers, allowing them to cooperate on marketing routes and pricing.($1 = 0.8977 euros)(Reporting by Francesca Landini; Writing by Giulio Piovaccari; Editing by Jan Harvey)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAs American deploys China aircraft to other routes, analysts raise pricing impact worriesAmerican City Business JournalsAirline Stock Roundup: Gol's Q4 Earnings Miss, Coronavirus Fears & MoreZacksDelta to Trim Flights to South Korea Under Coronavirus ScareZacksSpirit (SAVE) Launches International Service From AustinZacksTop Ranked Growth Stocks to Buy for February 27thZacksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
