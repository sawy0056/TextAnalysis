(Emza), a provider of smart visual sensor solutions allowing for the wide adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in a variety of applications and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Himax Technologies, Inc. (HIMX), announced today that Innolux has integrated Himax-Emza human sensing technology into its monitors to assure privacy protection in real time.WiseEye intelligent vision solution is based on Emza’s unique AI-based machine-learning trainable algorithms, on top of Himax’s proprietary computer vision processor and CMOS image sensor – all equipped with ultra-low power design. By integrating the WiseEye module into its displays, Innolux enriches its displays with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance user experience in the following ways:Real-Time Privacy ProtectionInnolux’s advanced displays have the ability to change their field of view electronically in order to protect against unwanted viewers. With contextual awareness, the monitor senses someone peeking over the user’s shoulder, and immediately enters privacy mode.Instant Wake UpThe monitor goes on automatically when the user faces it, for a richer user experience.Energy SavingsThe display operates in normal mode only when the user is present. If the user walks away, it enters low-power mode automatically.“Sight-based human sensing is revolutionizing the display industry,” explained James Yang, President of Innolux. “We believe the Himax-Emza intelligent visual sensor solution is best-of-breed in terms of AI enablement, narrow bezel dimensions and pricing suitable for mass production.”“Our WiseEye intelligent vision solution has been proven in the notebook industry in 2019. The collaboration with Innolux in the monitor application is a further validation of the suitability of our technology to a wide range of markets,” added Yoram Zylberberg, CEO of Emza. “Innolux is one of the leading providers of TFT-LCD displays in the world. We look forward to further expanding the partnership with Innolux into other applications beyond monitors, such as TVs, in the future.”Innolux invites everyone attending CES in Las Vegas on January 7-10, 2020, to its live demo at the Bellagio Hotel.About Innolux CorporationInnolux Corporation is one of the world's leading TFT-LCD total solution manufacturers, having strong presence in both large-size panels and small & medium size products.
