For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. But while the successes are well known, investors should not ignore the very many unprofitable companies that simply burn through all their cash and collapse.So should Homes & Holiday (FRA:HHH) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves. See our latest analysis for Homes & Holiday Does Homes & Holiday Have A Long Cash Runway?A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. Homes & Holiday has such a small amount of debt that we'll set it aside, and focus on the €1.2m in cash it held at June 2019. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through €3.6m. That means it had a cash runway of around 4 months as of June 2019. With a cash runway that short, we strongly believe that the company must raise cash or else douse its cash burn promptly. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.DB:HHH Historical Debt, January 7th 2020MoreHow Well Is Homes & Holiday Growing?Some investors might find it troubling that Homes & Holiday is actually increasing its cash burn, which is up 28% in the last year. And we must say we find it concerning that operating revenue dropped 12% over the same period. Taken together, we think these growth metrics are a little worrying. Of course, we've only taken a quick look at the stock's growth metrics, here. You can take a look at how Homes & Holiday has developed its business over time by checking
this visualization of its revenue and earnings history.How Hard Would It Be For Homes & Holiday To Raise More Cash For Growth?Since Homes & Holiday can't yet boast improving growth metrics, the market will likely be considering how it can raise more cash if need be. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash to fund growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).Homes & Holiday's cash burn of €3.6m is about 67% of its €5.4m market capitalisation. That's very high expenditure relative to the company's size, suggesting it is an extremely high risk stock.Is Homes & Holiday's Cash Burn A Worry?There are no prizes for guessing that we think Homes & Holiday's cash burn is a bit of a worry. In particular, we think its cash runway suggests it isn't in a good position to keep funding growth. And although we accept its falling revenue wasn't as worrying as its cash runway, it was still a real negative; as indeed were all the factors we considered in this article. Once we consider the metrics mentioned in this article together, we're left with very little confidence in the company's ability to manage its cash burn, and we think it will probably need more money. While we always like to monitor cash burn for early stage companies, qualitative factors such as the CEO pay can also shed light on the situation.
