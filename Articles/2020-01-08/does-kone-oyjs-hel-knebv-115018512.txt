And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term KONE Oyj (HEL:KNEBV) shareholders have enjoyed a 57% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 29% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 44% in the last year , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for KONE Oyj There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, KONE Oyj managed to grow its earnings per share at 3.6% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 9.5% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).HLSE:KNEBV Past and Future Earnings, January 7th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on KONE Oyj's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, KONE Oyj's TSR for the last 5 years was 88%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that KONE Oyj shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 44% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Is KONE Oyj cheap compared to other companies?
