We'll look at Maire Tecnimont S.p.A.'s (BIT:MT) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Based on the last twelve months, Maire Tecnimont's P/E ratio is 7.66. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 13.1%. Check out our latest analysis for Maire Tecnimont How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Maire Tecnimont:P/E of 7.66 = €2.50 ÷ €0.33 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Maire Tecnimont's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company.

Since the market seems unimpressed with Maire Tecnimont, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Maire Tecnimont saw earnings per share decrease by 8.0% last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 30% per year over the last five years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does Maire Tecnimont's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Net debt is 26% of Maire Tecnimont's market cap. While that's enough to warrant consideration, it doesn't really concern us.The Bottom Line On Maire Tecnimont's P/E RatioMaire Tecnimont's P/E is 7.7 which is below average (18.5) in the IT market.
