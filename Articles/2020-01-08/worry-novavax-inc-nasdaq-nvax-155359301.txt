(NASDAQ:NVAX). This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally we will reflect on how common stockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of performance. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. Check out our latest analysis for Novavax How Does Stan Erck's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?At the time of writing, our data says that Novavax, Inc. has a market cap of US$107m, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$4.2m for the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$638k. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We took a group of companies with market capitalizations below US$200m, and calculated the median CEO total compensation to be US$524k.It would therefore appear that Novavax, Inc. pays Stan Erck more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into the underlying business performance.The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at Novavax has changed from year to year.NasdaqGS:NVAX CEO Compensation, January 7th 2020MoreIs Novavax, Inc.
