Bidding continued Tuesday after the total on Monday surpassed NT$100 billion, 98% of which was for rights to use the 3.5GHz band.The rising costs for licenses shows carriers expect the faster networks -- due later this year in Taiwan -- will provide a market advantage over competitors. The auction results so far are “blowing away expectations,” New Street Research analysts said in a note dated Jan. 6.“There is no sign that the bidding will end soon,” Sheih Chi-mau, chairman and chief executive officer of the island’s biggest carrier Chunghwa Telecom, said Monday night in remarks at a company event. “It may take a few more days. The competition is fierce.”While some other sales of 5G spectrum in similar bands have drawn bigger totals, Taiwan’s is the richest relative to population, according to New Street.C-Band Analyst Says Spectrum Auction May Net $50 BillionThe Taiwanese bids set a new bar of $0.51 per megahertz pop -- an industry term that takes into account both the bandwidth and population that the carrier is paying for -- which New Street Research analyst Vivek Stalam says is $0.10 above the previous high reached during Italy’s mid-band spectrum sale in 2018.An airwaves sale in Italy last year drew $7.6 billion, the most after Germany’s $7.4 billion sale. Taiwan’s population of 24 million is less than half of Italy’s 60 million and Germany’s 83 million.Stalam said Taiwan’s bidding war suggests strong demand for mid-spectrum airwaves like the 3.5Ghz band in other markets, including for a U.S. sale of the so-called C-Band that could bring about $50 billion.The final spectrum fee total in Taiwan is expected to reach NT$114.9 billion, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a Jan. 2 note. That amount would fall slightly shy of the NT$118.7 billion Taiwan raised from its 4G auction in 2013.China Offers 5G Discounts in Race to Scale Biggest NetworkTaiwan has about 29 million mobile phone accounts, an average of more than one per person, but its neighbor China has more than a billion. What makes Taiwanese subscribers especially attractive is that they’re the biggest consumers of data in Asia, according to researcher Tefficient. Average per-user data consumption at Taiwan’s carriers reached as high as 17.6GB per month, compared with 7.6GB in China and 8.5GB in South Korea.South Korean carriers established the world’s first full commercial 5G services last April. They are expected to have reached 5 million subscribers by the end of 2019. Operators in other countries including the U.S., U.K., Japan and Australia have also offered limited services to the public with plans to introduce wider networks this year.To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Dave McCombs, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergStudents Step Up Protests Against Thailand’s Army-Backed PremierBloombergBaidu Becomes Latest Tech Giant to Deliver Disappointing OutlookBloombergIcahn Proposed Buying HP If It Didn’t Pursue Xerox MergerBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
