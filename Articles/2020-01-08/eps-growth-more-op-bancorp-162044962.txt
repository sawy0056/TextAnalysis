But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like OP Bancorp (NASDAQ:OPBK). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for OP Bancorp How Quickly Is OP Bancorp Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price will eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that OP Bancorp has managed to grow EPS by 24% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of OP Bancorp's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. OP Bancorp maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 13% to US$54m. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

So it is good to see that OP Bancorp insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. To be specific, they have US$30m worth of shares. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Those holdings account for over 19% of the company; visible skin in the game.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like OP Bancorp with market caps between US$100m and US$400m is about US$1.1m.The OP Bancorp CEO received US$952k in compensation for the year ending December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. While the level of CEO compensation isn't a huge factor in my view of the company, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Is OP Bancorp Worth Keeping An Eye On?Given my belief that share price follows earnings per share you can easily imagine how I feel about OP Bancorp's strong EPS growth. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. Each to their own, but I think all this makes OP Bancorp look rather interesting indeed.
