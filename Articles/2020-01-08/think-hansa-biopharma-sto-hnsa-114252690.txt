For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed. Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed.Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Hansa Biopharma (STO:HNSA) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. See our latest analysis for Hansa Biopharma How Long Is Hansa Biopharma's Cash Runway?You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. Hansa Biopharma has such a small amount of debt that we'll set it aside, and focus on the kr680m in cash it held at September 2019. Importantly, its cash burn was kr320m over the trailing twelve months. So it had a cash runway of about 2.1 years from September 2019. Importantly, analysts think that Hansa Biopharma will reach cashflow breakeven in 4 years. Essentially, that means the company will either reduce its cash burn, or else require more cash. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.OM:HNSA Historical Debt, January 7th 2020MoreHow Is Hansa Biopharma's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?In our view, Hansa Biopharma doesn't yet produce significant amounts of operating revenue, since it reported just kr3.5m in the last twelve months. As a result, we think it's a bit early to focus on the revenue growth, so we'll limit ourselves to looking at how the cash burn is changing over time. Over the last year its cash burn actually increased by a very significant 79%. While this spending increase is no doubt intended to drive growth, if the trend continues the company's cash runway will shrink very quickly. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at our analyst forecasts for the company.How Hard Would It Be For Hansa Biopharma To Raise More Cash For Growth?Given its cash burn trajectory, Hansa Biopharma shareholders may wish to consider how easily it could raise more cash, despite its solid cash runway. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash to fund growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.Hansa Biopharma has a market capitalisation of kr3.2b and burnt through kr320m last year, which is 10% of the company's market value. Given that situation, it's fair to say the company wouldn't have much trouble raising more cash for growth, but shareholders would be somewhat diluted.Story continuesIs Hansa Biopharma's Cash Burn A Worry?Even though its increasing cash burn makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought Hansa Biopharma's cash runway was relatively promising. One real positive is that analysts are forecasting that the company will reach breakeven. Cash burning companies are always on the riskier side of things, but after considering all of the factors discussed in this short piece, we're not too worried about its rate of cash burn.
