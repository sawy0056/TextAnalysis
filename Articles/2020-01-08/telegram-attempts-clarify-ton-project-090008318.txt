Don’t get scammed,”  the firm writes.It also states nobody should expect profits based on their purchase or holding of Grams tokens, and it makes no promises that people will do so.“Grams are intended to act as a medium of exchange between users in the TON ecosystem. Grams are not investment products and there should be no expectation of future profit or gain.”According to Telegram, the native cryptocurrency does not represent any of the following:Any equity or other ownership interest in Telegram or its affiliatesAny rights to dividends or other distribution rights from Telegram or its affiliatesAny governance rights in Telegram or its affiliates The company also stresses that it will not integrate the TON wallet into the Telegram messaging service – at least not until it receives proper approval under applicable laws and governmental authorities.Telegram CEO Pavel Durov is set to testify in his deposition for the case on January 7 and 8 in Dubai.Interested in reading more Telegram-related stories?
