Tye Thompson and Jordon Green, respected dentists in Midland, TX, welcome new patients to experience the life-changing benefits of full arch dental implants. At their practice, The Dental Studio of Midland, these trusted dentists skillfully combine the art and science of dentistry in order to offer aesthetically appealing and long-lasting full arch solutions. Patients are able to have their dental implants placed one day and come back the following day for a full set of functional teeth. By using state-of-the-art technology, The Dental Studio of Midland can also craft patients' final set of natural-looking teeth from one-of-a-kind Prettau® Zirconia.Dr. Thompson's surgical skill as an implant specialist combined with Dr. Green's passion for cosmetic dentistry offers a comprehensive approach to each dental implant patient they see. Patients are able to receive precise and predictable dental implant surgery but also artistically crafted smiles all in one office. Each Prettau Zirconia restoration is designed by Dr. Green taking into consideration personalized details, such as size, color and shape, that will complement each patient.Prettau Zirconia is a highly durable material that receives little to no wear from biting, chewing, or talking. It has just enough flexibility to be sculpted into a bridge that matches a patient's specific design requests. Its non-porous composition creates a smooth finish that does not retain stains, odors, plaque, or bacteria. Plus, because the full arch is crafted from one large block, the final product is stronger than an arch that combines multiple materials.Patients who receive a full arch dental implant treatment at The Dental Studio of Midland experience accurate and immediate results. To prepare a patient's mouth for implants, Dr. Thompson can perform bone grafting and tooth extractions when needed. On the day of treatment, the team makes the patient comfortable with sedation dentistry, then Dr. Thompson will place as little as four dental implants into each jaw using minimally invasive techniques. The doctors send the patient home to heal overnight before returning the next day to receive their temporary, functional full arch dental bridge.In the few months following the treatment, the new implant posts undergo osseointegration, a process where dental implants integrate into the jawbone creating a firm and lasting bond. Once this process is complete, patients return to the office, where Dr. Green places the patient's customized, Prettau Zirconia arch within the mouth. With proper care, this arch should remain secure for the duration of the patient's life.Patients with The Dental Studio of Midland's full dental arch have gained an ability to eat steak, apples, and a variety of foods that dentures and damaged teeth do not allow. Patients can brush and maintain their full arch like natural teeth. When properly maintained, patients often keep these custom fit implants for life. Plus, at The Dental Studio of Midland, patients experience a relaxing treatment from start to finish through personalized care and sedation dentistry."Dr. Thompson has really changed the way I personally feel. Now, I can actually smile," Larry, a patient of Dr. Thompson, explains as he recounts his full arch dental implant treatment.Patients with severely damaged or missing teeth who are looking for dental implants in Midland, TX can connect with Drs.
