The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Fosun International Limited (HKG:656).What Is Insider Buying?It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, rules govern insider transactions, and certain disclosures are required.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. View our latest analysis for Fosun International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Fosun InternationalIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Non-Executive Director Sheng Man Zhang bought HK$1.2m worth of shares at a price of HK$12.44 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being HK$11.40). While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Sheng Man Zhang was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.Sheng Man Zhang purchased 450.00k shares over the year. The average price per share was HK$11.84.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.2% of Fosun International shares, worth about HK$153m.
