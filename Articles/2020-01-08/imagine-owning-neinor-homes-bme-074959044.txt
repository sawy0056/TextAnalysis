When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Unfortunately the Neinor Homes, S.A. (BME:HOME) share price slid 12% over twelve months. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 14%. Because Neinor Homes hasn't been listed for many years, the market is still learning about how the business performs. The silver lining is that the stock is up 4.0% in about a week. Check out our latest analysis for Neinor Homes To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Neinor Homes share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 397%. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.Neinor Homes managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).BME:HOME Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Neinor Homes will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).A Different PerspectiveGiven that the market gained 14% in the last year, Neinor Homes shareholders might be miffed that they lost 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. With the stock down 5.9% over the last three months, the market doesn't seem to believe that the company has solved all its problems. Given the relatively short history of this stock, we'd remain pretty wary until we see some strong business performance.
