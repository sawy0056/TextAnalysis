I believe in Dohmen's effort to shift the nation's health focus from treatment to prevention, and I feel strongly that by donating Salus to Dohmen, we'll make the greatest societal impact together."Dr. Korkor has been a passionate advocate of achieving improved mental health through exercise. He founded the Five Fifty Fifty Run / Walk series which holds 5K races annually, in which he personally participates. His idea of running a 5K race in all 50 states in 50 days is a way to create a movement that will spread from one coast to the other, one state at a time.

We are also very honored to have him join us in a strategic advisory role as we continue to build Dohmen's comprehensive preventative health offering."LaConte said she is hopeful that other company owners will consider following in Dr. Korkor's footsteps, "There is no better way to augment a company's legacy and impact, than to contribute it to a greater cause," said LaConte.About the Dohmen Company FoundationWith more than 161-years of creating equitable access to a more efficient, effective and easy-to-use health experience, Dohmen has changed its focus from treatment to prevention—and from shareholder return to social impact.
