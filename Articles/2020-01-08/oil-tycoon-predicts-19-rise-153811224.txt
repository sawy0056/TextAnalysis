Hamm foresees further price moves to the upside, with oil going as high as $75 per barrel.‘I think we’re probably headed for $75 oil price in the next six months," said Hamm. "That’s where the market’s going, and we’ll get there. It’s not too much to ask."Following the incident, things didn't calm down over the weekend as oil hit a seven-year high in Monday's trading session.
