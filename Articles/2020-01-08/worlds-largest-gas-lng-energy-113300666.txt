Three core themes that arose from discussions included:-  New centres of demands and marked changes in how gas will be utilised by end users-  Key developments in supply sources and changing market dynamics-  An increased role for its use in creating a hydrogen economyAll these underpinned by the rise of new technologies and the 4th industrial age.These themes resonate across the core energy agendas for Asia: energy security, clean energy and opening emerging economies and over the next five years, the IEA forecasts that Asia is set to power the growth of the industry. Singapore hence represents a prime opportunity for energy players to convene and drive development in the region."We are thrilled to bring the event back to Asia," said Ornstien. "Singapore is one of the most important energy and financial hubs in the world and an epicentre for important players in the gas, LNG and energy space to engage the emerging, buoyant economies of Asia with the rest of the world."Gastech draws 35,000 international visitors annually and attendees range from heads of states, government officials, ministerial and executive-level people, through to management and operational level people, as well as students."Hosting Gastech for the second time is testament to Singapore's reputation as a leading business events destination where event planners can draw on our ecosystem of opportunities, networks and ideas.
