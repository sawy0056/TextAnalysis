It argued it could not produce sufficient steel from the remaining furnaces to return the firm to profit.Tuesday's ruling gave the commissioners up to 12 months to fulfil a set of requirements to make the furnace compliant with environmental and safety rules, according to a copy of the decision seen by Reuters.The Indian-based steelmaker had also blamed its threatened exit on the Italian government's move to scrap a guarantee of legal immunity from prosecution over environmental risks while it carried out the clean-up at Ilva's heavily polluted site.Last December the commissioners and Arcelor agreed to extend their talks until Jan. 31 in a bid to find an accord.A Milan court postponed a hearing, previously scheduled in December, to Feb. 7 to discuss a government bid to stop ArcelorMittal's withdrawal from Ilva, to leave room for the negotiations.The government is also considering becoming an investor in Ilva, which directly employs around 8,200 workers in Taranto, through the state-owned agency Invitalia, Italy's Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said in November.As part of its intervention, the Italian government could sound out the willingness of some Italian creditor banks to become shareholders of Ilva, converting part of their loans into equity, Italian daily Il Messaggero reported on Tuesday.(Reporting by Alfredo Faieta; Writing by Gianluca Semeraro; Editing by James McKenzie and David Evans)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrial opens of US students accused over Italy police deathAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
