(1) EBITDA is defined as earnings before effect of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented here because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to service and/or incur indebtedness. However, EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or as a measure of a company's profitability or liquidity. The Company's measure of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
