Japan's Nikkei was down 0.3 percent.On Wall Street, U.S. stocks ended flat on Tuesday. A weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales report dented the dollar only slightly and the S&P 500 managed to eke out its tenth record closing high of the year after the release, as the figures did little to change views the economy was poised for faster growth this quarter.  "The lack of a reaction to such a critical report has to do with the belief that the slowdown in spending will not distract the central bank from its plans to taper asset purchases by $10 billion at each successive meeting," Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, wrote in a note to clients.The retail sales report does help explain why the Federal Reserve has not set a clear time frame for its first interest rate hike, she added. By contrast, the likelihood of easing action increased in the euro zone.
