Support: 0.8859 (61.8% Fib exp.), 0.8829 (50% Fib exp.)
Resistance: 0.8896-0.8914 (76.4% Fib exp., Apr 4 close), 0.8956 (100% Fib exp.) The US Dollar continues to push higher against the Swiss Franc having reversed upward as expected after producing a bullish Piercing Line candlestick pattern. Prices are testing resistance in the 0.8896-0.8914 area, marked by the April 4 close and the 76.4% Fibonacci expansion at 0.8896. A break above that on a daily closing basis targets the 100% level at 0.8956. Alternatively, a drop back below the 61.8% Fib at 0.8859 exposes the 50% expansion at 0.8829.Prices are too close to relevant resistance to justify a long position at current levels from a risk/reward perspective. We will stand aside for now, looking for a break above resistance to yield a buying opportunity.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
