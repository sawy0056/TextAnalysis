Support:1.6820 (23.6% Fib ret.), 1.6711-41 (trend line, 38.2% Fib ret.)
Resistance: 1.6952 (trend line), 1.6996 (May 6 high) The British Pound moved sharply lower against the US Dollar having found resistance below the 1.70 figure. Near-term support is at 1.6820, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement. A break downward on a daily closing basis exposes a rising trend line set from early February, now at 1.6741, followed by the 38.2% level at 1.6711. Trend line support-turned-resistance is at 1.6952, with a rebound above that targeting the May 6 high at 1.6996.Risk/reward considerations argue against entering short with prices sitting squarely at relevant support. On the other hand, taking up the long side looks premature without a defined bullish reversal signal. We will remain flat for now, waiting for an actionable opportunity to emerge.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
