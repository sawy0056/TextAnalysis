Support: 1.3673-86 (61.8% Fib exp., wedge floor), 1.3598 (76.4% Fib exp.)
Resistance: 1.3734 (50% Fib exp.), 1.3795 (38.2% Fib exp.) The Euro continued to sink for a fifth consecutive day having produced a double top below the 1.40 figure against the US Dollar. Support is now in the 1.3673-86 area, marked by the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement and the bottom of a rising wedge chart formation in play since late last year. A break downward on a daily closing basis exposes the 76.4% level at 1.3598. Alternatively, a reversal back above the 50% Fib at 1.3734 targets the 38.2% retracement at 1.3795.We are looking to enter short in line with long-term fundamental outlook but the pair is too close to relevant support to justify a trade from a risk/reward perspective. We will remain flat for now.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
