1st Nationwide Mortgage a leading Southern California lender, will start offering home loans backed by the government such as FHA and VA to consumers in Colorado and Texas.View photosAliso Viejo, USA / ACCESSWIRE / May 14th, 2014 / One of southern California’s preferred residential lenders has expanded their coverage to include the sates of Colorado and Texas. 1st Nationwide Mortgage is a leading lender for people with average to marginal credit which includes first time home buyers as well as buyers seeking to purchase a bigger home.According to DataQuick, a real estate information provider, the median price home buyers paid for a home in California in March was $376,000, which is up 20.1 percent from $313,000 in March 2013.“With FHA and VA loan limits in Southern California well above the median sales price, home buyers are still able to get into a home with just 3.5% down or zero down on a VA loan,” says Chris Arco, President of 1st Nationwide Mortgage.1st Nationwide’s website allows consumers to get matched to a loan program of their choosing and to a local licensed mortgage originator in their area who can get them approved. People are getting approved who previously thought they were not eligible because their credit score was 620 or less.Stemming from home prices rising steadily in many areas, eligible members of the military in high-cost communities, such as Orange County, CA for example, could very well apply for and be approved for a VA jumbo home loan. The Veterans Administration (VA) is fully committed to these prices until the end of 2014, except in cases where the FHFA reports a decrease in the loan limits.To obtain home loan approval, whether it be for an FHA, VA, conforming or jumbo, prospective borrowers should visit their website and fill out an application. Only two minutes of time, if that, is required to begin. If the borrower’s financing request is acceptable, they can expect a call from a licensed originator to explain the process in more detail and request specific documents.About 1st Nationwide Mortgage:1st Nationwide Mortgage specializes in residential home loans for first-time home buyers, and refinance homeowners under the HARP program.
