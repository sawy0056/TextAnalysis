Chance (08:32) looking for a rotational day – leaning more to buying pullbacks off the 1886.75-1889.25 zone and 82-84 below that. Scaling longs 1899.5-1901.5 – above there 1906.75-1908.75 comes into play where I expect buying to be exhausted. O/N range very tight – so anticipating that type of trade for RTH’s. william_blount (08:33) 1891.5, 98.5, 1901.5, 1908.5, 1915.5 = le SPOTS. william_blount (08:43) gimme my 12 cents – [SPX] 1900

Tyra (09:16) ty, Chance, re the tick… had not thought about it that way until you said … william_blount (09:20) bears better show UP. Barry (09:26) I’m not going to read too much into a quarter percent drop in [IWM] after yesterday’s big move but if it starts to accelerate beyond here it’ll have my attention. Chance (09:45) good volume just came out 1898.25. 1898.50 marked the new all-time high … Sam (10:05) this run up. one of the longest i have seen in recent memory with pit deviation. has been riding right against it for 1.3 million contracts currently it will have to touch 1888 to relieve that pressure but that number is rising.

The futures traded 1893.70 on the cash close before settling at 1894.30, up 1.5 handles on volume of 1.07M e-minis, while the [VIX] was down fractionally. Sam (14:54) nothing much accomplished either way today, bulls or bears. if anything a 3 uu on this leg with a possible 4 down that can get as low as 1885 – bulls in charge – and if u see 85 and it holds it aint bearish … and my good friend mr blount would agree if this is a flat 4 and this is all she has watch out above.Eco calendars: http://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/     http://www.dailyfx.com/calendarPosted last Friday:  Folks tend to focus only on the AAII Sentiment bull/bear spread, but I also keep an eye on neutral sentiment – think of it as a measure of the “dry powder” that will eventually go back into the market. Over the course of the last nine weeks, neutral sentiment has risen from a z-score of +0.1 (basically the mean), to +1.3 in the current week. For perspective, this week’s reading of 43% is the highest since February 2003. Implications of high neutral sentiment are bullish with above-average gains and positive expected forward performance across 1-mo, 3-mo, 6-mo and 12-mo timeframes – Oh, and dont forget … The Pitbull’s thurs/Fri low before opex – Cyrus.
