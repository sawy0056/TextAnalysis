Support:1.6751 (23.6% Fib ret.), 1.6695 (38.2% Fib ret.)
Resistance: 1.6822 (Feb 17 high)
The British Pound may be in the process of setting a double top against the US Dollar after prices produced a Shooting Star candlestick below resistance at 1.6822, the February 17 high. Negative RSI divergence bolsters the case for a downside scenario. Near-term support is at 1.6751, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, with a break below that on a daily closing basis targeting the 38.2% level at 1.6695. We sold GBP/USD at 1.6789, setting a stop-loss to be triggered on a daily close above 1.6822. Profit on half of the position will be booked and the stop-loss trailed to breakeven at 1.6751. The remainder of the trade will be left to develop with subsequent downside momentum.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
