Witherspoon, 37, continued. The officer answered by saying, "No, I don't need to know your name." The usually squeaky clean mother of three then came back with, "You're about to find out who I am ... You are going to be on national news."At one point, the "Legally Blonde" actress reportedly got out of her car and the officer ordered her back inside. When she got out a second time, he arrested her for disorderly conduct.The couple — who wed in 2011 and recently had a baby — were both taken to jail, booked, and released a short time later. Witherspoon was in Atlanta shooting the indie drama “The Good Lie.” Production on the film was not interrupted by the arrests, according to Variety sources.More From Business Insider 11 Celebrities Who Are Outspoken About Their Love Of WeedCiara Reignites Feud With Rihanna: 'She's Nuts Right Now'Justin Bieber Posts Cartoon Of Himself In Bed With A Fan — Here's Today's Buzz
