FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeraete, a joint venture of Siemens (GER:SIE) and Robert Bosch (ROBG.UL), on Saturday denied a magazine article saying the recall of 5 million dishwashers would cost it up to 700 million euros ($921 million)."This figure lacks any foundation and is plucked out of the air," a spokesman for BSH said, responding to an article in German magazine Focus that had reported the number, saying it had been mentioned by a company manager at an internal meeting.The spokesman declined to say how much the recall would cost the group.On Thursday, BSH said it would recall 5 million dishwashers worldwide, having discovered that a faulty electrical part poses a fire hazard.There have for several years been problems with the dishwashers, branded Bosch, Siemens, Neff, Constructa and Junker+Ruh, but they had previously been assumed to be caused by problems related to local power grids, BSH said.(Reporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)
