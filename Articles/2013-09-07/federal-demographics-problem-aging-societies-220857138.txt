"All else being equal, an increase in the old-age dependency ratio of one point lowers (in absolute terms) the cumulative impact of a monetary policy shock on inflation and unemployment by 0.10 percentage points and 0.35 percentage points, respectively."In other words, as the old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of those in the population 65 and older to those between 15 and 64 years of age) rises, a change in policy rates by the central bank has less and less of an effect on unemployment and inflation rates."These estimates thus imply, when taken at face value, quite a strong negative long-run effect of the ageing of the population on the  effectiveness of monetary policy," says Imam. "This is particularly significant when linked to, for instance, the projected 10 point rise in the old-age dependency ratio in Germany over the next decade."This leads the IMF economist to a few conclusions, two of which we highlight here (emphasis added):More aggressive monetary policy needed: If monetary policy is less effective in a graying society, ceteris paribus, a larger change in the policy rate will be needed to bring about a change in the economy than in a younger society. This implies that traditional changes of 25 [basis points], which have been the norm in previous decades, may have to be amplified. Monetary policy will have to become more "activist" in ageing societies, with higher variation in interest rates possible going forward.Increasing importance of other policy tools to stabilize the economy: Monetary policy is a key tool of policymakers to stabilize the economy, and has proven to be a powerful weapon during the global crisis. If graying societies are a reason for monetary effectiveness becoming less potent, the burden to stabilize the economy and the financial system may increasingly be borne by other policy tools. With monetary policy effectiveness marginally reduced, the relative role of fiscal and macroprudential policy as a means to stabilize the economy may become more important.
