They own Telco, a holding company that controls 22 percent of Telecom.Story continuesOn Saturday, Generali Chairman Gabriele Galateri told Reuters that the insurer would need to sell its Telco stake in the absence of a convincing plan for Telecom Italia.On the possible impact of political turmoil in Egypt on Intesa's local unit Bank of Alexandria, Cucchiani said: "It is evident that there is an impact but so far (our unit) has been profitable."(Additional reporting by Gianluca Semeraro and Valentina Za, writing by Valentina Za, editing by Jennifer Clark/John Stonestreet)
