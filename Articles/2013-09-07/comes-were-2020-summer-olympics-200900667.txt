Madrid went out in the first round of voting, and another round was held as no candidate had secured the required majority. The Spanish capital had touted the fact that 80% of its venues were already ready and only $1.9 billion was needed for construction, but concerns about the Spanish economy may well have hampered its bid.Istanbul was considered a wild card choice by many, not just because of its large budget but also because of violent anti-government protests in the city earlier this year and a doping scandal among Turkish athletes.It will be the third time Tokyo has hosted the games, having previously hosted in 1940 and 1964. Neither Istanbul nor Madrid have hosted before.The 2012 Summer Games were held in London, U.K., while the 2016 Summer Games are due to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.More From Business Insider The Biggest Myth Of The Syrian War Is That The Rebels Are Dominated By al QaedaTesla Bulls Are Furious About An NYU Finance Professor's Blog PostUsain Bolt Will Retire After The 2016 Olympics
