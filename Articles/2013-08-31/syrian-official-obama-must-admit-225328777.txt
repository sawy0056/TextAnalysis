He must admit the victory of Syria,"  Sheikh Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun, the Grand Mufti of Syria (the highest religious law official), told YNetNews, adding that Syria was winning  "thanks to its leader, its people and its army, and this proved that the issue is not one of ethnic groups, but of homeland, which does not to yield to anyone except Allah."In his speech, Obama said he was "ready to act," and challenged Congress to follow his lead. He maintained that he does not need to seek congressional approval to strike, citing the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons that killed approximately 1,400 of its own people."We lead with the belief that right makes might. Not the other way around," Obama said. " Now's the time to show the world that America keeps our commitments."While many in Congress commended the president for allowing the issue to be debated, the Syrian Deputy Prime Minister told YNetNews  it was "t he Syrian army's readiness [that] warded off U.S. aggression against Syria."Although it's possible that Congress could be pulled back early, it's more likely that military action against Syria will come up for a vote the week of September 9th.More From Business Insider Obama's Approval Rating Plummets To Its Lowest Point Ever, And Syria Is To BlameThe Obama Administration Isn't Answering The Most Important Question About Attacking SyriaPUTIN: It's 'Utter Nonesense' For The Syrian Government To Use Chemical Weapons
