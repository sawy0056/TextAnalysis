Goldman Sachs declined comment as well. The other banks were not immediately available for comment.Under the terms of the deal, Verizon Communications will buy Vodafone's U.S. holding company, Vodafone Americas, that owns the Verizon Wireless stake and some other assets, the sources said.Verizon will then keep the Verizon Wireless stake and sell European assets back to Vodafone, in a move that is expected to reduce Vodafone's tax bill to around $5 billion, the sources said.The deal marks the third-largest acquisition announcement in corporate history and British telecom giant Vodafone's exit from the large but mature U.S. market.(Reporting by Soyoung Kim and Michelle Sierra; additional reporting by Nicola Leske.; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Sandra Maler)
