(Not bad for someone who was originally supposed to be killed off at the end of season one.)That puts Cranston's salary for the final eight episodes of the series at $1.8 million. Paul would take home $1.2 million.For a comparison, Cranston is making as much as what each of the "How I Met Your Mother" cast members earns ($225,000) and nearly as much as Damian Lewis on Showtime's "Homeland" ($250,000).Paul is earning as much as Peter Dinklage earns for his role on HBO's "Game of Thrones" per episode and more than that of "Elementary" star Lucy Liu ($130,000).In total, season 5 has 16 episodes. Provided Cranston and Paul's salary information is the same for the first eight episodes, that would put Cranston at $3.6 million for the entire final season of "Breaking Bad" while his co-star Paul would make a total of $2.4 million.More From Business Insider 'Breaking Bad' Actress Anna Gunn Explains Why Fans Hate Her Character, SkylerThe 5 Most Intense Moments From This Week's Episode Of 'Breaking Bad'Here's The Preview For Next Week's 'Breaking Bad' Episode You're Looking For
