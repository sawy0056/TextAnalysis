Weiss explained in a detailed piece about degrading Assad.And a detailed report by Chris Harmer of the Institute of the Study of War notes that only 100 Syrian Air Force fixed-wing planes are operable because all but six of the 27 airbases in Syria are either rebel controlled or fiercely contested.So, even though the Obama administration hasn't explicitly explained how a limited strike would reduce suffering in Syria, that information is important to the upcoming Congressional debate over a military strike.View photosScreen Shot 2013 08 31 at 2.24.17 PMMoreBusiness InsiderMore From Business Insider Why Obama Is Still Committed To Attacking Syria Despite Waning SupportKey Parts Of The Declassified US Report On The Chemical Weapons Attack In SyriaIAN BREMMER: The US Has To Attack Syria
