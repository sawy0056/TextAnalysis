SAP co-ceo bill mcdermott on oracleMoreBusiness InsiderSAP co-CEO Bill McDermott took the plunge and joined Twitter this week and he's taking to social networking like an old pro.His first tweet was a cheerful hello that expertly included the #SAP hashtag. And that made his second tweet hilarious.Apparently, SAP employees found him and he was inundated, not with tweets, but with emails welcoming him to Twitter and alerting him of followers. He saw his inbox fill up and thought there was some sort of catastrophe in the company.@pixelbase Hope you tolerate me, too! Had 350 emails by 6am; wondered if biz issue but happy to see warm welcome from friends. Thx all!— Bill McDermott (@BillRMcDermott) August 27, 2013With that second tweet and a total of seven this week, he also instantly out-tweeted archrival Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, who joined Twitter in June, 2012, and has since sent only one. And that was a dis of SAP.McDermott's tweets have been far friendlier, including a shout-out to Fantasy Football and Martin Luther King Jr.Ellison managed to attract 40,000 follows to his single tweet. Ellison admits that Facebook is more his style. (His Facebook profile is not public).In a few days, McDermott has attracted about 1,000 followers, so he still has a ways to go to beat Ellison on that count, but if he keeps up the action, he surely will.More From Business Insider Security Researchers Prove That Dropbox Can Be HackedNow Oracle Has Stolen A Top Sales Exec From Salesforce.comThis Guy's Startup Helps Down-And-Out High School Teams Win Games
