However, no foreign companies are allowed to issue shares on Chinese bourses.Speaking to reporters at the sidelines of the parliament session in Beijing, Gui said the exchange was preparing a team to study ways to develop the trading platform.China opened the Shanghai free-trade zone in late September to fuel development of the country's financial-services sector.Beijing has said that it would allow a trial of a fully convertible yuan capital account in the free-trade zone, sparking hopes for an easing of controls that bar foreign companies from raising capital through IPOs.(Reporting by Zhang Xiaochong and Fayen Wong; Editing by Kim Coghill)
