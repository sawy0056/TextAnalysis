The company says employees will be called back to work Saturday.The plant closed Jan. 8 when inspectors found the cockroaches on five separate occasions in various parts of the plant over four months. The closure came three months after inspectors threatened a shutdown because of salmonella problems at the Livingston plant and two Foster Farms sites in Fresno.
