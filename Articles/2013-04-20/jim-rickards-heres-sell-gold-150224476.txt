We're going to have an investment-driven model rather than a debt and consumption-driven model, and we're going to have positive real rates."I would say, "Great. Sell your gold, or put it to one side, because gold is over."But none of those things are true. Not one of those policies that I just mentioned is on the table.In fact, the opposite is true. We're getting higher taxes, more regulation, more quantitative easing, zero interest rates as far as the eye can see.For their part, Société Générale analysts wrote in a report published Friday, " After the yen, we are seeing the demise of gold, another asset that had performed very strongly through the financial crisis. What’s next? Treasuries, we think, but only when the U.S. economy picks up again this summer and the Fed exit talk heats up."More From Business Insider JIM RICKARDS: Here's The Difference Between 'Paper' Gold And 'Physical' GoldNo One Can Call Gold A Safe Haven Ever AgainGOLD SINKS TO NEW LOW: $1,322
