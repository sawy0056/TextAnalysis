VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jun 3, 2013) -
Cayden Resources Inc. (TSX VENTURE:CYD) ("Cayden" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has received additional results from ongoing trenching programs at its El Barqueño property located in Jalisco State, Mexico. Highlights include: 21 meters of 8.3 g/t Au, including 4 meters of 20.3 g/t Au; 54 meters of 1.1 g/t Au; and 13 meters of 2.4 g/t Au.The trenches were taken from the Azteca target area where two parallel fault zones contained abundant vein and stockwork-controlled mineralization. The Azteca target area is one of the many areas on the property where wide zones of hydrothermal alteration and networked quartz veins occur at surface. The strike length of mineralization revealed by the assayed trenches is 1.4 kilometers and the system is open in both directions. Assay results continue to reveal that gold occurs in the veins and wall rock, indicating the strong potential for a bulk mineable epithermal deposit.

Geological mapping and sampling programs are underway in several other target areas on the property where the same type of hydrothermal alteration and networked quartz veins occur at surface. Cayden plans to commence an initial 25-hole diamond drill program this summer at the Azteca target area.Ivan Bebek, President and CEO commented, "These trench results are very impressive as they continue to indicate strength and continuity of the gold system in one of several target areas that we are exploring. We feel that the El Barqueño property represents a significant opportunity for the discovery of a district scale, bulk mineable gold system."David Hladky, P. Geo. is the Qualified Person with respect to NI 43-101 at El Barqueño. All trench intercepts were obtained from continuous channel sampling at one-meter intervals, primarily through excavated trenches. As the mapped mineralized corridors strike EW to ENE, trenches were designed to intersect the mineralization as close to perpendicular as possible. It is believed that the trench intercepts represent 70-100 percent of the true width. Intercepts were calculated assuming a bulk-mining scenario, with a width cutoff of five meters and grade cutoff of 0.5 g/t Au. The wider intercepts have, at maximum, five consecutive meters less than 0.2 g/t at which time two intercepts were composited. Any samples greater than 10 g/t Au are noted in the intercept table.All samples are assayed using standard 30 gram fire assay with atomic absorption finish by Acme Labs in Vancouver, Ca. QA/QC programs using internal standard samples, field and lab duplicates, re-assays, and blanks indicate good accuracy and precision in a large majority of standards assayed.On Behalf of the Board, Ivan Bebek, President and CEOAbout Cayden Resources - Cayden is a junior mining company focused on delivering shareholder value through the acquisition, exploration and development of precious metal projects in Mexico.
