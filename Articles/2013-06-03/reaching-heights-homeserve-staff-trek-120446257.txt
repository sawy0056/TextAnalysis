WALSALL, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - Jun 3, 2013) -Editors' Note: There is a photo associated with this press release.An intrepid team of 75 volunteers from HomeServe's Walsall, Preston and Banbury sites took supporting a charity to new heights on Friday (24 May), as they trekked over 1,000 metres to the summit of Mount Snowdon to raise money for national charity partner Marie Curie Cancer Care.The feat raised more than £15,000 for the charity, with the Walsall, Preston and Banbury teams forming part of a larger HomeServe expedition of 75 employees from across the UK, including UK Chief Executive Officer Jonathan King, Group Chief Operating Officer Martin Bennett, Service Operations Director Steve Herbert and Affinity Partnerships Director David Graham. All the funds raised will help Marie Curie Nurses provide more free care to people with terminal illnesses in their own homes and in the charity's hospices.The volunteers, who were given an extra day's leave to take part, took on average six hours to climb 1,085 metres (3,500 feet) to the top of Snowdon, the highest peak in England and Wales, and then descend - a round trip of more than 10 miles in some of the UK's toughest walking terrain.The feat of reaching the summit was captured with a group photo of the party in special event bobble hats. During the evening victory dinner Marie Curie Nurse Mary Williams thanked HomeServe employees for their support and memory candles were lit in celebration of loved ones lost to terminal illnesses. Jonathan King also presented his King of the Mountain trophy to the largest single fundraiser, Joanne Biisterbosch, from the HomeServe Preston office, who raised a staggering £1,885.12 and has a very personal reason for getting involved, as her father has cancer.HomeServe Memberships CEO Jonathan King said: "I continue to be amazed by the dedication and determination shown by everyone at HomeServe in supporting Marie Curie Cancer Care. It's not just big, fund-raising challenges like this or last summer's cycle challenge; staff help in hundreds of ways, large and small, from Wear Yellow to Work Days to just donating their spare change, which together have a massive impact. We've extended our partnership for another year and want to raise even more for this excellent cause."Fabian French, Director of Fundraising at Marie Curie Cancer Care, said: "We'd like to send our sincere thanks to the team at HomeServe for the effort and determination they showed in reaching Snowdon's summit. Through this challenge and their fantastic continued support they have raised considerable funds which will make a very significant difference, helping Marie Curie Nurses to provide many more hours of care to terminally ill people and support for their families."Having originally pledged to donate £1 million over the course of three years, HomeServe smashed that target last September and has now donated more than £1.35 million since adopting Marie Curie as its national charity partner in 2010. That includes £540,000 in cash donations - enough to fund the equivalent of 28 Marie Curie Nurses for a year - and more than £800,000 via its free Patient Policy, which gives Marie Curie patients and their families peace of mind with free help for home emergencies.The company has extended its partnership until March 2014 and for the fourth consecutive year will sponsor Marie Curie's Walk Ten events this summer. Walk Ten is a series of twilight 10k walks held throughout the UK to raise money for local Marie Curie Nurses, followed by fire displays and live entertainment..About HomeServe With over 2,700 directly employed and sub-contracted engineers, Homeserve is a national emergency home repair service backed by a 24 hour claims handling and repair network.HomeServe's new tradesmen service provides households with access vetted tradesmen who are qualified to carry out hundreds of different jobs around the home.Homeserve also offers insurance cover for plumbing, drains, electrical wiring and gas central heating.About Marie Curie Cancer Care Marie Curie Cancer Care is one of the UK's largest charities. Employing more than 2,700 nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals, it provided care to more than 35,000 terminally ill patients in the community and in its nine hospices last year and is the largest provider of hospice beds outside the NHS.Story continuesFunding Around 70 per cent of the charity's income comes from the generous support of thousands of individuals, membership organisations and businesses, with the balance of our funds coming from the NHS.Marie Curie Nurses The charity is best known for its network of Marie Curie Nurses working in the community to provide end of life care, totally free for patients in their own homes.The right to die in place of choice Research shows around 63 per cent of people would like to die at home if they had a terminal illness, with a sizeable minority opting for hospice care. However, more than 50 per cent of cancer deaths still occur in hospital, the place people say they would least like to be. Since 2004 Marie Curie Cancer Care has been campaigning for more patients to be able to make the choice to be cared for and die in their place of choice.To view the photo associated with this press release, please visit the following link: http://www.marketwire.com/library/20130603-HomeServe_800.jpg
