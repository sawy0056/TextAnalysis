Children can be hurt if the sensor cannot determine who is sitting in the seat.Scroll to continue with contentAdThe letter said the sensor mat installed in the front passenger seat may fail because of repeated flexing. During a crash, the air bag will deploy regardless of whether the person is an adult or a child.There have been no reports of accidents or injuries. Suzuki will notify owners starting in October and dealers will replace mats for free, the letter said.(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Philip Barbara)
