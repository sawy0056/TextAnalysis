He was shown on state television in August after being detained on an accusation of visiting prostitutes.Police are now investigating reports from Internet users that Xue's online activities may have involved crimes, Xinhua said.Several foreign and Chinese executives, detained for various reasons, have made confessions recently on state television leading to worry in the business community about a trend that some lawyers say makes a mockery of due process.Confessions have long been part of China's legal landscape but rarely have senior business figures been put on television in prison jumpsuits to confess.(Reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Robert Birsel)
