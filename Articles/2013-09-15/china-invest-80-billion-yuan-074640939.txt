Much of it comes from the Middle East and Africa and is transported via vulnerable sea lanes.Gas imports are important to China because domestic production is not sufficient to meet growing demand. Imported gas is delivered via pipeline from Central Asia and by ship from countries such as Australia, Indonesia and Qatar.China bought 42.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas from overseas last year. That was up more than 30 percent compared with 2011 and a nearly 10-fold increase from 2007.(Reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Robert Birsel)
