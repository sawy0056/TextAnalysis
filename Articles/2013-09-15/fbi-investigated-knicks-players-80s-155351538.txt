Most of those bets were reportedly successful.The informant said that the unnamed dealer was receiving “inside player information not known to the general public,” such as key players sitting out, from unnamed Knicks players during the 1981-82 season.Tuohy writes that Knicks players even began betting against themselves.From the FBI documents (via "Larceny Games"):“Source further stated that at this point, he believes that the players must be betting against the Knicks to lose. … Source observed heavy betting by [redacted] toward the latter part of the NY Knicks season, on the Knicks to lose certain games. In each case, the Knicks did lose, or failed to cover the point spread on the game.”Golliver notes that the 1981-82 Knicks finished with a 33-49 record, losing eight of their final nine games.Tuohy notes that the FBI's investigation continued for years but charges never materialized because of a lack of confessions and physical evidence.The Post caught up with the team’s leading scorer, Micheal "Sugar" Ray Richardson, who was banned for life in 1986 for violating the league’s substance abuse policy after struggling with  a cocaine addiction .When asked about the point-shaving allegations, t he four-time NBA All-Star told the Post: “Hell no! We never did anything like that.”Check out the book >More From Business Insider The Shocking Case Of A Mother And Father Who Planned Their Children's Sex Abuse Before They Were Even BornNFL WEEK 2: Here Are Our Official Predictions For Who Wins This WeekendHere's A Mind-Melting GIF That Shows How Apple's iPhone Software Is Changing This Year
