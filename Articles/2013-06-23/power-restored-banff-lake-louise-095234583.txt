CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Jun 23, 2013) -
Following overnight repairs to a damaged transformer at TransAlta's Cascade hydro power facility in Banff National Park, power to the towns of Banff and Lake Louise was restored at 2:45 a.m. this morning.On June 22, water that needed to be released from the Cascade facility backed up along the Trans-Canada Highway adjacent to the facility and flowed over the highway, closing the highway between Banff and Canmore. This water also came into contact with a transformer at the facility, which failed, creating a loud noise heard by some in the area. The transformer failure cut power from the facility to Banff and Lake Louise. At no time was the integrity of the Cascade facility affected.Initial response efforts focused on reducing the levels of the backed up water around the transformer, in order to allow safe access for workers to begin repairs.Hugo Shaw, Executive Vice-president of Operations at TransAlta says "we were able to complete the repairs safely due to the hard work and diligence of the TransAlta operating team, CP Rail, Fortis and Altalink."Any additional updates will be made available on TransAlta's website at www.transalta.com/newsroom and via the company's Twitter account (www.Twitter.com/TransAlta) and Facebook page (www.Facebook.com/TransAlta).TransAlta is a power generation and wholesale marketing company focused on creating long-term shareholder value.
