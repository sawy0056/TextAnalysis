OTTAWA, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Jun 23, 2013) -
The Honourable Vic Toews, Minister of Public Safety, made the following statement to mark the twenty-eighth anniversary of the bombing of Air India Flight 182 and on Canada's National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism:"Today, I encourage all Canadians to take time to reflect on the lives of those who have been lost around the world to acts of terrorism. The bombing of Air India Flight 182 twenty eight years ago was a terrible act that changed the way Canadians understand the threat of terrorism. Although we as Canadians rarely have to face this brutal reality, recent terrorist events and arrests demonstrate that terrorism poses a real threat to Canada and remains a global problem.Our government remains committed to keeping our streets and communities safe by providing law enforcement with the tools they require and protecting this country from the reach of terrorists. We place the utmost priority on preventing, countering and prosecuting terrorism. The best way to honour the memories of the victims of Air India Flight 182 is to remain vigilant and work to ensure such a heinous act is never repeated."In 2011, Prime Minister Harper announced a commitment of $10 million over five years to the Kanishka Project, named after Air India Flight 182 as a way to honour the memory of the victims. Research supported by the project will increase understanding of the recruitment methods and tactics of terrorists, as well as the needs of communities affected by terrorism, which will help produce more effective policies, tools and resources for law enforcement and people on the front lines.Canada's Counter-terrorism Strategy sets out how the Government as a whole organizes its efforts to prevent, detect, deny and respond to the threat of terrorism. The success of the Strategy relies on strong partnerships with the public, academia, law enforcement, all levels of government and international partners. The Strategy also commits to keeping Canadians informed of the evolving terrorist threat environment, which was recently addressed by the Government's 2013 Public Report on the Terrorist Threat to Canada.For more information on Building Resilience Against Terrorism: Canada's Counter-terrorism Strategy, the 2013 Public Report on the Terrorist Threat to Canada or the Kanishka Project please visit the Public Safety Canada website at www.publicsafety.gc.ca.Follow Public Safety Canada (@Safety_Canada) on Twitter.
