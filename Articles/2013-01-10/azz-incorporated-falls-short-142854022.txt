Electrical equipment manufacturer AZZ Incorporated (AZZ) posted earnings per share of 60 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, a penny short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
However, the quarterly results were 53.8% higher than 39 cents reported in the year-ago comparable period. The higher year-over-year contribution from Electrical and Industrial Products and Galvanizing Service segments benefited the results.
Total Revenue
Total revenue shot up 28.5% year over year to $149.7 million from $119.5 million. Better performance from its organic assets and contribution from its acquired assets resulted in the better year-over-year results.
Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $160 million.

Cost of sales, as a percentage of revenue, contracted 362 basis points year over year to aid margin. Operating income grew 37.4% to $33.4 million.
The backlog of the company at the end of the quarter was $215.8 million, up substantially from $132.1 million reported a year ago. AZZ Incorporated benefited from the acquired backlog of Nuclear Logistics Incorporated, which came under its umbrella in June 2012.
The order booking of $152.4 million was also higher than $125.4 million booked in the comparable prior-year period. Overseas orders constituted 29% of the backlog, which is an encouraging sign for the company.
Interest expenses dropped to $3.2 million from $3.5 million, indicating a reduction in the debt level of the company.

Our Take
Even though the company failed to match our estimates, we believe that the strong backlog will definitely help the company post better results in the forthcoming quarters. Besides, the three strategic acquisitions made by the company during the first nine months of the fiscal year will also help the company to report better results in the forthcoming quarters.
