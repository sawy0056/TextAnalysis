Crude oil and gold prices may find fuel to continue higher as a dovish turn at the ECB buoys risk appetite and weighs on haven demand for the US Dollar.Talking Points Crude Oil, Copper May Rise with Stocks if ECB Rate Decision Yields Stimulus Clues
Gold and Silver to Find De-Facto Support in Risk Appetite as US Dollar Turns Lower Commodities are on the upswing in the wake of dramatically better-than-expected Chinese export figures. December’s report showed overseas sales rose 14.1 percent year-on-year, nearly tripling forecasts calling for a 5 percent increase and buoying global recovery bets. The risk-on mood may get a further boost from the ECB interest rate decision. Leading indicators suggest Eurozone GDP probably shrank again in the fourth quarter while inflation is at a two-year low. Meanwhile, periphery bond yields have dropped since the unveiling of the OMT program mid last year, reflecting ebbing sovereign risk premiums and normalization of policy transmission. This seems to create an environment that both calls for and is able to support monetary stimulus. With that in mind, clues about forthcoming accommodation that emerge in ECB President Mario Draghi’s press conference following the rate announcement may prove supportive for overall risk appetite. After all, aside from uncertainty about looming US austerity, the recession in the Euro area is the most critical headwind for global performance at large. S&P 500 index futures are pointing firmly higher, hinting sentiment is positioned to improve further. This points to continued gains for cycle-sensitive crude oil and copper prices. Meanwhile, anti-fiat gold and silver stand to find de-facto support as swelling risk appetite dents haven demand for the US Dollar.WTI Crude Oil (NY Close): $93.10 // -0.05 // -0.05%Prices are testing above resistance at 93.25, the 100% Fibonacci expansion.
