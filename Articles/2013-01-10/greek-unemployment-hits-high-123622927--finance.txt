In return, the government has imposed strict austerity measures that have slashed salaries, increased taxes and plunged the country into a recession. Tens of thousands of businesses have shut down.On Thursday, meanwhile, Socialist lawmaker Christos Aidonis quit the seven-month-old coalition government and declared himself an independent, protesting at the lack of action taken to investigate people on a list of Greeks with Swiss banks accounts for potential tax fraud.His action reduces the number of lawmakers backing the government in the 300-member parliament to 163. It also means that continued support from all three parties in the coalition — the conservative New Democracy, Socialist PASOK and Democratic Left — is now required to keep the government afloat.Former Socialist Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou is facing a parliamentary investigation into his handling of the list of 2,000 Greeks who held accounts at HSBC bank in Switzerland until 2007. The list was drawn from data on 24,000 customers reportedly stolen from the bank.Prosecutors said the names of three of Papaconstantinou's relatives had been illegally removed from the list of Greek account holders.
