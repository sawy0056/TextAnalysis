Pattern since the 1/4 high suggests that weakness is probably a 4th wave. In other words, additional sideways trading is possible but another high (in wave 5 and probably to complete the cycle that began on 11/9) is the likely outcome before a deeper decline.FOREXTrading Strategy: If the USDJPY trades above 8842, then I’ll be on the lookout for signs of a top at 90. Aside from the obvious psychological implications, 8999 is the width of consolidation (8241-8683) added to the top. Consolidations can be used to identify measured moves.
