San Diego-based PriceSmart has been reaping the benefits of a shift in consumer preference. Consumers are shifting toward lower-priced brands and private-label merchandise sold by the company due to slow economic recovery, low employment level and reduced consumer spending. This business model helps PriceSmart to consistently generate strong sales, earn profits and offset low margins.
PriceSmart carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), whereas its competitor, Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO) carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
Volatile foreign exchange is a matter of concern, as the company has significant international presence.
