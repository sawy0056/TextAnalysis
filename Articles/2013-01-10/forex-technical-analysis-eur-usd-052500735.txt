In fact, the former resistance line extended off of the March, September, and October highs served as support last week. Structurally, the decline from 13307 may compose a flat.” Near term, confidence is low in the upside due to the 3 wave advance from Friday’s low but a run on 13154 or even 13225 isn’t out of the question as long as Friday’s low is intact.FOREX Trading Strategy: Conflicting evidence makes trading against Friday’s low or Tuesday’s high untenable. I’m sitting tight.
