Total sales however lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $377 million.Gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 39.6% due to improved product mix following the addition of the PUR filtration business. Operating margin also increased 30 basis points to 12.6%, driven by higher sales growth and relatively flat selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses.Segment DetailsHousewares:Sales in the Housewares category climbed 10.7% to $67.8 million compared with the previous year period, reflecting double-digit organic sales growth due to the addition of new products under the OXO brand.Personal Care:Sales in this category declined marginally by 0.2% to $148.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
