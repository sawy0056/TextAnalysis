And those roof parties, which won’t play any music, would stop serving alcohol about an hour before the final close, to make sure 11 p.m. and 10 p.m. are a “hard close.”“No one is going to stick around if alcohol isn’t being served,” Hemphill said. The latest events held inside would end by midnight, Hemphill added.Despite some continued concerns from surrounding residents, several neighbors praised Spring Studios for their extended outreach to the community.The company — which will take up four floors of the overhauled building, with several studios for photo shoots and digital editing, a 60-person theater and a gallery — had several long meetings with CB1 members and locals to hash out the details presented on Wednesday."They've really been more than reasonable with the community," said CB1 member Adam Malitz. "I think its time we get on with this," he added, echoing the sentiments of many in the room.CB1’s Tribeca Committee eventually voted 6 in favor of the advisory approval for a liquor license, with 2 opposed and 1 abstention.CB1's full board will vote on the license later this month, and then it will go to the State Liquor Authority for final approval.Also on DNAinfo.com...Scantily Clad Ladies Spice Up Shoe Shines at New Financial District ShopOccupy Wall Street Wins $350K for Damage During Zuccotti RaidManhattan DA Probed Pay-to-Play Scheme Involving Pols, Contractor ArrestedMore From Business Insider Tiger Woods Will NOT Be Disqualified From The Masters14-Year-Old Golfer Gives Classy Interview After Getting Screwed At The Masters14-Year-Old Masters Phenom Given A Ridiculous One-Stroke Penalty For Playing Too Slow
