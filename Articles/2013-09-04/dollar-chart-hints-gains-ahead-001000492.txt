Buyers now aim to challenge the 50% Fibonacci retracement at 10828, with a push beyond that aiming for the 61.8% level at 10870. Near-term support is at 10785, the 38.2% Fib, followed by the channel top (now recast as support at 10763).View photosForex_Dollar_Chart_Hints_at_Gains_Ahead_SPX_500_Breakout_Proves_False_body_Picture_5.png, Dollar Chart Hints at Gains Ahead, SPX 500 Breakout Proves FalseMoreDaily Chart - Created Using FXCM Marketscope 2.0** The Dow Jones FXCM US Dollar Index and the Mirror Trader USD basket are not the same product.S&P 500 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS – Yesterday’s upside reversal now appears to have been a false breakout, with prices tumbling back below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement (1646.20) into the support region bracketed by a pair of trend lines set from the November 2012. The lower support boundary is now at 1633.30, with a push beneath that eyeing the August 28 low at 1626.60. Alternatively, a move back above 1646.20 targets the upper trend line at 1649.50.View photosForex_Dollar_Chart_Hints_at_Gains_Ahead_SPX_500_Breakout_Proves_False_body_Picture_6.png, Dollar Chart Hints at Gains Ahead, SPX 500 Breakout Proves FalseMoreDaily Chart - Created Using FXCM Marketscope 2.0GOLD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS – Prices turned lower as expected, taking out support at the bottom of a rising channel set from early August to expose the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at 1373.79. A bounce from this support is seeing prices retest the channel bottom (1427.44) as resistance, with a break above that eyeing the August 28 high at 1433.61 anew. Alternatively, a reversal below 1373.79 targets the 38.2% level at 1336.79. On balance, the bounce appears corrective for now.View photosForex_Dollar_Chart_Hints_at_Gains_Ahead_SPX_500_Breakout_Proves_False_body_Picture_7.png, Dollar Chart Hints at Gains Ahead, SPX 500 Breakout Proves FalseMoreDaily Chart - Created Using FXCM Marketscope 2.0CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL ANALYSIS– Prices narrowly edged above resistance at 108.40, the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion.
