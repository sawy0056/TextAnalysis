Another 28 percent said they expect the inflation objective to be met.Japan's core consumer price rose 0.7 percent in July, ostensibly in line with the BOJ's policy objectives, data showed last week, though the rise was driven mostly by energy price hikes, not necessarily by stronger domestic demand.In the survey, 49 percent of the foundations expected Japan to step up stimulus as Abe's policies will not boost the economy as much as targeted, while 21 percent said the Japanese economy was on a sustainable recovery path.A small number of investors saw scenarios such as stagflation, a return to deflation and an all-out selling in Japanese assets due to mounting concerns on the country's dire fiscal conditions. Japan's debt is more than twice the size of its economy.It isn't clear how much of total investment in Japan is done by the foundations, as their activity is combined with households in the BOJ's flow of funds survey.While the exact size of investments by these foundations is hard to gauge, BOJ estimates put the total assets held by Japan's non-profit sector, which include schools and religious groups, at 48.9 trillion yen ($489 billion) as of March.About one-half of the respondents in the Mizuho survey have assets of more than 1 billion yen, and seven said they had more than 50 billion yen.(Reporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Richard Borsuk)
