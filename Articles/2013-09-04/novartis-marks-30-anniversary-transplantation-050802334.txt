Novartis reaffirms continued innovation in transplant during anniversary year of breakthrough therapy, ciclosporinTRANSFORM trial to be presented[1]: largest ever study of its kind, evaluating Certican® (everolimus) in more than 2,000 kidney transplant recipients, using innovative novel endpointBreadth of data reinforces efficacy and safety profile of Certican and ongoing commitment to improving transplant patients` lives in the long-termBasel, September 4, 2013 - Demonstrating the strength of its ongoing commitment to improve the lives of transplant patients through innovation, Novartis will present 24 abstracts from its portfolio of transplant therapies at the 16th congress of the European Society of Organ Transplantation (ESOT) in Vienna next week. In the year that marks the 30th anniversary of ciclosporin, Novartis will share its latest data addressing the long-term needs of transplant patients[1],[2]. This includes the innovative TRANSFORM study design, a landmark trial investigating long-term outcomes in kidney transplant recipients treated with Certican[1]."Having shaped the transplant landscape from the beginning with the discovery of ciclosporin 30 years ago, we remain committed to developing innovative solutions that advance the care of transplant patients," said Dr. Timothy Wright, Global Head Development, Novartis Pharmaceuticals.Novartis` discovery of the first calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), ciclosporin, was a watershed moment in the history of organ transplantation[3]. Following its approval 30 years ago, ciclosporin improved the one-year kidney graft survival rate from around 50% to more than 80%[4] and CNIs remain the most effective and widely used immunosuppressive agents in organ transplantation today[3].About Certican and the TRANSFORM study[1]The landmark TRANSFORM trial is an innovative long-term outcomes study with the potential to change the treatment paradigm for preventing rejection in de novo (first-time) kidney transplant recipients. For the transplant patient, it is no longer just about surviving; it is about living a long and fulfilling life thanks to improved outcomes (reduced risk of mortality and cardiovascular (CV) events, and improved quality of life).Novartis is committed to improving the lives of patients in the long-term through investment in innovative clinical trials like TRANSFORM, which it is hoped will be at the forefront of the next major evolutionary shift in transplantation.This global, Phase IV study, the largest ever in de novo kidney transplantation, is designed to evaluate the short- and long-term benefits of Certican plus low dose CNIs in kidney transplantation. The study of more than 2,000 patients will investigate de novo Certican + low dose CNI versus Mycophenolic Acid (MPA) + standard CNI, evaluating renal function and graft outcomes at 12- and 24- months, as well as long-term outcomes up to five years.The TRANSFORM trial is the first ever kidney transplantation study to evaluate the short- and long-term patient outcome benefits using an innovative and novel endpoint that combines renal function and graft outcome.  Novartis transplant portfolio highlights at ESOT, 8-11 September 2013Certican in kidney transplantThe HERAKLES study at 24 month: superior renal function in an everolimus-based CNI-free regimen.

Under the trade name Certican®, it is approved in more than 90 countries to prevent organ rejection for renal and heart transplant patients, and in addition, is approved in the EU and other countries worldwide to prevent organ rejection for liver transplant patients. In the U.S., under the trade name Zortress®, the drug is approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients at low-moderate immunologic risk receiving a kidney transplant, and is also approved in adult patients following a liver transplant.Everolimus is also available from Novartis in different dosage strengths and for different uses in non-transplant patient populations under the brand names Afinitor® and Votubia®. It is also exclusively licensed to Abbott and sublicensed to Boston Scientific for use in drug-eluting stents.Not all indications are available in every country. As an investigational compound, the safety and efficacy profile of everolimus has not yet been established outside the approved indications. Because of the uncertainty of clinical trials, there is no guarantee that everolimus will become commercially available for additional indications anywhere else in the world.Story continuesDisclaimerThe foregoing release contains forward-looking statements that can be identified by terminology such as "continued," "commitment," "ongoing," "will," "committed," "potential," "hope," "designed to," or similar expressions, or by express or implied discussions regarding potential new indications or labeling for everolimus or regarding potential future revenues from everolimus.
