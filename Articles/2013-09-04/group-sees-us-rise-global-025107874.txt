GENEVA (AP) -- An annual economic survey finds the United States' competitiveness rising again after four years of decline, in a turnaround that reflects a rebounding confidence in its financial market and politicians.The Geneva-based World Economic Forum says the world's largest economy saw its overall competitiveness rise to fifth place, up from seventh.Germany was at fourth place, up from sixth. In the lead on the top 10 board were Switzerland, No. 1, followed by Singapore, then Finland, all three unchanged from last year.Hong Kong moved up to seventh and Japan advanced to ninth. But Sweden dropped to sixth, while the Netherlands sank to eighth, and the U.K. moved down to 10th, reflecting what the Forum on Wednesday called a Europe distracted by public debt and concerns about the Eurozone's solidarity.
