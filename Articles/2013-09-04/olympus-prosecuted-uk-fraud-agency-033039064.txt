The shares later trimmed losses to end down 2.9 percent at 2,798 yen.Olympus said this would mark the first time the SFO had decided to prosecute a company, rather than an individual, for fraud, and that the lack of precedent made it unclear how long proceedings may take or what level of fines may be imposed. It added that court proceedings would begin this month.An Olympus spokesman said the firm was also still under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.Olympus bought Gyrus, a British medical equipment firm, for $2 billion in 2008. In addition to paying the world's largest M&A advisory fee, equivalent to one-third of the purchase price, Olympus later wrote down the value of the deal along with a handful of other acquisitions.The deal was part of a scheme to cover up investment losses dating back as much as a decade or more, which came to light when Olympus's British chief executive at the time, Michael Woodford, blew the whistle after being fired from the company for pressing for details on the investments.($1 = 99.8050 Japanese yen)(Editing by Chris Gallagher)
