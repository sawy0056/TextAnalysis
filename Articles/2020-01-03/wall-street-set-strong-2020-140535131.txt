The move to inject fresh stimulus into the Chinese economy boosted equity markets around the globe.The benchmark S&P 500 hit its 11th record high in 14 sessions and posted its largest daily percentage gain in three weeks. The Dow registered its biggest such gain in almost four weeks, and the Nasdaq its greatest in nearly three months.Economic stimulus in China, along with the easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, has bolstered optimism that the global economy will accelerate in 2020."The market's been up all day because of the news that China is out there with monetary easing," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
