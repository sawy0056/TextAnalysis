Others were damaged during protests on Christmas Eve.The two lions were daubed with graffiti and briefly set alight after being doused in a flammable liquid.HSBC said on Thursday initial cleaning of the lions had begun."We are engaging conservation experts to advise us on the professional restoration required and the process can take time," the bank said in a statement.'FINE LINE'More than 90% of the $4.4 billion generated by HSBC's retail banking and wealth management unit in the six months to last June, came from Hong Kong.HSBC has also deployed billions of dollars in China’s southern Pearl River Delta region, adjacent to Hong Kong, and has expanded its services in the world’s second largest economy.Some analysts believe HSBC executives will have to explain their Hong Kong strategy when they discuss annual results on Feb. 18.John Cronin, an analyst with Goodbody, said he expects to hear about a push to grow in other Asian nations, especially emerging markets, as unrest in Hong Kong continues."Even putting aside the political turmoil in Hong Kong, HSBC's dependence on Hong Kong for profitability is something I expect that management will seek to tackle," Cronin told Reuters.Beijing plans to integrate the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong and Macau to create an economic powerhouse under its Greater Bay Area Initiative.HSBC's entanglement in the protests underlines the tightrope that companies have had to walk since the protests got going in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.The demonstrations have evolved into a broad pro-democracy movement."Clearly, there is a fine line for management to draw between customers and the Chinese authorities,” said a head of corporate governance at a UK-based asset manager and HSBC shareholder.Other Hong Kong companies have been damaged by being perceived to be too supportive of the protests.Cathay Pacific Airways <0293.HK> was forced by Beijing to suspend staff involved in the protests, and chief executive Rupert Hogg and his top deputy resigned in August amid the turmoil.Story continuesHSBC has previously been targeted by supporters of Beijing.Users of China's Weibo social media platform shared screenshots last year of an HSBC employee's Facebook posts supporting the protests. The posts urged readers to complain to HSBC management."Businesses now have to consider how three different groups will react to their decisions: The Chinese government, Hong Kong protesters, and Chinese consumers," said Kent Kedl, head of Control Risks' Greater China practice.(Reporting by Alun John; Additional reporting by Simon Jessop and Lawrence White in London, and Jessie Pang and Mari Saito in Hong Kong; Editing by Jennifer Hughes, Robert Birsel and Grant McCool)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextStocks Tumble as Fear Envelops Asia; Yen Rises: Markets WrapBloombergUS, European stocks plunge, extending rout amid virus fearsAFPNew virus prompts Mormons to cancel key leadership eventAssociated PressPittsburgh companies implement travel restrictions in response to coronavirus threatsAmerican City Business JournalsCanada issues travel health notice for seven countries amid COVID-19 outbreakYahoo News CanadaRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
