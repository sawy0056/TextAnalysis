Here's why the food fight figures to continue in 2020Kevin Wheeler, USA TODAYUSA TODAYJanuary 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareIf 2019 could be summed up in a sandwich, it would be one made of fried chicken.That’s largely thanks to Popeyes, which released its highly-anticipated chicken sandwich in August that sparked the year's chicken sandwich war.The sandwich is a crispy fried chicken breast, topped with pickles, slicked with your choice of mayo or spicy Cajun sauce, and nestled on a brioche bun.And it has driven customers wild. The sandwich was so popular that Popeyes sold out nationally, some locations within days, and it didn’t come back until two months later, on Nov. 3, which, appropriately, was National Sandwich Day. The sandwich's return took a deadly turn the next day, when a fight broke out at a Maryland Popeyes, resulting in the stabbing death of a customer who had allegedly cut the line for one of the coveted sandwiches. New Year's Eve and New Year's Day hours: When Target, Best Buy, Walmart and others are openFreebie alert: Here's where to get free coffee, meal deals, drink specials on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s DayThe start of the chicken sandwich warA viral Twitter feud fueled the sandwich's popularity.It was a war whose weapons were sassy tweets. The spat began innocuously enough when Chick-fil-A tweeted "Bun + Chicken + Pickles = all the (heart emoji) for the original."Popeyes shot back at Chick-fil-A’s subtle dig, asking "... y’all good?" This tweet that set social media on fire has more than 320,000 likes.Wendy's, which is known for a Twitter account that relishes clapbacks and beefing with its competitors, soon entered the fray: "Y’all out here fighting about which of these fools has the second best chicken sandwich." Foods we know and love: The most iconic fast food items in AmericaWho's winning the war? Chick-fil-A is America's No. 1 fast-food restaurant again. Parents love it and hate itOther fast-food restaurants are getting into the mix now, too.Taco Bell recently began testing its Crispy Tortilla Chicken in Dayton, Ohio, and Houston. The Crispy Tortilla Chicken comes in marinated strips fried with a tortilla chip coating. Crispy Tortilla Chicken is expected to be at all Taco Bell locations in 2020. Not to be outdone by its rivals, KFC looked to another trend: plant-based meats. In August, KFC tested plant-based chicken strips, made in partnership with Beyond Meat, at one of its Atlanta restaurants. They sold out within five hours. McDonald's is testing a pair of new chicken sandwiches of its own in two Tennessee cities, a new Crispy Chicken Sandwich and a Deluxe Crispy Chicken Sandwich that better resemble the popular Popeyes and Chick-fil-A sandwiches.Americans’ desire for chicken may help drive future sandwich wars. Chicken consumption has been on the rise in the U.S. for decades.According to the National Chicken Council, in 2018, Americans ate 93.8 pounds of chicken per person. For 2020, that number is forecast to grow to 98.5 pounds.Contributing: Kelly Tyko, USA TODAYThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Popeyes chicken sandwich: The food fight of 2019 won't end in 2020ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKFC's New 'Vegan' Fried Chicken Technically Isn't VeganMen's HealthStarbucks to launch plant-based Beyond Meat sandwich in CanadaMarketWatchRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
