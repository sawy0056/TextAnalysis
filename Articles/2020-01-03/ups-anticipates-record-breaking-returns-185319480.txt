That's up 26% from a year ago. The returns would mark a seventh-consecutive annual record as consumers increasingly shift from shopping in-store to online. "This process is a change from years past, when consumers would rush to physical retailers the day after Christmas and stand in long lines to make returns," UPS said in a press release.Nowadays, consumers shop with returns in mind, a UPS study found. And 73% of shoppers say their experience making returns affects their likelihood to buy from a retailer again. The National Retail Federation said more than half (55%) of shoppers planned to return or exchange any unwanted gifts within a month of receiving them. A look back: Here are Google's top-searched people from every year over the past decadePossibility or pipe dream: How close are we to seeing flying cars?In the weeks leading up to Christmas, e-commerce sales hit a record high in the U.S., according to a report from Mastercard released last week. It found clothing, accessories and electronics to be the primary drivers behind the e-commerce boom with specialty apparel sales jumping 17%. Jewelry sales increased 8.8% and electrics sales grew 10.7% over last year. Amazon, with its flexible customer return policy, was a favorite among online shoppers.
