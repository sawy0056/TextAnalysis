View our latest analysis for Flutter Entertainment How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share (in the reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Flutter Entertainment:P/E of 38.71 = €91.81 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, GBP ) ÷ €2.37 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.How Does Flutter Entertainment's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Flutter Entertainment has a higher P/E than the average (20.7) P/E for companies in the hospitality industry.ISE:FLTR Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Flutter Entertainment will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Flutter Entertainment shrunk earnings per share by 8.2% last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 3.1% per year over the last five years.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Flutter Entertainment's Balance SheetFlutter Entertainment's net debt is 4.9% of its market cap. So it doesn't have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On Flutter Entertainment's P/E RatioFlutter Entertainment has a P/E of 38.7. That's significantly higher than the average in its market, which is 12.3. With modest debt but no EPS growth in the last year, it's fair to say the P/E implies some optimism about future earnings, from the market.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is better than it expects, you can make money by buying and holding for the long term. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.Story continuesBut note: Flutter Entertainment may not be the best stock to buy.
