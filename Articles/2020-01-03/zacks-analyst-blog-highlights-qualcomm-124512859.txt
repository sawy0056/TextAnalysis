MTSI.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks to Tap Likely Phase One Trade Deal in JanuaryOne of the main reasons for a terrific Wall Street turnaround from the 2018 mayhem is continued flow of positive news on the trade conflict between the United States and China. Trade-related issues were mainly behind the stock market rout in the fourth quarter of 2018. The lingering trade tussle is finally likely to be heading for an interim solution in January.The possibility of the signing of the phase-one trade deal between the United States and China in early January significantly boosted investors’ sentiment in December. This is a major step toward resolving a nearly two-year long trade dispute between the two largest trading countries of the world. This trade dispute and subsequent tariff war not only affected the economies of the United States and China but also slowed global economic growth.Possible Phase-One Deal in Early JanuaryOn Dec 13, the United States and China declared that they have reached a phase-one trade deal likely to be signed by the two presidents in the first half of January.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the deal will address intellectual-property disputes along with strong enforcement provisions and financial services and currency issues in addition to tariff rollback and higher agricultural purchase. Notably, China has reportedly agreed to substantially raise its agricultural imports from the United States to $40 billion.On Dec 23, The Wall Street Journal reported that China’s cabinet has agreed to lower tariffs for all trading partners on more than 859 types of products including pharmaceuticals, frozen pork and some high-tech components to below the rates that the most-favored nations enjoy.National Security Concerns Dominate Trump’s DecisionThe Trump administration is gravely concerned about China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier in the fields of high-tech sophisticated products. The implementation of tariffs stems from the Trump administration’s concern that China is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft.Several news agencies reported that China has made unprecedented proposals on a range of issues including the protection of U.S. intellectual properties to resolve the trade disputes. The Asian economic giant has acknowledged that the United States has legitimate and genuine concerns about IP theft, forced technology transfer and cyber hacking by Chinese companies.Technology Sector to Benefit MostChina is the largest trading partner of the United States. A strong economy in China, the largest market for high-tech products, will give U.S. technology companies a solid boost. Moreover, China plays the role of a low-cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high-tech U.S. industries.An end to the U.S.-China trade spat is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth, which in turn will create demand for high-tech U.S. products. Likewise, the repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods should raise the profit margin of U.S. tech giants. Moreover, clinching an agreement with China, which will strictly protect U.S. intellectual properties, will be immensely beneficial for the home-grown tech behemoths.Out Top PicksAt this stage, it will be lucrative to invest in tech stocks to gain from a possible U.S. - China trade solution.
