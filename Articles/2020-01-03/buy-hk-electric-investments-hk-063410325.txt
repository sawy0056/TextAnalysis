Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.With a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. We'd agree the yield does look enticing. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis SEHK:2638 Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments paid out 115% of its profit as dividends. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, from the perspective of an investor who hopes to own the company for many years, a payout ratio of above 100% is definitely a concern.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments paid out 228% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. As HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.Is HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments's Balance Sheet Risky?As HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 5.49 times its EBITDA, HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments could be described as a highly leveraged company. While some companies can handle this level of leverage, we'd be concerned about the dividend sustainability if there was any risk of an earnings downturn.We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 4.65 times its interest expense, HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments's interest cover is starting to look a bit thin. Low interest cover and high debt can create problems right when the investor least needs them, and we're reluctant to rely on the dividend of companies with these traits.Story continuesRemember, you can always get a snapshot of HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Looking at the data, we can see that HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments has been paying a dividend for the past six years. Although it has been paying a dividend for several years now, the dividend has been cut at least once by more than 20%, and we're cautious about the consistency of its dividend across a full economic cycle. During the past six-year period, the first annual payment was HK$4.04 in 2014, compared to HK$0.36 last year. This works out to a decline of approximately 91% over that time.We struggle to make a case for buying HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past six years.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. Over the past five years, it looks as though HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments's EPS have declined at around 12% a year. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. It's a concern to see that the company paid out such a high percentage of its earnings and cashflow as dividends. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and its dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Using these criteria, HK Electric Investments and HK Electric Investments looks quite suboptimal from a dividend investment perspective.Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive.
