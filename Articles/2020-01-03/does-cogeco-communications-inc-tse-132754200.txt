(TSE:CCA) Fare As A Dividend Stock?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosIs Cogeco Communications Inc. (TSE:CCA) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.A slim 2.0% yield is hard to get excited about, but the long payment history is respectable. At the right price, or with strong growth opportunities, Cogeco Communications could have potential. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Cogeco Communications for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis TSX:CCA Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 30% of Cogeco Communications's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Cogeco Communications's cash payout ratio last year was 22%, which is quite low and suggests that the dividend was thoroughly covered by cash flow. It's positive to see that Cogeco Communications's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Is Cogeco Communications's Balance Sheet Risky?As Cogeco Communications has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 2.57 times its EBITDA, Cogeco Communications has a noticeable amount of debt, although if business stays steady, this may not be overly concerning.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 3.52 times its interest expense, Cogeco Communications's interest cover is starting to look a bit thin.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Cogeco Communications's latest financial position,

Cogeco Communications has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was CA$0.48 in 2010, compared to CA$2.32 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 17% per year over this time.Story continuesIt's rare to find a company that has grown its dividends rapidly over ten years and not had any notable cuts, but Cogeco Communications has done it, which we really like.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Earnings have grown at around 9.9% a year for the past five years, which is better than seeing them shrink! Earnings per share have been growing at a credible rate. What's more, the payout ratio is reasonable and provides some protection to the dividend, or even the potential to increase it.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Firstly, we like that Cogeco Communications has low and conservative payout ratios. We like that it has been delivering solid improvement in its earnings per share, and relatively consistent dividend payments. Overall, we think there are a lot of positives to Cogeco Communications from a dividend perspective.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
