#JewishandProud  Day on
Monday, January 6."Enough is enough. We will not shy away from publicly displaying, celebrating our Jewish identity and faith," said AJC CEO David Harris.The AJC
#JewishandProud  Day initiative comes amidst surging antisemitism in the U.S., with a series of violent attacks in December alone, and continuing antisemitic attacks across Europe.In October, AJC, the leading global Jewish advocacy organization, found in its landmark survey of American Jews that 31% avoid publicly wearing, carrying or displaying things that might help people identify them as Jews, and 25% avoid certain places, events, or situations at least some of the time out of concern for their safety or comfort as Jews."The most visible of our brethren, Jews who are easily identifiable because they proudly wear yarmulkes and traditional clothing, have become the number one targets, but if any Jew anywhere is attacked for being a Jew, we must all respond in total support and solidarity," said Harris. "With #JewishandProud we encourage all Jews, however one identifies Jewishly, to show that none of us will allow those who desire to threaten or harm us to triumph."To participate in #JewishandProud, sign up at
www.AJC.org/jewish-and-proud
