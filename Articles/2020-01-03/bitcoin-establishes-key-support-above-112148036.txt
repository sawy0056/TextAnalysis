It found that the amount of people typing ‘Bitcoin’ into Google had dropped by 87% since the height of the bull market, which demonstrates how the public has fallen out of love with cryptocurrencies following the hype-fuelled mania two years ago.For more news, guides and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.The post Bitcoin establishes key support above $7,000 as bulls target reversal appeared first on Coin Rivet.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCryptocurrency News: SEC Shuts Down Another Bitcoin ETFInvestopediaCoronavirus Hits US Stocks, Bitcoin Climbs, Haven Status UnclearCoindeskSteven Seagal settles with SEC over undisclosed bitcoin promotionsEngadgetWorld’s Top Crypto Miners Race to Roll Out Top-of-Line Machines Ahead of Bitcoin HalvingCoindeskHow bond, stock, bitcoin, and copper markets are reacting to coronavirusQuartzRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
