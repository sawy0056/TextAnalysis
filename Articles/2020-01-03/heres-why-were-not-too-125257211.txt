For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Lipidor (STO:LIPI) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. In this article, we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow, which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. See our latest analysis for Lipidor When Might Lipidor Run Out Of Money?A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. In September 2019, Lipidor had kr33m in cash, and was debt-free. Importantly, its cash burn was kr12m over the trailing twelve months. So it had a cash runway of about 2.7 years from September 2019. That's decent, giving the company a couple years to develop its business. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.OM:LIPI Historical Debt, January 2nd 2020MoreHow Is Lipidor's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?In our view, Lipidor doesn't yet produce significant amounts of operating revenue, since it reported just kr72k in the last twelve months. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on how the cash burn is tracking. Remarkably, it actually increased its cash burn by 304% in the last year. Given that sharp increase in spending, the company's cash runway will shrink rapidly as it depletes its cash reserves. Admittedly, we're a bit cautious of Lipidor due to its lack of significant operating revenues. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.Can Lipidor Raise More Cash Easily?While Lipidor does have a solid cash runway, its cash burn trajectory may have some shareholders thinking ahead to when the company may need to raise more cash. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).Lipidor's cash burn of kr12m is about 3.1% of its kr388m market capitalisation. Given that is a rather small percentage, it would probably be really easy for the company to fund another year's growth by issuing some new shares to investors, or even by taking out a loan.Is Lipidor's Cash Burn A Worry?It may already be apparent to you that we're relatively comfortable with the way Lipidor is burning through its cash. For example, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap suggests that the company is on a good path. While we must concede that its increasing cash burn is a bit worrying, the other factors mentioned in this article provide great comfort when it comes to the cash burn. Considering all the factors discussed in this article, we're not overly concerned about the company's cash burn, although we do think shareholders should keep an eye on how it develops. For us, it's always important to consider risks around cash burn rates. But investors should look at a whole range of factors when researching a new stock. For example, it could be interesting to see how much the Lipidor CEO receives in total remuneration.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.
