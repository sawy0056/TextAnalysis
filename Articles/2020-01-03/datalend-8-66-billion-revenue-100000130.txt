Securities lending revenue is calculated as the amount paid by borrowers, typically broker-dealers on behalf of their hedge fund clients, to temporarily borrow equity and fixed income securities from long-holders of these assets, known as beneficial owners.According to DataLend, the decline in revenue was experienced across all regions globally and in both the equity and fixed income markets. On-loan balances and fees to borrow also declined in all regions, with the exception of Asia-Pacific, which experienced a marginal increase in balance.Nancy Allen, Global Product Owner of DataLend, says: "Global macro uncertainty, driven by trade wars, Brexit and central bank actions, resulted in a general lack of conviction by hedge funds and alternative investment managers in 2019. As uncertainty loomed, the securities lending markets experienced lower on-loan balances and fees globally. However, a significant amount of revenue was generated from lending a very concentrated number of securities. Beneficial owners lending those 'hot' securities likely will have experienced a more positive 2019."The securities finance market experienced a slight recovery in the 3rd and 4th quarters, specifically in the equity markets, where a handful of "specials"—also known as "hot" or "hard-to-borrow" securities that trade 500 basis points (bps) and above in the securities lending market—drove revenue higher.The top five revenue-generating securities in the global securities lending market in 2019 were Beyond Meat, Aurora Cannabis, Canopy Growth, NIO and Casino Guichard-Perrachon, which together generated $680 million in lending revenue in 2019.About DataLendDataLend is the securities finance market data division of EquiLend.
