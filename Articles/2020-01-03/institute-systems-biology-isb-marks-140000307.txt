For the past two decades, our scientists have been on the ground floor on many important research areas -- aging and wellness, computational biology, brain diseases, and many chronic and infectious diseases, to name a few. Furthermore, ISB has improved the quality of and accessibility to STEM education through curriculum development and by working with entire school systems to get students thinking like scientists.ISB remains at the cutting edge of science. Our research is focused on using the tools of systems biology to define an individual's state of wellness, to detect early transitions to disease, and to develop proactive interventions designed to prevent the full development of disease. We believe every patient is unique, and our affiliation with Providence St. Joseph Health, one of the nation's largest not-for-profit health care systems, provides a pipeline to rapidly move developments from the research bench to a patient's bedside.Our labs are working on big problems such as developing personalized cancer treatments and harnessing an individual's immune system to fight disease, slowing the progression of Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, embracing machine learning to create biomedical, interpretable risk models for clinical decision support, and much more. SOURCE Institute for Systems BiologyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHow Does China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings Limited (HKG:512) Stand Up To These Simple Dividend Safety Checks?Simply Wall St.Post 9/11 veterans attribute deadly cancers to contaminants at US base in UzbekistanMilitary TimesDem Congresswomen Who Criticized Sanders over Cuba Remarks Skip Vote to CondemnNational ReviewEmergency Physicians and Emergency Nurses Need More Resources to Fight CoronavirusPR NewswireYes, Men Can Still Support Their FamiliesBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
