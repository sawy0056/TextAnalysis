Rising demand for lightweight steel in the automotive industry is expected to be a major growth driver of this market. There is an urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions from automobiles and adoption of high strength steel in place of carbon steel offers a viable solution to this problem. This category of steel is known for its high strength capacity, which reduces the conventional steel requirement to manufacture vehicles and vehicular parts. Furthermore, high strength steel has a greater yield of 275 MPa and above along with carbon content between 0.05% and 0.25%, manganese content below 2%, and a combination of other metals. These properties make this type of the steel the ideal candidate for producing lightweight vehicles and this will also become one of the leading High Strength Steel Market trends.According to a new Fortune Business Insights™ report, titled “High Strength Steel Market Size, Share & Industry Analysis, By Type (High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA), Dual Phase (DP), Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP), Martensitic (MS), and Others), By Application (Automotive; Building & Construction; Mechanical & Heavy Equipment; Rail, Aviation & Marine; and Others), and Regional Forecast, 2019-2026”, the value of this market stood at USD 28.79 billion in 2018.To Gain More Insights into the Market with Detailed Table of Content and Figures, Click Here: https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/high-strength-steel-market-101854List of top players covered in High Strength Steel Market Research Report are:ArcelorMittal S.A.Baosteel Group CorporationNippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal CorporationHBIS GroupPosco GroupJFE Steel CorporationUnited States Steel CorporationChina Steel CorporationSteel Authority of India Limited (SAIL)Tata SteelAngang Steel Company LimitedHebei Puyong Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd.JSW SteelSSAB ABNovolipetsk Steel (NLMK)CITIC Pacific Special Steel HoldingsHyundai Steel CompanyVoestalpine AGNucor CorporationThyssenkrupp AgMetinvest Holding, LLCPAO SeverstalGerdau S.A.Shandong Iron and Steel GroupOther Key PlayersGet Sample PDF: https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/enquiry/request-sample-pdf/high-strength-steel-market-101854Multifaceted Nature of High Strength Steel to Fuel Its Demand Across IndustriesSteel is the backbone of majority of industries in the world and is one of the core materials that can meet a host end-user needs.
