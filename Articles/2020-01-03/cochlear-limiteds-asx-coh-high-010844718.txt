To keep it practical, we'll show how Cochlear Limited's (ASX:COH) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. What is Cochlear's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 46.85. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 2.1%. See our latest analysis for Cochlear How Do I Calculate Cochlear's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Cochlear:P/E of 46.85 = A$224.73 ÷ A$4.80 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each A$1 the company has earned over the last year. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does Cochlear Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. As you can see below, Cochlear has a higher P/E than the average company (34.6) in the medical equipment industry.ASX:COH Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Cochlear shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Most would be impressed by Cochlear earnings growth of 12% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 24%. This could arguably justify a relatively high P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Cochlear's Balance SheetCochlear has net debt worth just 0.8% of its market capitalization. The market might award it a higher P/E ratio if it had net cash, but its unlikely this low level of net borrowing is having a big impact on the P/E multiple.The Verdict On Cochlear's P/E RatioCochlear trades on a P/E ratio of 46.9, which is above its market average of 18.9. While the company does use modest debt, its recent earnings growth is very good. So on this analysis it seems reasonable that its P/E ratio is above average.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.
