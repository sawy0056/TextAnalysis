(NASDAQ:ANIX) share price up 14% in a week. But that cannot eclipse the less-than-impressive returns over the last three years. In fact, the share price is down 38% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return. Check out our latest analysis for Anixa Biosciences We don't think Anixa Biosciences's revenue of US$250,000 is enough to establish significant demand. You have to wonder why venture capitalists aren't funding it. So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. For example, they may be hoping that Anixa Biosciences comes up with a great new product, before it runs out of money.As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some such companies do very well over the long term, others become hyped up by promoters before eventually falling back down to earth, and going bankrupt (or being recapitalized).When it last reported its balance sheet in July 2019, Anixa Biosciences had cash in excess of all liabilities of US$5.1m. While that's nothing to panic about, there is some possibility the company will raise more capital, especially if profits are not imminent. We'd venture that shareholders are concerned about the need for more capital, because the share price has dropped 15% per year, over 3 years .

There's no way to know its value easily. What if insiders are ditching the stock hand over fist? I would feel more nervous about the company if that were so. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.A Different PerspectiveAnixa Biosciences shareholders are down 17% for the year, but the market itself is up 32%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3.2% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.
