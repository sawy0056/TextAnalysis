So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. View our latest analysis for Alteryx How Much Debt Does Alteryx Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2019 Alteryx had debt of US$690.8m, up from US$171 in one year. However, it does have US$874.4m in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$183.6m.NYSE:AYX Historical Debt, January 2nd 2020MoreHow Healthy Is Alteryx's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Alteryx had liabilities of US$190.8m due within 12 months and liabilities of US$661.8m due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$874.4m in cash and US$88.8m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$110.7m more liquid assets than total liabilities.This state of affairs indicates that Alteryx's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$6.51b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that Alteryx has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.Notably, Alteryx's EBIT launched higher than Elon Musk, gaining a whopping 228% on last year. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Alteryx's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. Alteryx may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Happily for any shareholders, Alteryx actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last two years. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.Summing upWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Alteryx has net cash of US$183.6m, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$21m, being 131% of its EBIT. So we don't think Alteryx's use of debt is risky.
