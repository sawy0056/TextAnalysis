Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ENXTLS:ESON Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, Estoril Sol SGPS paid out 44% of its profit as dividends. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Estoril Sol SGPS's cash payout ratio last year was 21%. Cash flows are typically lumpy, but this looks like an appropriately conservative payout. It's positive to see that Estoril Sol SGPS's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.With a strong net cash balance, Estoril Sol SGPS investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Estoril Sol SGPS's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. The company has been paying a stable dividend for a few years now, but we'd like to see more evidence of consistency over a longer period. During the past two-year period, the first annual payment was €0.34 in 2018, compared to €0.42 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 12% per year over this time.We're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. It's good to see Estoril Sol SGPS has been growing its earnings per share at 40% a year over the past five years. With high earnings per share growth in recent times and a modest payout ratio, we think this is an attractive combination if earnings can be reinvested to generate further growth.Story continuesConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, we like that the company's dividend payments appear well covered, although the retained capital also needs to be effectively reinvested. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the company has not been paying dividends as long as we'd like. All things considered, Estoril Sol SGPS looks like a strong prospect. At the right valuation, it could be something special.Are management backing themselves to deliver performance?
