We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to KSH Holdings Limited's (SGX:ER0), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, KSH Holdings has a P/E ratio of 22.44. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 4.5%. See our latest analysis for KSH Holdings How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for KSH Holdings:P/E of 22.44 = SGD0.45 ÷ SGD0.02 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each SGD1 of company earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does KSH Holdings's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. As you can see below, KSH Holdings has a higher P/E than the average company (15.4) in the construction industry.SGX:ER0 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreKSH Holdings's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.KSH Holdings shrunk earnings per share by 59% over the last year. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 21% per year over the last five years. This growth rate might warrant a below average P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.KSH Holdings's Balance SheetNet debt is 32% of KSH Holdings's market cap. You'd want to be aware of this fact, but it doesn't bother us.The Bottom Line On KSH Holdings's P/E RatioKSH Holdings's P/E is 22.4 which is above average (13.5) in its market.
