On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in CaixaBank, S.A. (BME:CABK).Do Insider Transactions Matter?Most investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. Check out our latest analysis for CaixaBank CaixaBank Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when CEO & Executive Director Gonzalo Gortázar Rotaeche bought €302k worth of shares at a price of €2.98 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of €2.80. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.While CaixaBank insiders bought shares last year, they didn't sell. The average buy price was around €2.61. It's great to see insiders putting their own cash into the company's stock, albeit at below the recent share price.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Our data suggests CaixaBank insiders own 0.02% of the company, worth about €4.2m. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. We prefer to see high levels of insider ownership.So What Do The CaixaBank Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded CaixaBank shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. The transactions are fine but it'd be more encouraging if CaixaBank insiders bought more shares in the company.
