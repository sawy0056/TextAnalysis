For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed.So, the natural question for Altai Resources (CVE:ATI) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. Check out our latest analysis for Altai Resources When Might Altai Resources Run Out Of Money?A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. When Altai Resources last reported its balance sheet in September 2019, it had zero debt and cash worth CA$3.8m. Importantly, its cash burn was CA$53k over the trailing twelve months. So it had a very long cash runway of many years from September 2019. Even though this is but one measure of the company's cash burn, the thought of such a long cash runway warms our bellies in a comforting way. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.TSXV:ATI Historical Debt, January 1st 2020MoreHow Is Altai Resources's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Whilst it's great to see that Altai Resources has already begun generating revenue from operations, last year it only produced CA$111k, so we don't think it is generating significant revenue, at this point. As a result, we think it's a bit early to focus on the revenue growth, so we'll limit ourselves to looking at how the cash burn is changing over time. Over the last year its cash burn actually increased by 50%, which suggests that management are increasing investment in future growth, but not too quickly. However, the company's true cash runway will therefore be shorter than suggested above, if spending continues to increase. Altai Resources makes us a little nervous due to its lack of substantial operating revenue. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.How Hard Would It Be For Altai Resources To Raise More Cash For Growth?While Altai Resources does have a solid cash runway, its cash burn trajectory may have some shareholders thinking ahead to when the company may need to raise more cash. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).Altai Resources's cash burn of CA$53k is about 1.5% of its CA$3.6m market capitalisation. So it could almost certainly just borrow a little to fund another year's growth, or else easily raise the cash by issuing a few shares.How Risky Is Altai Resources's Cash Burn Situation?As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Altai Resources's cash burn. For example, we think its cash runway suggests that the company is on a good path. Although its increasing cash burn does give us reason for pause, the other metrics we discussed in this article form a positive picture overall. After taking into account the various metrics mentioned in this report, we're pretty comfortable with how the company is spending its cash. While we always like to monitor cash burn for early stage companies, qualitative factors such as the CEO pay can also shed light on the situation.
