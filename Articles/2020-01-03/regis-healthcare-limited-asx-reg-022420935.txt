Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.With a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if Regis Healthcare is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Regis Healthcare for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ASX:REG Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Regis Healthcare paid out 90% of its profit as dividends. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Regis Healthcare's cash payout ratio in the last year was 32%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's positive to see that Regis Healthcare's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Is Regis Healthcare's Balance Sheet Risky?As Regis Healthcare has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 2.48 times its EBITDA, Regis Healthcare's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Regis Healthcare has EBIT of 6.19 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Regis Healthcare's latest financial position,

Regis Healthcare has been paying a dividend for the past four years. It has only been paying dividends for a few short years, and the dividend has already been cut at least once. This is one income stream we're not ready to live on. During the past four-year period, the first annual payment was AU$0.18 in 2016, compared to AU$0.14 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 5.2% a year during that period. Regis Healthcare's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 5.2% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.Story continuesA shrinking dividend over a four-year period is not ideal, and we'd be concerned about investing in a dividend stock that lacks a solid record of growing dividends per share.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, and a poor history of shrinking dividends, it's even more important to see if EPS are growing. It's good to see Regis Healthcare has been growing its earnings per share at 114% a year over the past five years. The company pays out most of its earnings as dividends, although with such rapid EPS growth, its possible the dividend is better covered than it looks. Still, we'd be cautious about extrapolating high growth too far out into the future.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Regis Healthcare's payout ratios are within a normal range for the average corporation, and we like that its cashflow was stronger than reported profits. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, but it was concerning to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Regis Healthcare has a number of positive attributes, but it falls slightly short of our (admittedly high) standards. Were there evidence of a strong moat or an attractive valuation, it could still be well worth a look.Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
