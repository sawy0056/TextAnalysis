The proposal aims to delay the difficulty bomb, a built-in algorithm of the Ethereum blockchain that could drastically increase the difficulty in mining a new block if left unaccounted for. The update is designed to delay the difficulty bomb for another 4,000,000 blocks, or approximately 611 days. This is the third difficulty bomb delay the Ethereum network has undergone, with the first two occurred in 2018 and 2019. The Muir Glacier update, which took place three weeks after the last update Istanbul, was due to a miscalculation when planning Istanbul, said Ethereum developer Pooja Ranjan in a Medium post.  The developer community initially estimated the difficulty bomb to become noticeable in mid-2020. However, instead, the bomb became noticeable in October, forcing the community to address the issue sooner than planned. Some developers have voiced concerns over the difficulty bomb, asking for a removal of this algorithm completely. However, given the short time frame, the developer team eventually decided to move forward with another delay, Ranjan stated.Besides the mainnet, the Ropsten testnet also deployed the same update at block number 7117117, while other Ethereum testnets remain unchanged.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextA 101 Guide to Ethereum’s ProgPOW ControversyCoindeskBinance Throws Weight Behind Shyft Network in ‘Travel Rule’ Standards RaceCoindeskCan cryptocurrency become the UN money of the future?QuartzEOS, Ethereum and Ripple’s XRP – Daily Tech Analysis – 27/02/20FX EmpireEthereum community members submit dissenting ProgPoW petitionThe BlockRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
