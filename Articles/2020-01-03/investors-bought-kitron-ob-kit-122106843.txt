While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. To wit, the Kitron ASA (OB:KIT) share price has soared 518% over five years. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 22% gain in the last three months.It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors. Check out our latest analysis for Kitron While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Kitron achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 110% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 44% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).OB:KIT Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Kitron's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Kitron the TSR over the last 5 years was 660%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Kitron shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 29% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, that falls short of the 50% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.Kitron is not the only stock that insiders are buying.
