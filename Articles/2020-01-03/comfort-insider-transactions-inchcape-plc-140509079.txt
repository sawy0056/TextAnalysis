The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Inchcape plc (LON:INCH).What Is Insider Buying?It is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year. See our latest analysis for Inchcape Inchcape Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIndependent Chairman of the Board Nigel Stein made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for UK£59k worth of shares at a price of UK£5.90 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of UK£7.06. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 13.53k shares for UK£81k.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Inchcape insiders own 2.0% of the company, worth about UK£55m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.What Might The Insider Transactions At Inchcape Tell Us?Our data shows a little more insider selling than buying in the last three months.
