But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Iteris, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITI) which saw its share price drive 193% higher over five years. View our latest analysis for Iteris Iteris isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.For the last half decade, Iteris can boast revenue growth at a rate of 8.5% per year. That's a fairly respectable growth rate. Broadly speaking, this solid progress may well be reflected by the healthy share price gain of 24% per year over five years. It's well worth monitoring the growth trend in revenue, because if growth accelerates, that might signal an opportunity. Accelerating growth can be a sign of an inflection point - and could indicate profits lie ahead.
