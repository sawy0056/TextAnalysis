(NASDAQ:AFIN): When Will It Breakeven?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosAmerican Finance Trust, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AFIN): American Finance Trust, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFIN) is a publicly traded real estate investment trust listed on the Nasdaq focused on acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of primarily service-oriented and traditional retail and distribution related commercial real estate properties in the U.S. With the latest financial year loss of -US$37.4m and a trailing-twelve month of -US$11.8m, the US$1.4b market-cap alleviates its loss by moving closer towards its target of breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is AFIN’s path to profitability – when will it breakeven? I’ve put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for AFIN, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. See our latest analysis for American Finance Trust Expectation from REITs analysts is AFIN is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2020, before turning a profit of US$6.9m in 2021. Therefore, AFIN is expected to breakeven roughly a couple of months from now! How fast will AFIN have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2021? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 111% year-on-year, on average, which is rather optimistic! Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.NasdaqGS:AFIN Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreGiven this is a high-level overview, I won’t go into details of AFIN’s upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that typically a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.One thing I would like to bring into light with AFIN is its relatively high level of debt. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in AFIN’s case is 97%. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk in investing in the loss-making company.Next Steps:This article is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis on AFIN, so if you are interested in understanding the company at a deeper level, take a look at AFIN’s company page on Simply Wall St. I’ve also compiled a list of key factors you should further examine:Valuation: What is AFIN worth today?
