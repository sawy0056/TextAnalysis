What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital. When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Haw Par Corporation Limited (SGX:H02) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for Haw Par What Is Haw Par's Net Debt?As you can see below, at the end of September 2019, Haw Par had S$24.2m of debt, up from S$23.1 a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it does have S$440.7m in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of S$416.5m.SGX:H02 Historical Debt, January 2nd 2020MoreHow Strong Is Haw Par's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Haw Par had liabilities of S$102.2m due within 12 months and liabilities of S$725.0k due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of S$440.7m and S$41.2m worth of receivables due within a year. So it can boast S$378.9m more liquid assets than total liabilities.This short term liquidity is a sign that Haw Par could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Succinctly put, Haw Par boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Fortunately, Haw Par grew its EBIT by 5.7% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Haw Par will need earnings to service that debt. So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. Click here for an interactive snapshot.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Haw Par has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. During the last three years, Haw Par generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 84% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Summing upWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Haw Par has net cash of S$416.5m, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 84% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in S$83m. So is Haw Par's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us.
