With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Brouwerij Handelsmaatschappij NV (EBR:COBH), by way of a worked example.Our data shows Brouwerij Handelsmaatschappij has a return on equity of 3.7% for the last year. That means that for every €1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated €0.04 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Brouwerij Handelsmaatschappij How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Brouwerij Handelsmaatschappij:3.7% = €4.4m ÷ €117m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Signify?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Brouwerij Handelsmaatschappij Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Brouwerij Handelsmaatschappij has a lower ROE than the average (11%) in the Beverage industry classification.ENXTBR:COBH Past Revenue and Net Income, January 2nd 2020MoreThat's not what we like to see. We'd prefer see an ROE above the industry average, but it might not matter if the company is undervalued. Nonetheless, it could be useful to double-check if insiders have sold shares recently.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Brouwerij Handelsmaatschappij's Debt And Its 3.7% ROEBrouwerij Handelsmaatschappij has a debt to equity ratio of just 0.057, which is very low. I'm not impressed with its ROE, but the debt levels are not too high, indicating the business has decent prospects. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.In SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
