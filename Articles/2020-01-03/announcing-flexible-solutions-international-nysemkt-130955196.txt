But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Flexible Solutions International Inc. (NYSEMKT:FSI) which saw its share price drive 127% higher over five years. It's also up 11% in about a month. See our latest analysis for Flexible Solutions International While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Flexible Solutions International's earnings per share are down 14% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Because earnings per share don't seem to match up with the share price, we'll take a look at other metrics instead.There's no sign of growing dividends, which might have explained the resilient share price. It could be that the revenue growth of 7.2% per year is viewed as evidence that Flexible Solutions International is growing. Indeed, revenue growth, rather than EPS, might be the current focus of the business.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).AMEX:FSI Income Statement, January 2nd 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at Flexible Solutions International's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Flexible Solutions International the TSR over the last 5 years was 149%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Flexible Solutions International shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 109% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 20% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
