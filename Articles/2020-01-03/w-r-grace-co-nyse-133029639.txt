R. Grace & Co. (NYSE:GRA) A Good Fit For Your Dividend Portfolio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosIs W. R. Grace & Co. (NYSE:GRA) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.Investors might not know much about W. R. Grace's dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last four years and offers a 1.5% yield. A 1.5% yield is not inspiring, but the longer payment history has some appeal. The company also returned around 0.7% of its market capitalisation to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks over the past year. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on W. R. Grace! NYSE:GRA Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 31% of W. R. Grace's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. W. R. Grace's cash payout ratio in the last year was 39%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Is W. R. Grace's Balance Sheet Risky?As W. R. Grace has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. W. R. Grace has net debt of 4.04 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the limit of most investors' comfort zones. Judicious use of debt can enhance shareholder returns, but also adds to the risk if something goes awry.We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 4.39 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for W. R. Grace, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.Consider getting
our latest analysis on W. R. Grace's financial position here.Story continuesDividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Looking at the data, we can see that W. R. Grace has been paying a dividend for the past four years. The company has been paying a stable dividend for a few years now, but we'd like to see more evidence of consistency over a longer period. During the past four-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.68 in 2016, compared to US$1.08 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 12% per year over this time.The dividend has been growing pretty quickly, which could be enough to get us interested even though the dividend history is relatively short. Further research may be warranted.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. W. R. Grace's earnings per share have been essentially flat over the past five years. Flat earnings per share are acceptable for a time, but over the long term, the purchasing power of the company's dividends could be eroded by inflation.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that W. R. Grace's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we like that the company's dividend payments appear well covered, although the retained capital also needs to be effectively reinvested. Earnings per share are down, and to our mind W. R. Grace has not been paying a dividend long enough to demonstrate its resilience across economic cycles. Ultimately, W. R. Grace comes up short on our dividend analysis. It's not that we think it is a bad company - just that there are likely more appealing dividend prospects out there on this analysis.Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive.
