But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So spare a thought for the long term shareholders of Affinor Growers Inc. (CSE:AFI); the share price is down a whopping 71% in the last three years. That would certainly shake our confidence in the decision to own the stock. The silver lining is that the stock is up 50% in about a week. See our latest analysis for Affinor Growers With just CA$56,550 worth of revenue in twelve months, we don't think the market considers Affinor Growers to have proven its business plan. This state of affairs suggests that venture capitalists won't provide funds on attractive terms. As a result, we think it's unlikely shareholders are paying much attention to current revenue, but rather speculating on growth in the years to come. Investors will be hoping that Affinor Growers can make progress and gain better traction for the business, before it runs low on cash.Companies that lack both meaningful revenue and profits are usually considered high risk. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt. Affinor Growers has already given some investors a taste of the bitter losses that high risk investing can cause.Affinor Growers had liabilities exceeding cash by CA$269k when it last reported in August 2019, according to our data. That makes it extremely high risk, in our view. But since the share price has dived -34% per year, over 3 years , it looks like some investors think it's time to abandon ship, so to speak.

Given that situation, would you be concerned if it turned out insiders were relentlessly selling stock? I'd like that just about as much as I like to drink milk and fruit juice mixed together. You can click here to see if there are insiders selling.A Different PerspectiveAffinor Growers shareholders are down 14% for the year, but the broader market is up 18%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 34% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last three years. We would want clear information suggesting the company will grow, before taking the view that the share price will stabilize.
