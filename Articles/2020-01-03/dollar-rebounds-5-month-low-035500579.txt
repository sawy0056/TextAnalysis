Despite the modest bounce, the dollar index has lost nearly 1% over the last week, chiefly against sterling and commodity currencies such as the Aussie and loonie. The euro was steady at $1.1210, having breached $1.1200 for the first time since August.Overnight, the Chinese central bank again loosened its monetary stance with a further cut in its reserve requirement ratio. The move freed up over $110 billion in liquidity for the domestic banking system, which has struggled increasingly in recent months with an overhang of corporate debt.The move, coming on the back of the news of the trade deal with the U.S., also propelled China’s stock index to its highest in nearly two years.The day’s data calendar is dominated by the release of purchasing manager indexes by IHS Markit. The Chinese PMI fell to a three-month low earlier, but stayed comfortably in expansion territory, but the impact of that was softened by an encouraging bounce in industrial profits in November that was announced last week.In Europe, meanwhile, the Spanish reading fell less than expected but Italy’s fell to 46.2, its lowest since April 2013. France’s and Germany's ticked up fractionally from the flash assessments to 50.4 and 43.7, respectively.Later in the day, the Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its December policy meeting, while there will also be initial jobless claims data, as usual.Markets are unlikely to return to full swing until Monday.Related ArticlesDollar off to a flat start for 2020 as others find the fizzOptimism on trade and global growth knock dollarU.S. dollar share of global currency reserves highest for a year in third quarter: IMF dataReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; WHO Sees ‘Decisive’ Stage: Virus UpdateBloombergKorea Virus Threat Puts Expected Trump-Kim Face-Off on HoldBloombergHow investors are using ‘alternative’ data to track China’s recovery from coronaviruMarketWatchCalifornia at heart of battle to choose Trump's opponentAFPBiden Says He’d Pick Michelle Obama: Campaign UpdateBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
