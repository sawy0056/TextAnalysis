POSOCO releases provisional load despatch data every day.Lower electricity supply could mean a fifth consecutive fall in power demand, as electricity deficit in India is marginal.Electricity supply fell 4.2% in November and 12.8% in October, according to the CEA. The October decline in electricity demand and supply was the fastest in at least 12 years.Electricity demand is seen by economists as an important indicator of industrial output and a deceleration could point to a further slowdown.Annual consumption of electricity by industry accounts for more than two-fifths of India's annual electricity consumption, according to government data, with residences accounting for nearly a quarter and commercial establishments for another 8.5%.India's overall economic growth slowed to 4.5% in the July-September quarter, government data in November showed, the weakest pace since 2013 as consumer demand and private investment weakened.Slower economic activity has resulted in a fall in sales of everything from cars to cookies, prompting some large scale industries such as the automobile sector to slash jobs.(Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Alex Richardson)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump campaign ads target a new audience: Indian AmericansPoliticoUS urges India to allow peaceful assembly after riotsAFPA Delhi neighborhood divided by a highway and now hatredReutersRenewable energy finally takes off, as big money enters the industryMarketWatchIndia’s Fragile Economic Rebound Faces New Risk From CoronavirusBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
