Both sides have been accused of provoking clashes, and nearly 6,500 protesters as young as 12 have been arrested in scores of incidents on streets, in shopping malls and on college campuses.This year's event appeared to be significantly larger than in past years, although estimates of the numbers of participants often vary widely between organizers and police.HONG KONG PROTESTERS STAGE NEW YEAR MARCHES AS AUTHORITIES CANCEL MIDNIGHT FIREWORKSThe protests began in June over proposed legislation that could have allowed residents to be extradited to China where they could face possible torture and unfair trials. The legislation was withdrawn, but not before the protests expanded to wider calls for reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.In her New Year's address, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the months of protests had brought “sadness, anxiety, disappointment and even rage," and she vowed to tackle underlying social and economic problems in the coming year.Lam said she would “listen humbly" to help bring an end to the protests but also reinforced the importance of the “one country, two systems" framework under which China rules Hong Kong and which brooks no challenge to the ruling Communist Party's ultimate authority.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSIn his own New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping referred to the protests, saying “Hong Kong's prosperity and stability is the wish of Hong Kong compatriots and the expectation for the people of the motherland."The Associated Press contributed to this article.Related ArticlesFmr.
