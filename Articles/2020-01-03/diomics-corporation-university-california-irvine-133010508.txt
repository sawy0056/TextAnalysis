To circumvent these issues, cell encapsulation has been proposed as the next treatment option. Biomaterials can protect the transplanted islets from destruction from the body. Polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer has been used in cell replacement therapy, however, the PCL polymer degrade too slowly and exhibit poor cell adhesion qualities for optimal cell replacement therapy. Diomics’ technology overcomes these issues for improved cell adhesion.Leading the Diomics Sponsored Research Agreement research at UCI is Dr. Jonathan Lakey, a world-class subject matter expert on cell therapies including pancreatic islets and stem cells. Dr. Lakey has pioneered the development of novel methods for implantation of pancreatic islets for patients with diabetes. “I am thrilled for the opportunity to work with Diomics and examine this novel and important proprietary biomaterial,” said Dr Lakey. “I am most excited about the potential variety of applications for this novel material.”Diomics recently filed provisional patents with claims broadly covering its proprietary polymer technology, Diomat™, for applications in cell therapy, transdermal and related drug delivery methods. The Diomics and UCI research will support the development of key data that can be leveraged in clinical trials for improved islet transplantation therapy. Improved islet transplantation can restore natural insulin production for type 1 diabetes patients.In this sponsored research project, Diomat foams will be used to characterize the Diomics material and examine encapsulated pancreatic islets and stem cells for improved islet transplantation therapy. This data will provide the key results to proceed with clinical trials using Diomat foam-encapsulated products.“Diomics is committed to providing innovative solutions through its materials and technologies that will lead the way to remarkable life science discoveries,” said Diomics Chairman of the Board, Kirk Avery. “We are honored to collaborate with Dr. Lakey and UCI.”ABOUT DIOMICS CORPORATIONDiomics Corporation creates highly efficient hydrophilic materials, based on patented Diomat™ technology, that improve the speed, sensitivity, and accuracy in the capture and detection of nucleic acids, proteins, and similar compounds.
