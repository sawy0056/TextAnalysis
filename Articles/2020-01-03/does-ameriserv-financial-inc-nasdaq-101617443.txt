(NASDAQ:ASRV) Have A Good P/E Ratio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosAmeriServ Financial (NASDAQ:ASRV) shares have given back plenty of recent gains in the last month, dropping . Looking back further, the stock is up 4.5% in the last year.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. See our latest analysis for AmeriServ Financial How Does AmeriServ Financial's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 10.09 that sentiment around AmeriServ Financial isn't particularly high. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (13.1) for companies in the banks industry is higher than AmeriServ Financial's P/E.NasdaqGM:ASRV Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreAmeriServ Financial's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.In the last year, AmeriServ Financial grew EPS like Taylor Swift grew her fan base back in 2010; the 55% gain was both fast and well deserved. Even better, EPS is up 47% per year over three years. So we'd absolutely expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does AmeriServ Financial's Balance Sheet Tell Us?AmeriServ Financial's net debt is 75% of its market cap. This is a reasonably significant level of debt -- all else being equal you'd expect a much lower P/E than if it had net cash.The Bottom Line On AmeriServ Financial's P/E RatioAmeriServ Financial's P/E is 10.1 which is below average (18.9) in the US market. The company may have significant debt, but EPS growth was good last year. The low P/E ratio suggests current market expectations are muted, implying these levels of growth will not continue. Given AmeriServ Financial's P/E ratio has declined from 10.1 to 10.1 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is less confident about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
