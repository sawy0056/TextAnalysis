But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Image Sensing Systems (NASDAQ:ISNS). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath.

I refer to the very reasonable level of CEO pay. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Image Sensing Systems with market caps under US$200m is about US$523k.Image Sensing Systems offered total compensation worth US$337k to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Story continuesIs Image Sensing Systems Worth Keeping An Eye On?Image Sensing Systems's earnings per share growth have been levitating higher, like a mountain goat scaling the Alps.
