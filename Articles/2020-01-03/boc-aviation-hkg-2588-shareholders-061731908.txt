But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. To wit, the BOC Aviation Limited (HKG:2588) share price has flown 111% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! On top of that, the share price is up 10% in about a quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 8.3% in 90 days). View our latest analysis for BOC Aviation To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, BOC Aviation achieved compound earnings per share growth of 13% per year. In comparison, the 28% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:2588 Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, BOC Aviation's TSR for the last 3 years was 140%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectivePleasingly, BOC Aviation's total shareholder return last year was 44%. That's including the dividend. That gain actually surpasses the 34% TSR it generated (per year) over three years. Given the track record of solid returns over varying time frames, it might be worth putting BOC Aviation on your watchlist.
