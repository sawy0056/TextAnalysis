(NASDAQ:ICPT)Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosIntercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ICPT): Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat progressive non-viral liver diseases. With the latest financial year loss of -US$309.2m and a trailing-twelve month of -US$334.5m, the US$4.1b market-cap amplifies its loss by moving further away from its breakeven target. The most pressing concern for investors is ICPT’s path to profitability – when will it breakeven? Below I will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for ICPT. See our latest analysis for Intercept Pharmaceuticals Consensus from the 19 Biotechs analysts is ICPT is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2021, before turning a profit of US$279m in 2022. So, ICPT is predicted to breakeven approximately 2 years from now. What rate will ICPT have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, I calculated an average annual growth rate of 60%, which is extremely buoyant. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, ICPT may become profitable much later than analysts predict.NasdaqGS:ICPT Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreI’m not going to go through company-specific developments for ICPT given that this is a high-level summary, though, keep in mind that generally a biotech has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the product type and stage of development the company is in. This means that a high growth rate is not unusual, especially if the company is currently in an investment period.Before I wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning. ICPT currently has a debt-to-equity ratio of over 2x. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in ICPT’s case, it has significantly overshot. A higher level of debt requires more stringent capital management which increases the risk in investing in the loss-making company.Next Steps:There are too many aspects of ICPT to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – ICPT’s company page on Simply Wall St. I’ve also put together a list of key factors you should further examine:Valuation: What is ICPT worth today?
