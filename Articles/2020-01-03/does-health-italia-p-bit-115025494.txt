is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Health Italia:P/E of 17.11 = €3.99 ÷ €0.23 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business.

We can see in the image below that the average P/E (39.0) for companies in the healthcare industry is higher than Health Italia's P/E.BIT:HI Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Health Italia shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Since the market seems unimpressed with Health Italia, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.It's great to see that Health Italia grew EPS by 23% in the last year.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does Health Italia's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Net debt totals just 6.2% of Health Italia's market cap. The market might award it a higher P/E ratio if it had net cash, but its unlikely this low level of net borrowing is having a big impact on the P/E multiple.The Verdict On Health Italia's P/E RatioHealth Italia trades on a P/E ratio of 17.1, which is below the IT market average of 18.6. The company does have a little debt, and EPS growth was good last year. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low. Since analysts are predicting growth will continue, one might expect to see a higher P/E so it may be worth looking closer.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
