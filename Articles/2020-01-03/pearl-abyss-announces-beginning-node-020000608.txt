It is a great opportunity for guild members to work together and attain greater glory for themselves and their guild in the game.Guilds can participate in a Node War through a bidding process, where 3 guilds with the highest bids will be selected as participants. Participating guild members must attack the opposing guilds' Holy Artifacts while defending their own to win. Guilds that win the Node War will take possession of the Node for 7 days and receive large sums of silver collected as tax from the areas surrounding the Node. During the pre-season, Node Wars will take place from 10 PM to 12 PM (server time) on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Meanwhile, a special Pearl Shop event offering extra Black Pearls to Adventurers will continue to run this week.
