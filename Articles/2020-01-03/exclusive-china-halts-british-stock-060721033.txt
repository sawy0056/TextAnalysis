A spokesperson for the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> and a spokeswoman for the UK's finance ministry declined to comment.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a faxed statement that it is not aware of the specifics, but added that it "hopes the UK can provide a fair and unbiased business environment for Chinese companies that invest in the UK and create the appropriate conditions for both countries to carry out practical cooperation smoothly in various fields".Stock Connect, which began operating last year, was devised as a way of improving Britain's relationship with the world's second biggest economy and was seen as a major step by China to open up its capital markets as well as linking them globally.CHINA CHILLHuatai Securities was the first Chinese company to use the scheme in May, with SDIC Power set to become the second in December with a listing of global depository receipts (GDRs) in London representing 10% of its share capital.However, the alternative energy operator's deal was postponed at an advanced stage, with SDIC Power citing market conditions as the main reason.Five sources told Reuters SDIC Power's deal was halted because of Beijing's suspension of Stock Connect.Other hopefuls such as China Pacific Insurance, which one of the sources said could have launched a deal as early as the first quarter of 2020, have also been told to put their cross-border listing plans on ice, they added.SDIC Power and China Pacific Insurance did not respond to requests for comment."It's not only a big blow to the companies looking to broaden the investor base via listings in London, but also to China's links with global markets," one source, who has worked on one of the GDR deals, told Reuters.Trouble with the scheme comes at a bad time for Britain, which is keen to build ties with non-European Union countries as it prepares to leave the bloc, and the LSE.The London exchange was set for its worst year in terms of new listings in a decade as of Dec. 4, Refinitiv data showed, with political volatility and concerns over Britain's EU divorce crimping stock market fundraisings.(Reporting by Julie Zhu in HONG KONG, Abhinav Ramnarayan and Jonathan Saul in LONDON; additional reporting by Samuel Shen in SHANGHAI and Judy Hua in BEIJING; editing by Rachel Armstrong and Alexander Smith)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; WHO Sees ‘Decisive’ Stage: Virus UpdateBloombergHow investors are using ‘alternative’ data to track China’s recovery from coronaviruMarketWatchWorld prepares for coronavirus pandemic; global recession forecastReutersOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergChina Stock Option’s 2,800% Surge Shows Rush for HedgesBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
