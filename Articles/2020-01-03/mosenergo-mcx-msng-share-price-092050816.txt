But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. One great example is Public Joint Stock Company Mosenergo (MCX:MSNG) which saw its share price drive 241% higher over five years. In the last week the share price is up 1.1%. See our latest analysis for Mosenergo To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Mosenergo achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 33% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 28% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).MISX:MSNG Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how Mosenergo has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Mosenergo's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Mosenergo the TSR over the last 5 years was 332%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveMosenergo shareholders gained a total return of 19% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 34% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Mosenergo's dividend track record.
