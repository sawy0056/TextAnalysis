That brought the twelve month gain to a very sharp 94%.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. See our latest analysis for CR Capital Real Estate Does CR Capital Real Estate Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 15.41 that there is some investor optimism about CR Capital Real Estate. As you can see below, CR Capital Real Estate has a higher P/E than the average company (13.4) in the real estate industry.XTRA:CRZK Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreCR Capital Real Estate's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.It's nice to see that CR Capital Real Estate grew EPS by a stonking 32% in the last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 65% per year over the last five years. So we'd generally expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.How Does CR Capital Real Estate's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Net debt totals just 3.5% of CR Capital Real Estate's market cap. So it doesn't have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.The Verdict On CR Capital Real Estate's P/E RatioCR Capital Real Estate's P/E is 15.4 which is below average (20.8) in the DE market. The company does have a little debt, and EPS growth was good last year. The low P/E ratio suggests current market expectations are muted, implying these levels of growth will not continue. Because analysts are predicting more growth in the future, one might have expected to see a higher P/E ratio. You can take a closer look at the fundamentals, here. What is very clear is that the market has become more optimistic about CR Capital Real Estate over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 11.8 back then to 15.4 today. If you like to buy stocks that have recently impressed the market, then this one might be a candidate; but if you prefer to invest when there is 'blood in the streets', then you may feel the opportunity has passed.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
