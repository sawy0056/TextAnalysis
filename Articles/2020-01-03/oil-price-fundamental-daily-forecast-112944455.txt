However, keep in mind the performance is deceiving because the move took place after a steep drop in prices between October and December 2018.At 11:04 GMT, February WTI crude oil futures are trading at $61.12, up $0.07 or +0.10% and March Brent crude oil is at $66.23, up $0.23 or +0.35%.2020 ForecastIn 2020, Brent is forecast to average $63.07 a barrel, up from December’s estimate of $62.50, while WTI is forecast to average $57.70 a barrel, up from December’s estimate of $57.30, as the OPEC-led supply cuts and the expectations of a U.S.-China trade deal boosted analysts’ views on the prospects for the year, a Reuters poll showed.Deeper Production Cuts Began January 1As promised in late November/early December, OPEC and its allies, including Russia have begun cutting another 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, on top of their previous cut of 1.2 million bpd that started on January 1, 2019.Trade Deal UpdateU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal would be signed on January 15 at the White House.

Traders are looking for a draw of 3.1 million barrels.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a drop in U.S. crude stocks by 7.8 million barrels in the week ended December 27, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 3.2 million barrels.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
