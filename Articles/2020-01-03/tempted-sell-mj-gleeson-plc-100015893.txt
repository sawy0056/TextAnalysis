All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does MJ Gleeson Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that MJ Gleeson has a higher P/E than the average (11.9) P/E for companies in the consumer durables industry.LSE:GLE Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreMJ Gleeson's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.MJ Gleeson's earnings per share grew by -9.8% in the last twelve months. And earnings per share have improved by 13% annually, over the last five years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.MJ Gleeson's Balance SheetSince MJ Gleeson holds net cash of UK£30m, it can spend on growth, justifying a higher P/E ratio than otherwise.The Bottom Line On MJ Gleeson's P/E RatioMJ Gleeson has a P/E of 15.5.
