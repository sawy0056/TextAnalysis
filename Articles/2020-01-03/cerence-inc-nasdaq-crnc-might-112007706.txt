(NASDAQ:CRNC) to determine whether it could have potential as an investment idea.

Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Cerence:0.027 = US$36m ÷ (US$1.5b - US$129m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, Cerence has an ROCE of 2.7%.

To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Cerence has total liabilities of US$129m and total assets of US$1.5b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 8.7% of its total assets. Cerence has very few current liabilities, which have a minimal effect on its already low ROCE.The Bottom Line On Cerence's ROCEStill, investors could probably find more attractive prospects with better performance out there.
