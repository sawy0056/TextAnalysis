But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the IRLAB Therapeutics AB (publ) (STO:IRLAB A) share price is down 41% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market return of 34%. Because IRLAB Therapeutics hasn't been listed for many years, the market is still learning about how the business performs. Contrary to the longer term story, the last month has been good for stockholders, with a share price gain of 9.3%. But this could be related to good market conditions, with stocks up around 4.5% during the period. Check out our latest analysis for IRLAB Therapeutics IRLAB Therapeutics recorded just kr606,000 in revenue over the last twelve months, which isn't really enough for us to consider it to have a proven product. You have to wonder why venture capitalists aren't funding it. As a result, we think it's unlikely shareholders are paying much attention to current revenue, but rather speculating on growth in the years to come. It seems likely some shareholders believe that IRLAB Therapeutics will significantly advance the business plan before too long.As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. There is usually a significant chance that they will need more money for business development, putting them at the mercy of capital markets. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt.IRLAB Therapeutics had cash in excess of all liabilities of just kr46m when it last reported (September 2019). So if it hasn't remedied the situation already, it will almost certainly have to raise more capital soon. That probably explains why the share price is down 41% in the last year .

There's no way to know its value easily. Given that situation, would you be concerned if it turned out insiders were relentlessly selling stock? I would feel more nervous about the company if that were so. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.A Different PerspectiveWhile IRLAB Therapeutics shareholders are down 41% for the year, the market itself is up 34%. While the aim is to do better than that, it's worth recalling that even great long-term investments sometimes underperform for a year or more. The share price decline has continued throughout the most recent three months, down 0.4%, suggesting an absence of enthusiasm from investors. Basically, most investors should be wary of buying into a poor-performing stock, unless the business itself has clearly improved. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.
