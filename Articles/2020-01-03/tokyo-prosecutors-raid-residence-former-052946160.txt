He has deep ties to Lebanon, the country of his childhood, where his investments include a stake in a bank, real estate and a vineyard.Sources close to Ghosn said he met with Lebanese President Michel Aoun shortly after arriving to Beirut and was greeted warmly, though the presidency denied such a meeting took place.Speaking to broadcaster MTV, caretaker defense minister Elias Bou Saab said Lebanon played no official role in Ghosn's exit from Japan.Turkish police on Thursday detained seven people, including four pilots, as part of an investigation into Ghosn's passage through the country, a police spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman said the other detainees were two airport ground staff and one cargo worker, and all seven were expected to give statements in court on Thursday.Flight tracking data suggests Ghosn used two different planes to fly to Istanbul and then to Lebanon.TRIAL DELAYEDThe sources close to Ghosn said he was prompted to flee after a recent court session in which he learned that the second of two trials would be delayed until April 2021."They said they needed another whole year to prepare for it. ... He was distressed about not being able to see or speak to his wife," one of the sources close to Ghosn said.A request to see or speak to his wife over Christmas was also denied, the sources added, part of strict conditions set on his bail.The sources said Ghosn had grown distressed that authorities were pressuring his family to draw a confession from him after his daughter and son were questioned by Japanese prosecutors in the United States in early December.In just his second public comment since landing in Beirut, Ghosn said in a statement his family played no role whatsoever in his exit from Japan."I alone arranged for my departure," he said.Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 and faces four charges for alleged financial crimes including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to car dealerships in the Middle East. He denies the charges.Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Thursday Japanese authorities allowed Ghosn to carry a spare French passport in a locked case while out on bail, potentially shedding some light on how he managed to escape despite having passports held by Japanese lawyers.No one was immediately available for comment at the office of Ghosn's lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, at the French embassy in Tokyo, or at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.Nissan ousted him as chairman, saying internal investigations revealed misconduct including understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.(Reporting by Samia Nakhoul, Laila Bassam and Kiyoshi Takenaka; Writing by Eric Knecht/Tom Perry; Editing by David Dolan, Jane Merriman, Giles Elgood, William Maclean and Will Dunham)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; WHO Sees ‘Decisive’ Stage: Virus UpdateBloombergLimited Virus Testing in Japan Masks True Scale of InfectionBloombergWorld prepares for coronavirus pandemic; global recession forecastReutersStocks Tumble as Fear Envelops Asia; Yen Rises: Markets WrapBloombergVirus threat to Olympics casts shadow over marathon trialsAssociated PressRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
