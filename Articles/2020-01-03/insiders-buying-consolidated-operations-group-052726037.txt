On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Consolidated Operations Group Limited (ASX:COG).What Is Insider Buying?Most investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Harvard University study found that 'insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year. Check out our latest analysis for Consolidated Operations Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Consolidated Operations GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Executive Director and Head of Finance Broking & Aggregation Cameron McCullagh for AU$81k worth of shares, at about AU$0.091 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than AU$0.089 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Cameron McCullagh was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.Cameron McCullagh bought a total of 1.22m shares over the year at an average price of AU$0.089.

Independent Non-Executive Director Stephen White divested only AU$19k worth of shares in that time. It's not great to see insider selling, nor the lack of recent buyers. But the selling simply isn't sufficiently substantial to be of much use as a signal.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. From looking at our data, insiders own AU$5.1m worth of Consolidated Operations Group stock, about 3.6% of the company. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. We consider this fairly low insider ownership.So What Does This Data Suggest About Consolidated Operations Group Insiders?Story continuesWhile there has not been any insider buying in the last three months, there has been selling.
