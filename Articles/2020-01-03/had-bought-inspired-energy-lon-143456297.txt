And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Inspired Energy PLC (LON:INSE) share price is up 85% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 13% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 22% , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for Inspired Energy There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Inspired Energy managed to grow its earnings per share at 8.2% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).AIM:INSE Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreWe know that Inspired Energy has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Inspired Energy will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Inspired Energy, it has a TSR of 117% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveInspired Energy shareholders have received returns of 22% over twelve months (even including dividends) , which isn't far from the general market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 17% per year. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. Importantly, we haven't analysed Inspired Energy's dividend history.
