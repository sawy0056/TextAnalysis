But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the IFA Hotel & Touristik Aktiengesellschaft (FRA:IFA) share price is up 24% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. In comparison, the share price is down 3.7% in a year. Check out our latest analysis for IFA Hotel & Touristik In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.IFA Hotel & Touristik's earnings per share are down 3.7% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.With EPS falling, but a modestly increasing share price, it seems that the market was probably too pessimistic about the stock in the past. Having said that, if the EPS falls continue we'd be surprised to see a sustained increase in share price.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).DB:IFA Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreThis free interactive report on IFA Hotel & Touristik's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for IFA Hotel & Touristik the TSR over the last 5 years was 35%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIFA Hotel & Touristik shareholders are down 2.1% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 23%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 6.2%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.
