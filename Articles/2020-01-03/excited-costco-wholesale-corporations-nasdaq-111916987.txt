By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).Our data shows Costco Wholesale has a return on equity of 23% for the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated $0.23 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Costco Wholesale How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Costco Wholesale:23% = US$3.8b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does Return On Equity Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, all else being equal, a high ROE is better than a low one. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does Costco Wholesale Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Costco Wholesale has a superior ROE than the average (12%) company in the Consumer Retailing industry.NasdaqGS:COST Past Revenue and Net Income, January 2nd 2020MoreThat's what I like to see. I usually take a closer look when a company has a better ROE than industry peers. One data point to check is if insiders have bought shares recently.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining Costco Wholesale's Debt And Its 23% Return On EquityCostco Wholesale has a debt to equity ratio of 0.42, which is far from excessive. The combination of modest debt and a very impressive ROE does suggest that the business is high quality. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company's ability to take advantage of future opportunities.But It's Just One MetricReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
