But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Oriola Oyj (HEL:OKDBV) shareholders, since the share price is down 54% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 27%. View our latest analysis for Oriola Oyj To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Oriola Oyj saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 70% per year, over the last three years. In comparison the 23% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. This suggests that the market retains some optimism around long term earnings stability, despite past EPS declines. This positive sentiment is also reflected in the generous P/E ratio of 306.12.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).HLSE:OKDBV Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Oriola Oyj's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Oriola Oyj the TSR over the last 3 years was -48%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveOriola Oyj shareholders gained a total return of 2.0% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 6.5% endured over half a decade. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around.
