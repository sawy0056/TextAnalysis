By the end of the latest week, the number of new claims was at its lowest since the Nov. 30 week.Labor market strength is underpinning consumer spending, keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite headwinds from trade tensions and slowing global growth that have weighed on manufacturing.In November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, the lowest in nearly half a century.Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 5,000 to 1.73 million for the week ended Dec. 21.(Reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Andrea Ricci)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersDurables, Jobless Claims Ignored on Coronavirus FearsZacksOne million Britons will be on zero-hour contracts by end of 2020The ConversationU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth-quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersWRAPUP 2-U.S. economy grows steadily in Q4, but coronavirus looms largeReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
