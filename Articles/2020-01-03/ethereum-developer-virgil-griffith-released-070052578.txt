Griffith previously ignored official warnings not to travel to the dictatorship. Despite the severity of the charges against Griffith, fellow developer Vitalik Buterin voiced his support for his close friend and colleague at the time, saying he refused to “take the convenient path of throwing Virgil under the bus’.’ Initial trial and bailAs reported by Coin Rivet in December, Griffith was arrested upon his return to the USA following a joint investigation by the FBI and the Department of Justice’s National Security Division.  Reporting from inside the courtroom on the December 30 hearing, independent journalist Inner City Press tweeted that the prosecution thought Griffith was a potential flight risk and that his conference speech was produced directly for the North Korean regime – not for the ‘private economy’.  AUSA Kraus: In North Korea, there is no private economy. Conference was by and for regime.
Another senior AUSA walks in. Inner City Press: Where's US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman? — Inner City Press (@innercitypress) December 30, 2019 One of the most worrying factors for the prosecution and national security experts, was Griffith’s apparent distaste for the American way of life and his citizenship of the USA. Griffith’s lawyer, Klein, admitted his client was considering voluntarily renouncing his US citizenship, and also moving to the Caribbean island of St Kitts, but decided not to pursue either. Klein said Griffith was “verbose and provocative”, but hasn’t been charged with serious criminal offenes such as money laundering. Judge Broderick, presiding, hit back at Griffith’s self-proclaimed love for North Korea, saying: “If you were in North Korea, you wouldn’t be having a bond hearing”.Eventually, Griffith was granted bail at $1 million. Griffith’s father offered his house as security for bond, worth $835,000, and it’s believed Griffith’s sister also secured the bond with her own property. Griffith’s father was in attendance at court. It was also reported that Griffith has been suspended from his duties at the Ethereum Foundation, although the organisation had remained supportive of his case.  The post Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith released on $1 million bail appeared first on Coin Rivet.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Virus Threat Puts Expected Trump-Kim Face-Off on HoldBloombergUN prepared to make humanitarian exemptions for N.
