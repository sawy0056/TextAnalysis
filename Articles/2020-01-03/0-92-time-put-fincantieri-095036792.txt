(BIT:FCT) On Your Watch List?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosFincantieri S.p.A. (BIT:FCT), which is in the machinery business, and is based in Italy, saw significant share price movement during recent months on the BIT, rising to highs of €0.98 and falling to the lows of €0.85. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Fincantieri's current trading price of €0.92 reflective of the actual value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Fincantieri’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Fincantieri Is Fincantieri still cheap?Fincantieri appears to be overvalued by 23% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at €0.92 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of €0.75. This means that the opportunity to buy Fincantieri at a good price has disappeared! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Fincantieri’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Fincantieri?BIT:FCT Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Fincantieri. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? FCT’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell?

If you’ve been keeping tabs on FCT for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing.
