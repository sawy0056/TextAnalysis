Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether First American Financial's current trading price of US$58.32 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap?

According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $103.35, but it is currently trading at US$58.32 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now.
