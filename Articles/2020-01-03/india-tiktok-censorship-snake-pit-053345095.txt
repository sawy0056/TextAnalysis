This is perhaps unsurprising considering over 40% of TikTok’s userbase hails from the country alone.“We take any request from government bodies extremely seriously, and closely review each such request we receive to determine whether, for example, the request adheres to the required legal process or the content violates local law,” the ByteDance-owned company wrote in its report.The UK’s first black royal has already walked awayThe Chinese short-video app has continuously come under the scanner for harassment, perverse content, and child-privacy violations, among other things, in India. Not all legal requests were entirely valid, though. TikTok only furnished some information in less than half the cases in India. “Any information request we receive is carefully reviewed for legal sufficiency, to determine whether, for example, the requesting entity is authorised to gather evidence in connection with a law enforcement investigation or to investigate an emergency involving imminent harm,” the firm said.In addition to legal information requests, government bodies sometimes request that TikTok remove content they deem to be a violation of local laws.Only nine countries asked TikTok to remove content last year, and India topped the list. There were 11 such instances in the country this year, resulting in eight account removals and four instances of content being either removed or restricted. Sign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world’s most important and interesting news.More stories from Quartz:Chinese nationals caught surveilling same US military base twice in 2 weeksAs India rises in dissent, Bollywood reveals its real heroes: the womenReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump campaign ads target a new audience: Indian AmericansPoliticoUS urges India to allow peaceful assembly after riotsAFPA Delhi neighborhood divided by a highway and now hatredReutersReddit CEO claims TikTok app is 'fundamentally parasitic' and spywareUSA TODAYIndia’s Fragile Economic Rebound Faces New Risk From CoronavirusBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
