The substantial number of requests reflects the need for improved broadband throughout the state, and it reflects highly on the quality of Redzone's fixed wireless Internet service as an attractive alternative to broadband provided by cable and telephone.Redzone is the Highest Customer Rated Broadband Service Provider in Maine"I congratulate the entire Redzone team for an outstanding year of progress," said Jim McKenna, Redzone President & CEO. "We've significantly expanded the reach of our broadband services, and made substantial investments in network infrastructure this year. Our customers consistently share their positive service quality and reliability experiences, and we take particular pride in receiving the highest Google customer ratings of any Internet provider in Maine."Positive Response in Rural Maine Communities"We've been striving to bring additional players into the broadband market to provide competition and it is good to see the market growing. We wish Redzone success in their efforts to expand services," said Tom Bartell, Executive Director of Windham Economic Development Corporation"Norridgewock welcomes Redzone Wireless into the community as a Maine-owned internet provider. Many rural Maine communities are left with inadequate internet service and Redzone is helping to bridge that gap while providing consumers with greater options. We are pleased that this Maine-owned company has chosen Norridgewock as one of its recent expansion markets and look forward to Redzone providing Norridgewock businesses and families with quality, affordable internet service," said Richard A. LaBelle, Norridgewock Town Manager"The new expansion of Redzone into Skowhegan brings new internet provider competition, which in the end will improve service to everyone in the region. We are happy to see this new expansion into Skowhegan" said Jeff Hewett Director of Economic & Community Development in the Town of Skowhegan"We are thrilled that Redzone Wireless has expanded its service to the Gardiner/Randolph area. The ability to access high quality broadband gives businesses in the area the opportunity to harness technology to their benefit and grow and sustain a successful business. It is also a great development for the region as a whole with everyone who lives, works, and plays here," said Katie Doherty, President & CEO Kennebec Valley ChamberRedzone Fixed Wireless Technology is a Rural Broadband Game ChangerRedzone has disrupted the conventional model for delivering broadband access via cable, wire or fiber by extending Maine's existing fiber optic infrastructure wirelessly. Redzone uses powerful Gigabit "backhaul" radios to connect clusters of towers to individual fiber optic circuits, and delivers broadband services to homes via LTE and 5G technology transmitted on FCC-licensed 2.5 GHz spectrum.This innovative approach has reduced broadband network capital costs by 90%, and accelerated the delivery timeframe to a few months versus the multiple years commonly required to complete comparable fiber-to-the-home networks.Story continues2019 Local Community SupportIn addition to expanding rural broadband in Maine, Redzone substantially increased its level of community support. The company adopted 7 regional Animal Shelters through it's 2019 Broadband for Pet People program, provided free broadband to Fire Departments, supported Youth Sports and Creative Arts, and subsidized Internet connectivity for Maine Seniors. Redzone was proud to contribute to these organizations, programs and individuals that are so vital to the communities we serve.Highlighted 2019 Program - Redzone's Broadband for Pet PeopleSupported Animal Welfare Organizations & Areas Served-PAWS Animal Adoption Center - Camden/Rockport -Humane Society Waterville Area - Waterville/Fairfield -Franklin County Animal Shelter - Farmington/New Sharon -Bangor Humane Society - Bangor -Kennebec Valley Humane Society - Augusta/Randolph -Greater Androscoggin Humane Society - Lewiston/Auburn -Another Chance Animal Rescue - Sanford/AlfredIn 2019, these incredible organizations, predominantly supported by local volunteers, have provided temporary refuge - including food, shelter, veterinary care, and love to more than 15,000 homeless animals, reunited thousands of lost pets with their owners, and created thousands of new families through responsible pet adoption.Closing Maine's Broadband GapAccording to The ConnectME Authority, Maine's publicly funded organization dedicated to improving broadband within the state, Maine's digital divide is comprised of 80,000 locations around the state that lack access to 25 Mbps broadband service. Redzone estimates that it has narrowed Maine's broadband gap by 10%, with new access provided to 8,000 previously underserved locations as a result of completing its 2019 expansion."It is beyond gratifying to connect so many Maine families and businesses to true broadband - in many cases for the first time, while also working to make a positive impact in the local communities where our customers and employees live and work," said Michael Forcillo, Executive Vice President of Redzone Wireless. "Broadband connectivity is an essential service for individuals, particularly in rural Maine communities. Redzone is committed to leveling the digital playing field so all Mainers have every possible opportunity to benefit from affordable broadband connectivity."Media Contact:Michael Forcillo website: http://www.redzonewireless.com email: PressMedia@redzonewireless.com phone: 207-596-5700Redzone Wireless, LLC, established in 2014, is deploying an FCC licensed 4G LTE and 5G fixed wireless broadband network across Maine.
