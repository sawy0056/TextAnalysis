By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Intelligent Systems Corporation (NYSEMKT:INS).Intelligent Systems has a ROE of 29%, based on the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated $0.29 in profit. View our latest analysis for Intelligent Systems How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Intelligent Systems:29% = US$9.7m ÷ US$33m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. A higher profit will lead to a higher ROE. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does Intelligent Systems Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Intelligent Systems has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Software industry.AMEX:INS Past Revenue and Net Income, January 2nd 2020MoreThat's clearly a positive. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. For example, I often check if insiders have been buying shares.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Intelligent Systems's Debt And Its 29% ROEOne positive for shareholders is that Intelligent Systems does not have any net debt! Its impressive ROE suggests it is a high quality business, but it's even better to have achieved that without leverage. After all, when a company has a strong balance sheet, it can often find ways to invest in growth, even if it takes some time.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
