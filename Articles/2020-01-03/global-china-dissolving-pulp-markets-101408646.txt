In 2018, 1.07 million tons of wood pulp, or 68.6% of China's total dissolving pulp output, was produced, up by 1.9% on an annualized basis; the output of cotton & bamboo pulp and modified pulp reduced by 8.6% and 15.0%, respectively. By price: due to China-US trade tensions (China imposed additional tariffs of 5% on dissolving pulp originating from the United States; China and the United States placed additional 25% tariffs on viscose staple fiber originating from each other), Chinese dissolving pulp (wood pulp) price has presented a choppy downtrend since the second half of 2018, nose-diving to around RMB6,500/ton in the first half of 2019, compared with over RMB7,500/ton in 2018. By application: viscose staple fiber uses the most dissolving pulp. China's output of viscose staple fiber jumped by 7.6% over the previous year to virtually 3.95 million tons in 2018, showing a CAGR of 11.6% between 2008 and 2018. The continued expansion of viscose staple fiber capacity and the release of downstream cellulose fiber capacity in the forthcoming years will favor solid growth in the viscose staple fiber output of the country. By competitive pattern: globally, key dissolving pulp producers are Sappi (South Africa), Bracell (Brazil), Lenzing (Australia), and some Chinese companies like Shandong Sun Paper Industry Joint Stock Co., Ltd., Asia Symbol (Shandong) Pulp & Paper Co., Ltd., Hunan Juntai New Material Technology Co., Ltd. and Fujian Qingshan Paper Industry Co., Ltd.
