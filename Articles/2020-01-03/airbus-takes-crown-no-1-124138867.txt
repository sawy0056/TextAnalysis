A company spokesperson declined to comment on the unaudited figures.Chicago-based Boeing, meanwhile, saw deliveries plunge after 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people. Shipments through November totaled 345 jets, down 51 percent from a year ago.Boeing’s numbers are likely to continue suffering since the planemaker has frozen production of the Max as it works to obtain Federal Aviation Administration approval for the aircraft to resume commercial flights. The agency is evaluating a patch for anti-stall software that investigators linked to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.The number of deliveries is important for planemakers’ bottom lines as they receive the bulk of their payments upon when they turn jets over to airline customers. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSAirbus shares gained 55.4 percent in 2019 while Boeing shares were up 1 percent.Related ArticlesBest Buy Celebrates 50 Yrs With Saleathon; Will It Turn 60?Canadian Solar Is Facing More Challenges Than It AppearsTarget Adds Private Bathrooms to Quell Transgender DebateReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBoeing airplanes boss earns big stock award after strong launch of new divisionAmerican City Business JournalsP&G veteran tapped for C-suite at BoeingAmerican City Business JournalsGovernment leaders talk layoff response and building Wichita’s future to Emerging LeadersAmerican City Business JournalsCanada mulling made-in-Ottawa supplement to Boeing's 737 MAX flight manualReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
