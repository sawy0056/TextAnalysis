The magic of ACTIVA Presto is in the resin, which is moisture-friendly and facilitates the diffusion of bioavailable calcium, phosphate and fluoride ions. "It's acting just like a tooth," explains Larry Clark, Director of Clinical Affairs at Pulpdent, "it's giving off and taking back ions." This unique chemistry penetrates and integrates with tooth structure for margin-free adaptation. The material also contains a patented rubberized-resin that absorbs stress and resists wear, fracture, and chipping, even in thin areas on bevel margins.ACTIVA Presto is a stackable composite that holds its shape and will not slump. Dentist and popular lecturer Dr. Howard Glazer describes the product as "squirt and shoot" technology in a recent interview.Watch interview with Dr. Howard Glazer. This versatile material is indicated for all classes of cavities and comes in a variety of shades, including cervical shades A4 and A6, which are ideal for older patients.
