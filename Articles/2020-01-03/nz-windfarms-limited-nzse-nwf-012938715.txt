Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for NZ Windfarms:0.11 = NZ$5.7m ÷ (NZ$55m - NZ$1.9m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, NZ Windfarms has an ROCE of 11%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. You can check if NZ Windfarms has cyclical profits by looking at this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.Do NZ Windfarms's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Current liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.NZ Windfarms has total assets of NZ$55m and current liabilities of NZ$1.9m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 3.4% of its total assets. In addition to low current liabilities (making a negligible impact on ROCE), NZ Windfarms earns a sound return on capital employed.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On NZ Windfarms's ROCEIf NZ Windfarms can continue reinvesting in its business, it could be an attractive prospect.
