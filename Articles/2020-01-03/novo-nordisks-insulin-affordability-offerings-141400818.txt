"That's why today, we have made available additional options recognizing the different situations that make insulin unaffordable or inaccessible. With these programs, in conjunction with NNI's investment in rebates to ensure our medicines are on formularies, we are continuing to take action to help people with diabetes afford their insulin as we work toward much needed longer-term change."Expanded affordability options now available My$99Insulin: For $99, you can get up to three vials or two packs of FlexPen®/FlexTouch®/PenFill® pens of any combination of Novo Nordisk Inc. insulins.
