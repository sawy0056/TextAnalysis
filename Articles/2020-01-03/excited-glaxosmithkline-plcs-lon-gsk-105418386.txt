This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine GlaxoSmithKline plc (LON:GSK), by way of a worked example.Our data shows GlaxoSmithKline has a return on equity of 28% for the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every £1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn £0.28. View our latest analysis for GlaxoSmithKline How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for GlaxoSmithKline:28% = UK£5.1b ÷ UK£18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does GlaxoSmithKline Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, GlaxoSmithKline has a better ROE than the average (12%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry.LSE:GSK Past Revenue and Net Income, January 2nd 2020MoreThat is a good sign. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. One data point to check is if insiders have bought shares recently.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining GlaxoSmithKline's Debt And Its 28% Return On EquityGlaxoSmithKline does use a significant amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.83. I think the ROE is impressive, but it would have been assisted by the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
