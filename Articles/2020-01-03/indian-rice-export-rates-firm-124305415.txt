If it persists for long, crops will be affected," he said.Two cold spells hit the country over the past two weeks and another is expected in a few days.Thailand’s rice-trading market was closed for most of the week because of the New Year holidays.(Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav in Mumbai, Ruma Paul in Dhaka, Phuong Nguyen in Hanoi and Patpicha Tanakasempipat in Bangkok; Editing by David Goodman)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
