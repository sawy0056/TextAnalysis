Carolyn Moos & Sharon Kleyne discuss drinking water, breath, sleep, exercise & eating healthy for longer life.GRANTS PASS, Ore., Jan. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Air Date: 30 December 2019Guest: Carolyn Moos, Certified personal trainer, yoga instructor and nutrition consultant, Californiahttps://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/120678/how-to-stay-healthy-and-fit-during-the-holidays USA Basketball Junior Olympics gold medalist and former Stanford University and FIBA/WNBA basketball player Carolyn Moos doesn't believe in the word discipline. "There is a difference between discipline and desire," says Moos, currently a certified personal trainer, yoga instructor and nutrition consultant in California.Joining Sharon Kleyne, host of the internationally syndicated radio program, The Sharon Kleyne Hour Water Life Science®/Nature's Pharma®, The Power of Water® & Your Health sponsored by Nature's Tears® EyeMist® on VoiceAmerica and produced by Rose Hong, founder and director of Global Dragon TV in Washington, D.C., Moos explains that, "if you feel like you're being disciplined or disciplining yourself, that never works. I believe in finding the passion, the desire. The work ethic will follow."Kleyne sees the need for improved education. "I've been in water evaporation research every day for the last thirty-five years," says Kleyne, "and I'm fascinated by the lack of good health education not only in the U.S. but all over the world. It's an attitude about health that lacks common sense!" Kleyne is focused on helping others become more proactive about their health with common sense education. "We forget what this life is all about," says Kleyne. "The gift is living on this planet. Life is water. Life is living with the rhythm of earth and the solar system and breathing earth's precious watery atmosphere. What is climate change? It's sand changing the atmosphere."Moos, who traveled the world playing professional basketball, first in France, then with Miami of the WNBA, shares her daily mantra: hydration, nutrition, no alcohol or drugs, eight hours of sleep, breath work, early to bed, early to rise. "Have a water bottle with you at all times," says Moos, who recalls when teaching middle school fifty percent of her students were dehydrated. "I drink water all day long. Water is the only liquid I put in my body."Kleyne, who shares that she remembers the beginning popularity of the water bottle, stresses learning to breathe through the study of Qigong and Tai Chi. Kleyne honors Moos's supportive parents who gave their daughter freedom to choose and to ask good questions. Kleyne encourages parents of all ages to get on the ball and become better educated about health, then teach those practices to children.In her current practice, Moos reveals that she is, "a big fan of teaching people, not just doing things for them." Moos teaches yoga, nutrition and weight room cardiovascular work to people of all ages, children (teaching basketball skills) and pregnant women. "The number one thing for nutrition," says Moos, "is to get a strategic macronutrient profile work-up. This measures the ratios of proteins, carbohydrates and fat in a diet." Moos, who teaches in person and via Skype, explains that, "protein contains amino acids that facilitate muscle repair, carbs give you glucose for brain power and good fats are important for the health of organs, hair and nails. I also love to teach people how to utilize oxygen in the most efficient way.""We need more education like that," says Kleyne. "The moment a baby is born, a lifelong natural evaporation process begins. So does the need to learn throughout life about steps that must be taken to ensure good health through a long, productive and happy life."*If you would like to listen to the program featuring gold medalist, Stanford graduate, FIBA/WNBA professional basketball player, certified personal fitness trainer, nutritionist and yoga teacher Carolyn Moos and educator and evaporative dry eye researcher Sharon Kleyne as they talk about hydration, water evaporation, nutrition, mental health, breathing and sleep techniques and working out, you may do so by following this link: https://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/120678/how-to-stay-healthy-and-fit-during-the-holidays If you wish to see a brief educational film that demonstrates the application of the new Dry Eye Solution® technology Nature's Tears® EyeMist®, go here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0gOr8TB45USOURCE Kleyne Talk RadioReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTry This Personal Trainer’s Self-Motivating Tips For Getting to the GymPopSugarTichina Arnold Gets Peed On By Goat During Goat Yoga On 'Lilly Singh'HuffPostThe best stretching equipment to ensure that you don't wake up tomorrow in painGolf DigestYour Yoga Session Can Banish Lower Back Pain Just as Well as Meds CanBicyclingCelebs Go Dating viewers react to Amy Childs' 'awkward' and 'cringe' kissDigital SpyRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
