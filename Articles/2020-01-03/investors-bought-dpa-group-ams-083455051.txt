But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term DPA Group N.V. (AMS:DPA) shareholders, since the share price is down 13% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 36%. Check out our latest analysis for DPA Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, DPA Group actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 29% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.It's strange to see such muted share price performance despite sustained growth. Perhaps a clue lies in other metrics. Therefore, we should look at some other metrics to try to understand why the market is disappointed.Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market. We like that DPA Group has actually grown its revenue over the last three years. But it's not clear to us why the share price is down. It might be worth diving deeper into the fundamentals, lest an opportunity goes begging.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).ENXTAM:DPA Income Statement, January 2nd 2020MoreWe know that DPA Group has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store?

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of DPA Group, it has a TSR of -2.8% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveDPA Group shareholders gained a total return of 10% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 0.7% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time.
