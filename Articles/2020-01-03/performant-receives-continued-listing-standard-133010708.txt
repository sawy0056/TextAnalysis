A robust diversified business with strong healthcare growth has emerged from a legacy business of “large government education contracts”. We have done this through both organic growth and through the acquisition of Premiere—which allows us to accelerate our business in commercial recovery and revenue cycle management. We planned on and continue to expect that we will see positive EBITDA in Q4 of 2019, which we believe will lead to revenue growth and positive EBITDA in 2020.”“We thank our existing shareholders for their continued support, and we look forward to executing toward our revenue growth and positive EBITDA,” continued Im.In accordance with applicable NASDAQ procedures, the Company plans to notify NASDAQ in a timely manner that it intends to pursue actions to meet the minimum average share price requirement. The NASDAQ letter indicates that the Company will be provided 180 calendar days, or until June 24, 2020, to regain compliance with the minimum $1.00 per share bid requirement. The letter further indicates that the Company may regain compliance with the Rule if at any time before June 24, 2020, should the bid price of the Company's common stock close at $1.00 per share or above for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. The notice has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company’s common stock, which will continue to trade on the NASDAQ subject to the Company’s compliance with the other continued listing requirements.About Performant Financial Corporation                                                        Performant Financial Corporation is a leading provider of technology-enabled recovery and related analytics services.
