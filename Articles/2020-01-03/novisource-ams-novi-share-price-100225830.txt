But no-one is immune from buying too high. For example the Novisource N.V. (AMS:NOVI) share price dropped 63% over five years. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. Unhappily, the share price slid 4.5% in the last week. Check out our latest analysis for Novisource To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Novisource became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.It could be that the revenue decline of 16% per year is viewed as evidence that Novisource is shrinking. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).ENXTAM:NOVI Income Statement, January 2nd 2020MoreIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on Novisource's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Novisource's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Novisource hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of -61% exceeds its share price return of -63%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.A Different PerspectiveNovisource shareholders have received returns of 24% over twelve months, which isn't far from the general market return. The silver lining is that the share price is up in the short term, which flies in the face of the annualised loss of 17% over the last five years. We're pretty skeptical of turnaround stories, but it's good to see the recent share price recovery.
