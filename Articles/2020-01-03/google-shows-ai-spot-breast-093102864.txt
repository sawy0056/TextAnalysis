The system reduced false positives by 5.7% in the U.S., according to data from more than 28,000 mammograms performed there and in the U.K.Artificial intelligence is particularly good at reading scans, often outperforming experts. Last year, Google published research that showed how the technology could be used to tell whether breast cancer had spread to surrounding lymph nodes, helping pathologists make more accurate diagnoses.Google is also training artificial intelligence to help determine whether a patient is likely to live or die, mining thousands of data points to help make predictions about outcomes.Read more about Google’s medical research here.Still, the company found it has to tread carefully when using patient data. In 2017, British regulators said Alphabet’s artificial intelligence unit, DeepMind, violated U.K. data-protection law when it tested an app that analyzed public medical records without telling patients how their information would be used.The initial findings for the breast cancer study were published in the journal Nature. The research was done in partnership with DeepMind as well as Cancer Research U.K. Imperial Centre, Northwestern University and Royal Surrey County Hospital, the company said in the blog.To contact the reporter on this story: Amy Thomson in London at athomson6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Marthe Fourcade, John LauermanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLimited Virus Testing in Japan Masks True Scale of InfectionBloombergOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergChina Stock Option’s 2,800% Surge Shows Rush for HedgesBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2014 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergDell Projects Profit That Falls Short of Estimates on PC WarningBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
