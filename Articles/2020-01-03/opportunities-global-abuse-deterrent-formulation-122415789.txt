Based on likely licensing deal structures and agreements that are expected to be signed between drug and technology developers in the foreseen future, we have provided an informed estimate on the likely evolution of the market for the period 2019-2030.The report features likely distribution of the current and forecasted financial opportunity across:[A] target drug class (opioids, antidepressants and CNS stimulants)[B] abuse deterrence approach (physical / chemical barriers, agonist / antagonist combinations, aversion approach, prodrug approach, abuse-deterrent drug delivery systems and others)[C] type of end product (tablets, capsules, transdermal patches, thin films and others)[D] geography (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and the rest of the world)Amongst other elements, the report features:A detailed assessment of the current market landscape of companies offering technologies for the development of abuse-deterrent formulations of prescription drugs that are prone to be misused, including information on key technology developers (such as year of establishment, company size, and geographical location), and their respective technologies, offering insights on current status of development (available for use and under development), target drug class (opioids, antidepressants and CNS stimulants), abuse deterrence approach (physical and chemical barriers, prodrug approach, use of agonist / antagonist, aversion, use of specific drug delivery systems, and others), disrupted route of abuse (parenteral, insufflation, covert administration, oral, and others), type of end product (tablets, capsules, transdermal patches, thin films, and others), and release characteristics (delayed / extended, controlled, immediate, and others).An informed competitiveness analysis of the various abuse-deterrent drug formulation technologies captured in our database, taking into consideration the supplier power (based on year of establishment) and key technology-related specifications, such as the abuse-deterrent approach, disrupted route of abuse, number of products available / under development using a particular technology and strength of intellectual property portfolio (in terms of number of affiliated patents).Elaborate profiles of prominent technology developers engaged in this domain, featuring an overview of the company, its financial information (if available), and a detailed description of proprietary technology/technologies. Each profile also includes a list of recent developments, highlighting the key milestones achieved, partnership activity, and the likely strategies that may be adopted by these players to fuel growth in the foreseen future.An in-depth analysis of the patents that have been filed/granted related to abuse-deterrent formulation technologies, from 2000 to 2019 (till April). The analysis also highlights the key trends associated with these patents, across patent type, regional applicability, CPC classification, emerging focus areas, leading patent assignees (in terms of the number of patents filed/granted), and patent benchmarking.An analysis of the partnerships that have been established in the domain in the period 2013-2019, covering product commercialization and licensing agreements, product development agreements, licensing agreements, mergers/acquisitions, service agreements, research agreements, and others.In order to account for future uncertainties and to add robustness to our model, we have provided three forecast scenarios, portraying the conservative, base and optimistic tracks of the market's evolution.The opinions and insights presented in this study were influenced by discussions conducted with several stakeholders in this domain.
