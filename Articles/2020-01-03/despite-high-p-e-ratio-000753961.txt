We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Foley Family Wines Limited's (NZSE:FWL), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is Foley Family Wines's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 31.94. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 3.1%. View our latest analysis for Foley Family Wines How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Foley Family Wines:P/E of 31.94 = NZ$1.88 ÷ NZ$0.06 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each NZ$1 the company has earned over the last year. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does Foley Family Wines Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (27.1) for companies in the beverage industry is lower than Foley Family Wines's P/E.NZSE:FWL Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Foley Family Wines will outperform other companies in its industry. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Foley Family Wines's 70% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. Regrettably, the longer term performance is poor, with EPS down 10% per year over 5 years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does Foley Family Wines's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Foley Family Wines's net debt equates to 38% of its market capitalization. You'd want to be aware of this fact, but it doesn't bother us.The Verdict On Foley Family Wines's P/E RatioFoley Family Wines trades on a P/E ratio of 31.9, which is above its market average of 19.5. The company is not overly constrained by its modest debt levels, and its recent EPS growth is nothing short of stand-out. So on this analysis a high P/E ratio seems reasonable.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
