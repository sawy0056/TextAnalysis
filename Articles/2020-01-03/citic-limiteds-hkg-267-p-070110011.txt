To keep it practical, we'll show how CITIC Limited's (HKG:267) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. CITIC has a price to earnings ratio of 5.71, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 17.5%. Check out our latest analysis for CITIC How Do You Calculate CITIC's P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for CITIC:P/E of 5.71 = HK$10.42 ÷ HK$1.82 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does CITIC's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see CITIC has a lower P/E than the average (6.5) in the industrials industry classification.SEHK:267 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreCITIC's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Notably, CITIC grew EPS by a whopping 25% in the last year. And it has improved its earnings per share by 25% per year over the last three years. With that performance, I would expect it to have an above average P/E ratio. In contrast, EPS has decreased by 2.1%, annually, over 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.CITIC's Balance SheetThe extra options and safety that comes with CITIC's HK$25b net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.The Bottom Line On CITIC's P/E RatioCITIC has a P/E of 5.7. That's below the average in the HK market, which is 10.6. Not only should the net cash position reduce risk, but the recent growth has been impressive. The below average P/E ratio suggests that market participants don't believe the strong growth will continue.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
