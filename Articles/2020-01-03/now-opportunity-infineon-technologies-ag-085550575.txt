The company's stock led the XTRA gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Infineon Technologies’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Infineon Technologies What is Infineon Technologies worth?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 42%, trading at €20.31 compared to my intrinsic value of €14.33. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Infineon Technologies’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Infineon Technologies look like?XTRA:IFX Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
