Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Dätwyler Holding Inc.

Check out our latest analysis for Dätwyler Holding To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Dätwyler Holding achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 1.1% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 8.8% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).SWX:DAE Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreDive deeper into Dätwyler Holding's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Dätwyler Holding's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Dätwyler Holding the TSR over the last 5 years was 65%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Dätwyler Holding shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 53% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 11% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Is Dätwyler Holding cheap compared to other companies?
