(NYSE:GLOB)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosGlobant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB), which is in the software business, and is based in Luxembourg, saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Globant’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Globant What is Globant worth?Globant appears to be overvalued according to my relative valuation model. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 74.03x is currently well-above the industry average of 44.65x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. In addition to this, it seems like Globant’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What does the future of Globant look like?NYSE:GLOB Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.
