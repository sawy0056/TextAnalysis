Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.In the last five years Cinedigm saw its revenue shrink by 17% per year. That's definitely a weaker result than most pre-profit companies report. So it's not that strange that the share price dropped 46% per year in that period.
