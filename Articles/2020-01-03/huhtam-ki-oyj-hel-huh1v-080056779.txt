Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.While Huhtamäki Oyj's 2.0% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Huhtamäki Oyj! HLSE:HUH1V Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Huhtamäki Oyj paid out 54% of its profit as dividends. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Huhtamäki Oyj paid out 65% of its cash flow as dividends last year, which is within a reasonable range for the average corporation. It's positive to see that Huhtamäki Oyj's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Is Huhtamäki Oyj's Balance Sheet Risky?As Huhtamäki Oyj has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 2.35 times its EBITDA, Huhtamäki Oyj has a noticeable amount of debt, although if business stays steady, this may not be overly concerning.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Huhtamäki Oyj has EBIT of 11.66 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Huhtamäki Oyj's latest financial position,

Huhtamäki Oyj has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €0.34 in 2010, compared to €0.84 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 9.5% per year over this time.Story continuesCompanies like this, growing their dividend at a decent rate, can be very valuable over the long term, if the rate of growth can be maintained.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. It's good to see Huhtamäki Oyj has been growing its earnings per share at 11% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly, but given that it is paying out more than half of its earnings as dividends, we wonder how Huhtamäki Oyj will keep funding its growth projects in the future.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Huhtamäki Oyj's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we think Huhtamäki Oyj is paying out an acceptable percentage of its cashflow and profit. We like that it has been delivering solid improvement in its earnings per share, and relatively consistent dividend payments. Overall we think Huhtamäki Oyj is an interesting dividend stock, although it could be better.Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
