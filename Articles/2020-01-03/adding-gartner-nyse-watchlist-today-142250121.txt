And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Gartner (NYSE:IT). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for Gartner Gartner's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Gartner grew its EPS by 5.9% per year. While that sort of growth rate isn't amazing, it does show the business is growing.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of Gartner's revenue last year was revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note Gartner's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 5.9% to US$4.1b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enormous stake in the company, worth US$452m. This suggests to me that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!Is Gartner Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Gartner is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Just as polish makes silverware pop, the high level of insider ownership enhances my enthusiasm for this growth. That combination appeals to me, for one. So yes, I do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Another important measure of business quality not discussed here, is return on equity (ROE).
