(LON:HYNS) Be Valuable To Income Investors?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosCould Haynes Publishing Group P.L.C. (LON:HYNS) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.A slim 1.7% yield is hard to get excited about, but the long payment history is respectable. At the right price, or with strong growth opportunities, Haynes Publishing Group could have potential. That said, the recent jump in the share price will make Haynes Publishing Group's dividend yield look smaller, even though the company prospects could be improving. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis LSE:HYNS Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Haynes Publishing Group paid out 80% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Paying out a majority of its earnings limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate a commitment to paying a dividend, or a dearth of investment opportunities.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Haynes Publishing Group paid out a conservative 33% of its free cash flow as dividends last year. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.With a strong net cash balance, Haynes Publishing Group investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Haynes Publishing Group's latest financial position,

Haynes Publishing Group has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was UK£0.14 in 2010, compared to UK£0.075 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 6.4% a year during that period. Haynes Publishing Group's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 6.4% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.We struggle to make a case for buying Haynes Publishing Group for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past ten years.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, and a poor history of shrinking dividends, it's even more important to see if EPS are growing. Haynes Publishing Group has grown its earnings per share at 4.9% per annum over the past five years. There are exceptions, but limited earnings growth and a high payout ratio can signal that a company is struggling to grow. When a company prefers to pay out cash to its shareholders instead of reinvesting it, this can often say a lot about that company's dividend prospects.Story continuesConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, we think Haynes Publishing Group has an acceptable payout ratio and its dividend is well covered by cashflow. Second, earnings growth has been ordinary, and its history of dividend payments is chequered - having cut its dividend at least once in the past. While we're not hugely bearish on it, overall we think there are potentially better dividend stocks than Haynes Publishing Group out there.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Haynes Publishing Group stock.
