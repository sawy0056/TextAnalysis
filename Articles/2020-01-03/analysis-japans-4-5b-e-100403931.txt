From $1.2 billion in 2018, the market is predicted to grow to $4.5 billion by 2024 at a 22.6% CAGR during the forecast period (2019-2024).Increasing awareness on the health hazards of tobacco smoking, product innovations, and rising popularity of ashless and smokeless vaping are leading to the Japanese e-cigarette market progress. Unlike conventional products, electronic cigarettes do not have tobacco, but a vial or refill containing a nicotine-based liquid. On burning it, vapor, rather than smoke, is produced, which dissolves in the air within seconds.Based on age group, the Japanese e-cigarette market is categorized into 16-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-65, and 65+. Among these, people falling in the 16-24 and 25-34 age groups were the largest users of such devices during the forecast period (2014-2018), owing to the ingenious marketing strategies adopted by manufacturers, for instance on the popular show, Ame-Talk, which spurred the interest of the younger generations in e-cigarettes. During the forecast period, 35-44-year-old people are expected to adopt these devices the most rapidly.Tobacconist, online, vape shops, hypermarket/supermarket, and others are the various classifications, when the market is segmented by distribution channels. Among these, the tobacconist classification dominated the Japanese e-cigarette market during the historical period; however, the online channel is predicted to grow the fastest during the forecast period to dethrone tobacconists as the largest classification by 2022. It is relatively easier to sell such products on online platforms, and the discounts these offer would further compel consumers to purchase from here.
