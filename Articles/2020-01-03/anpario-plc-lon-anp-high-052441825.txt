Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Anpario:0.12 = UK£4.4m ÷ (UK£39m - UK£2.9m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, Anpario has an ROCE of 12%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Anpario.Anpario's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCECurrent liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Anpario has total liabilities of UK£2.9m and total assets of UK£39m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 7.3% of its total assets. In addition to low current liabilities (making a negligible impact on ROCE), Anpario earns a sound return on capital employed.The Bottom Line On Anpario's ROCEThis is good to see, and while better prospects may exist, Anpario seems worth researching further.
