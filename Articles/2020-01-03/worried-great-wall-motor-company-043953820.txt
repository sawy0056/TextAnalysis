By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Great Wall Motor Company Limited (HKG:2333).Over the last twelve months Great Wall Motor has recorded a ROE of 8.0%. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each HK$1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made HK$0.08 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Great Wall Motor How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Great Wall Motor:8.0% = CN¥4.2b ÷ CN¥53b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Mean?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Great Wall Motor Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Great Wall Motor has a lower ROE than the average (10%) in the Auto industry classification.SEHK:2333 Past Revenue and Net Income, January 2nd 2020MoreUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. We prefer it when the ROE of a company is above the industry average, but it's not the be-all and end-all if it is lower. Nonetheless, it might be wise to check if insiders have been selling.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining Great Wall Motor's Debt And Its 8.0% Return On EquityGreat Wall Motor has a debt to equity ratio of just 0.097, which is very low. Although the ROE isn't overly impressive, the debt load is modest, suggesting the business has potential. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.In SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
