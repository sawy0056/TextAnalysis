We expect ADG to grow through a combination of organic initiatives, including new and next-generation product development, as well as acquisitions that add new solutions, relationships and customers to the business.”“We have developed strong relationships with militaries, legislators and manufacturers globally, ideally placing us to identify, tender and win high-value contracts around the world,” said Patrick Callahan, CEO of AirBoss Defense Group. “In a period of record U.S. defense spending budget allocations, combined with high levels of geopolitical instability around the world, we feel we are very well positioned to capitalize on an even broader array of opportunities to grow the new combined business going forward.”Vendor Takeback NoteTo satisfy the conditions on closing, ADG provided AirBoss with a Vendor Takeback Note valued at US$60 million. The Note is secured against the assets and equity of ADG and matures on January 1, 2026. The Note pays interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 700 bps. ADG is required to pay 2.5% of the initial principal amount plus accrued interest on a semi-annual basis. In addition, 75% of excess cash flow generated by ADG after capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes and other similar payments will be paid to AirBoss annually in further repayment of the Note.Amended and Restated Credit FacilitiesIn connection with the closing of the ADG transaction, AirBoss has also amended its senior secured credit facilities to, among other things, add the U.S. and Canadian AirBoss Defense entities as borrowers under the credit facility. This revision will provide ADG with to up to US$15 million in revolving credit facilities, which are intended to provide the newly merged business with the access to capital necessary to achieve its objectives. The syndicate of lenders will continue to consist of Toronto-Dominion Bank, National Bank of Canada, Comerica Bank and J.P. Morgan. Aggregate availability under the credit facilities will be approximately US$120 million, consisting of a US$60 million term loan, a US$60 million revolving credit facility and an accordion feature of up to an additional US$50 million of availability, upon the satisfaction of customary conditions for such features. The maturity date of the facilities is January 2, 2023. As of January 2, 2020, the revolving credit facility was undrawn.“Allowing ADG to access borrowing capacity under AirBoss’ senior secured credit facilities provides the new entity flexibility in the execution of its growth strategy plus an enhanced ability to manage through periods of variability inherent to the defense business,” said Daniel Gagnon, CFO of AirBoss. “By leveraging AirBoss’ solid balance sheet, ADG has access to capital at a more favourable rate than it could secure independently.”Story continuesOther ConsiderationsHoulihan Lokey Capital, Inc. acted as financial advisor to AirBoss, while Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg LLP is served as AirBoss' legal counsel, with Hogan Lovells serving as US regulatory counsel.
