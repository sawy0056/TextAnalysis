He added that bitcoin has “no real utility.”“They’ve been trying to create a utility for it for ten years now. It’s a solution in search of a problem and it still hasn’t found a problem to solve,” said Kapfidze.Bitcoin has earned many monikers in its 11 years of existence - a "scam" (by Bill Harris, founding CEO of PayPal); "rat poison" (by Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger) and "rat poison squared" (by billionaire investor Warren Buffett), among others.Yet, a recent report from Bank of America names bitcoin the single best investment of the last decade. The report said if you invested $1 in bitcoin at the start of 2010, it would now be worth more than $90,000. Last year alone, the value of one bitcoin rose more than 85%, making it one of the top-performing financial assets in the world.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMortgage rates fall to three-year low amid coronavirus fears — here’s why they may not hit an all-time lowMarketWatchHousing to Get a Jolt With Virus Pushing Down Mortgage RatesBloombergPending home sales rebounded 5.2% in January as low mortgage rates boost the housing sectorMarketWatchU.S. consumer spending could see one-two punch from stocks drop, coronavirusReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
