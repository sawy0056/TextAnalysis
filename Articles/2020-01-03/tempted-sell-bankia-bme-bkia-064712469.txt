(BME:BKIA) Because Of Its P/E Ratio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday, we'll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We'll show how you can use Bankia, S.A.'s (BME:BKIA) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Based on the last twelve months, Bankia's P/E ratio is 10.71. That means that at current prices, buyers pay €10.71 for every €1 in trailing yearly profits. View our latest analysis for Bankia How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Bankia:P/E of 10.71 = €1.90 ÷ €0.18 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Bankia Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (10.6) for companies in the banks industry is roughly the same as Bankia's P/E.BME:BKIA Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreThat indicates that the market expects Bankia will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. So if Bankia actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price. I would further inform my view by checking insider buying and selling., among other things.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Bankia saw earnings per share improve by -7.8% last year.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Bankia's Balance SheetBankia has net debt worth a very significant 206% of its market capitalization. This is a relatively high level of debt, so the stock probably deserves a relatively low P/E ratio. Keep that in mind when comparing it to other companies.The Bottom Line On Bankia's P/E RatioBankia's P/E is 10.7 which is below average (17.3) in the ES market. While the recent EPS growth is a positive, the significant amount of debt on the balance sheet may be contributing to pessimistic market expectations.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
