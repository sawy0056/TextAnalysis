Lackluster demand, including in developed economies, remains a primary concern headed into 2020, Reuters said.U.S. crude oil production in October rose to a record of 12.66 million barrels per day (bpd) from a revised 12.48 million bpd in September, the U.S. government said in a monthly report. The pace of growth is expected to slow in 2020.Annual OutlookWe’re not looking for crude oil prices to move sharply in either direction in 2020 although there is a slight upside bias. Although the markets were up over 20% last year, keep in mind the rally followed a steep sell-off from early October to late December 2018.Brent crude oil could straddle the $63.00 level most of the year as OPEC production cuts offset weaker demand. However, this level is likely to change later in the year especially if OPEC and its allies discontinue the production cuts when they expire in March.Crude oil could also face headwinds from subdued global growth momentum and robust U.S. shale output levels in the first quarter (of 2020).This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
