In tonnes, oil output reached 47.629 million last month versus 46.019 million in November.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak expects Russian oil and condensate production of between 555 million tonnes and 565 million tonnes in 2020, or 11.12-11.32 million bpd using a conversion rate of 7.33 barrels per tonne of oil.Novak has said that Russia reduced its oil output excluding gas condensate by 240,000 bpd in late December compared with levels in October 2018, the baseline for the global deal.OPEC and its producer allies have been capping their collective output since 2017 and Novak on Friday said the OPEC+ nations might consider ending their oil output curbs in 2020.In 2019, oil prices notched the biggest annual gain in three years, supported by a thaw in the prolonged U.S.-China trade war and ongoing supply cuts from major oil producers.Russian oil pipeline exports in December stood at 4.286 million barrels per day, up from 4.147 million barrels per day in the previous month.Russian natural gas production was at 67.21 billion cubic metres (bcm) last month, or 2.17 bcm a day, versus 64.04 bcm in November.(Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; editing by Richard Pullin)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next'Apple Of Oil' Hikes Dividend, Cuts Capex After Bakken Leader Guides Cash Flow LowerInvestor's Business DailyMexico's state-run Pemex posts steep 2019 loss in blow to president's revival planReutersContinental (CLR) Q4 Earnings Top Estimates on Oil ProductionZacksWPX Energy (WPX) Q4 Earnings and Revenues Miss EstimatesZacksChesapeake Energy’s ‘very low’ stock price prompts reverse split plansMarketWatchRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
