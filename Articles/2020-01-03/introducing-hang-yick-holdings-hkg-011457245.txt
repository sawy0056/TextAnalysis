See our latest analysis for Hang Yick Holdings To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last year, Hang Yick Holdings actually saw its earnings per share drop 80%.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We doubt the modest 0.2% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. Hang Yick Holdings's revenue actually dropped 15% over last year.
