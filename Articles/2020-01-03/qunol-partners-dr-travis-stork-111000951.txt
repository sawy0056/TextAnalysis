What people may not know is that I have experienced significant joint pain in recent years, and do everything possible to minimize that joint pain every day," explained Dr. Stork."I started eating an anti-inflammatory diet years ago and added turmeric to my diet due to its anti-inflammatory properties. It's a wonderful spice, but the reality is that you need a significant quantity of the spice in order to realize its anti-inflammatory benefits because it is not well absorbed by the body.  Because Qunol's turmeric formula is high in antioxidant-rich curcuminoids and efficiently absorbed into the bloodstream, it helps me get the full anti-inflammatory benefits of turmeric. Although it may look like I feel great every day, the reality is that my joints hurt when I wake up, sit for too long, or exercise too hard. If I am going to take a turmeric supplement in addition to eating a healthy diet, I want it to be efficiently absorbed into my bloodstream and for it to have the highest possible ratio of curcuminoids to ensure I get the full anti-inflammatory benefit."Turmeric can help with joint support* and reduce inflammation due to overexertion†. Turmeric is widely known to have very poor absorption. Unlike many regular1 turmeric supplements, Qunol's soluble formula offers superior absorption, which is crucial to get the full benefits of turmeric. An anti-inflammatory diet may also support gut health to nurture a healthy microbiome ecosystem. "We now know that cutting out processed foods and replacing them with high fiber foods can nourish a healthy gut microbiome, and that lean people have a more diverse microbiome with up to 70% more gut friendly bacteria," explained Dr. Stork.An anti-inflammatory diet consists of foods that can reduce the body's inflammatory responses, such as whole, nutrient-rich foods that contain high amounts of antioxidants. Anti-inflammatory do's include: dark leafy greens, cold water fish, beans, berries, cruciferous vegetables, turmeric and other spices like cinnamon, green tea, and almonds, among other nutrient and antioxidant-rich foods. Anti-inflammatory don'ts include: processed foods and meats, trans fats, sugary drinks, white bread and pasta, excess carbs, and too much alcohol. Dr. Travis Stork's Anti-Inflammatory Go-To Diet Tips. "Keep your diet clean by focusing on real, whole foods and lots of vegetables. I add turmeric spice or turmeric powder like Qunol's Unflavored Turmeric Powder to many of my favorite foods and smoothies," said Dr. Stork. "Try it on your eggs, favorite smoothie or tuna salad, and definitely give this creamy mashed potato recipe a try. You can even add Qunol Instant Drink Mix to water or juice, shake, and enjoy at home or on the go."Story continuesAbout Travis Stork, M.D.  Dr. Travis Stork is a board-certified emergency medicine physician and co-host of the Emmy® award-winning talk show, The Doctors.
