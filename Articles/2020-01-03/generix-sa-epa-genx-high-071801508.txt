To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Generix:0.13 = €7.7m ÷ (€102m - €40m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Generix has an ROCE of 13%.

Generix's ROCE appears to be substantially greater than the 8.7% average in the Software industry.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Generix's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCECurrent liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Generix has total assets of €102m and current liabilities of €40m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 40% of its total assets. Generix has a medium level of current liabilities, which would boost the ROCE.The Bottom Line On Generix's ROCEWhile its ROCE looks good, it's worth remembering that the current liabilities are making the business look better.
