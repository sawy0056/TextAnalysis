Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.With only a two-year payment history, and a 2.8% yield, investors probably think ACCO Brands is not much of a dividend stock. While it may not look like much, if earnings are growing it could become quite interesting. The company also returned around 6.4% of its market capitalisation to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks over the past year. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis NYSE:ACCO Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, ACCO Brands paid out 25% of its profit as dividends. We'd say its dividends are thoroughly covered by earnings.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. ACCO Brands paid out 16% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservative and suggests the dividend is sustainable. It's positive to see that ACCO Brands's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Is ACCO Brands's Balance Sheet Risky?As ACCO Brands has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. ACCO Brands is carrying net debt of 3.21 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the upper limit of our comfort range on a dividend stock that the investor hopes will endure a wide range of economic circumstances.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Net interest cover of 5.27 times its interest expense appears reasonable for ACCO Brands, although we're conscious that even high interest cover doesn't make a company bulletproof.We update our data on ACCO Brands every 24 hours, so you can always get

The dividend has not fluctuated much, but with a relatively short payment history, we can't be sure this is sustainable across a full market cycle. During the past two-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.24 in 2018, compared to US$0.26 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 4.1% per year over this time.Story continuesWe like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. ACCO Brands has grown its earnings per share at 7.4% per annum over the past five years. A low payout ratio and strong historical earnings growth suggests ACCO Brands has been effectively reinvesting in its business. We think this generally bodes well for its dividend prospects.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. It's great to see that ACCO Brands is paying out a low percentage of its earnings and cash flow. Unfortunately, earnings growth has also been mediocre, and we think it has not been paying dividends long enough to demonstrate resilience across economic cycles. Overall we think ACCO Brands is an interesting dividend stock, although it could be better.Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
