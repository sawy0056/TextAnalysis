The cynical view of the industry has largely stemmed from the of lack blueprint around how the objective will be achieved and the policies the government will frame to enable the industry to achieve the 100% EVization objective. A blanker EVization is a mission impossible and the government has realized that ever since it announced its intent. Whether charging infra should come first or the OEMs should start manufacturing EVs is a classic chicken and egg case and many OEMs have already announced that it wouldn't join the EV bandwagon unless the underlying enabling infrastructure is in place.This is of the view that 2W and 3W are best placed to embrace EVization rapidly as compared to passenger vehicle and commercial vehicles. The modularity of battery and charging infrastructure can accelerate the industrialization of e-2W and e-3W in India. Innovation on the product side and innovation on the portable charging side will help achieve mass industrialization of electric two wheeler market in India.
