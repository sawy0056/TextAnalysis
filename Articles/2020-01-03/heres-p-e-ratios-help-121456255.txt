(NASDAQ:ECOL)Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday, we'll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to US Ecology, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ECOL), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is US Ecology's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 25.31. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 4.0%. See our latest analysis for US Ecology How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for US Ecology:P/E of 25.31 = $57.91 ÷ $2.29 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does US Ecology's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that US Ecology has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the commercial services industry average (26.4).NasdaqGS:ECOL Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that US Ecology shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. So if US Ecology actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price. I would further inform my view by checking insider buying and selling., among other things.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.US Ecology's earnings per share fell by 25% in the last twelve months. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 4.3%.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.So What Does US Ecology's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals 18% of US Ecology's market cap. This could bring some additional risk, and reduce the number of investment options for management; worth remembering if you compare its P/E to businesses without debt.The Bottom Line On US Ecology's P/E RatioUS Ecology's P/E is 25.3 which is above average (18.9) in its market. With a bit of debt, but a lack of recent growth, it's safe to say the market is expecting improved profit performance from the company, in the next few years.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. People often underestimate remarkable growth -- so investors can make money when fast growth is not fully appreciated. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.Story continuesBut note: US Ecology may not be the best stock to buy.
