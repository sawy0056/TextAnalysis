But really bad investments should be rare. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of Asanko Gold Inc. (TSE:AKG), who have seen the share price tank a massive 73% over a three year period. That would be a disturbing experience. On the other hand the share price has bounced 8.9% over the last week. Check out our latest analysis for Asanko Gold Asanko Gold didn't have any revenue in the last year, so it's fair to say it doesn't yet have a proven product (or at least not one people are paying for). We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. For example, investors may be hoping that Asanko Gold finds some valuable resources, before it runs out of money.Companies that lack both meaningful revenue and profits are usually considered high risk. You should be aware that there is always a chance that this sort of company will need to issue more shares to raise money to continue pursuing its business plan. While some companies like this go on to deliver on their plan, making good money for shareholders, many end in painful losses and eventual de-listing. It certainly is a dangerous place to invest, as Asanko Gold investors might realise.Asanko Gold had cash in excess of all liabilities of US$11m when it last reported (September 2019). While that's nothing to panic about, there is some possibility the company will raise more capital, especially if profits are not imminent. We'd venture that shareholders are concerned about the need for more capital, because the share price has dropped 35% per year, over 3 years .
