In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for 888 Holdings:0.38 = US$67m ÷ (US$440m - US$266m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, 888 Holdings has an ROCE of 38%.

To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.888 Holdings has total liabilities of US$266m and total assets of US$440m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 60% of its total assets. 888 Holdings's high level of current liabilities boost the ROCE - but its ROCE is still impressive.What We Can Learn From 888 Holdings's ROCESo to us, the company is potentially worth investigating further. 888 Holdings looks strong on this analysis,
