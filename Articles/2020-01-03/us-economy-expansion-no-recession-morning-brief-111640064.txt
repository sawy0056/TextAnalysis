This has not been an unreasonable thought historically, as the two usual late-cycle risks — inflationary overheating and financial imbalances — often did grow over time. But so far both risks look limited.”Fed chair Jerome Powell has stressed in recent public comments that inflation pressures have been “unexpectedly muted” relative to the Fed’s 2% target. And until there is a material pickup in inflation, Powell expects the Fed’s “somewhat accommodative” policy stance will remain in play.When it comes to financial imbalances, data has consistently shown this economic cycle to be one of consumer deleveraging. And with consumer spending accounting for about 70% of GDP, the relative financial health of consumers is tantamount to the health of the economy.Though as Deutsche Bank’s chief international economist Torsten Sløk notes, corporates have also exhibited a similar caution compared to history. This further suggests this economic cycle — though it is up there in years — shows few signs of breaking down.“This expansion has been characterized by an extreme degree of caution among consumers and corporates,” Sløk said in a note published this weekend.“Because of the experience in 2008-2009, households and companies have been hesitant to spend too much money and take too much risk. As a result, ten years into this expansion, discretionary spending for consumers and corporates is still below its historical average.”Consumer and corporate discretionary spending has remained depressed since the crisis, indicating caution and relative financial stability as we enter the new year. (Source: Deutsche Bank)MoreSløk notes that consumer caution is “highly unusual” compared to the economic cycles we’ve grown accustomed to seeing since World War II.“The lack of willingness to spend on consumer durables and corporate capex is also the reason why this expansion has been so weak,” Sløk adds.“And it is also the reason why this expansion could continue for many more years; we are simply less vulnerable to shocks in 2020 because there are few imbalances in the economy.”By Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round. Follow him @MylesUdlandWhat to watch todayEconomyInitial Jobless Claims, week ended December 28 (222,000 expected, 222,000 prior); Continuing Claims, week ended December 21 (1.719 million prior)Bloomberg Consumer Comfort, week ended December 29 (62.3 prior)Markit US Manufacturing PMI, December final (52.5 expected, 52.5 prior)Read more Top NewsChina sets policy pace for 2020 with reserve cut to aid credit [Bloomberg]Trump's tariffs are backfiring on the U.S., Fed finds [Yahoo Finance]Ghosn met Lebanese president after fleeing Japan: sources [Reuters]California’s new data privacy law will change the internet [Yahoo Finance]YAHOO FINANCE HIGHLIGHTSHere's what in the new law taking on the 'scourge' of robocallsCollege Football Championship ticket prices could become most expensive in historyBitcoin is a pyramid scheme, economist saysFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextEverything Rally Gets Ripped Apart by Virus Fear Lashing MarketsBloombergNetanyahu still 'King Bibi' on Israel's marginsAFPRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
