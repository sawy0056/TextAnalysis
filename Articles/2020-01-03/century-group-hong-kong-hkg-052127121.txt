View our latest analysis for New Century Group Hong Kong To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years over which the share price declined, New Century Group Hong Kong's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 20% each year. The share price decline of 5.0% per year isn't as bad as the EPS decline.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, New Century Group Hong Kong's TSR for the last 5 years was -18%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveNew Century Group Hong Kong provided a TSR of 0.8% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 3.8% endured over half a decade. It could well be that the business is stabilizing.
