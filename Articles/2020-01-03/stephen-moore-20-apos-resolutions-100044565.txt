No one in America has a right not to be offended by what someone else says.End once and for all the apocalyptic climate change narrative. If the scientists are really so smart, they should be able to devise solutions that don't shut down America's production of cheap and abundant oil, gas and coal and puts millions of American workers out of jobs.Stop calling people "racists," or "fascists" every time you disagree with them. Explain to replay officials at football games what the term "indisputable evidence" means to overturn a ref's call on the field. It is not "preponderance of the evidence," it must be"indisputable" -- and anyone who watched the Clemson-Ohio State college football playoff injustice knows what I am talking about.Stop using young children as props to advance political causes. Stop making movies that drag on for more than two and a half hours.  Stop mandating paper straws.
