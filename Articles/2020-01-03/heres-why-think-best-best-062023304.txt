But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like Best of the Best (LON:BOTB). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. Check out our latest analysis for Best of the Best How Fast Is Best of the Best Growing?As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Who among us would not applaud Best of the Best's stratospheric annual EPS growth of 58%, compound, over the last three years? Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but like a lotus blooming from a murky pond, it sparks joy for the wary stock pickers.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). Best of the Best maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 14% to UK£15m. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

That makes it extra important to check on its balance sheet strength.Are Best of the Best Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Personally, I like to see high insider ownership of a company, since it suggests that it will be managed in the interests of shareholders. So as you can imagine, the fact that Best of the Best insiders own a significant number of shares certainly appeals to me. In fact, they own 74% of the company, so they will share in the same delights and challenges experienced by the ordinary shareholders. This makes me think they will be incentivised to plan for the long term - something I like to see. With that sort of holding, insiders have about UK£25m riding on the stock, at current prices. That should be more than enough to keep them focussed on creating shareholder value!Does Best of the Best Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Best of the Best's earnings per share growth have been levitating higher, like a mountain goat scaling the Alps. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders certainly brightens my view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point; and I do like those. So yes, on this short analysis I do think it's worth considering Best of the Best for a spot on your watchlist. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Best of the Best by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.Story continuesOf course, you can do well (sometimes) buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.
