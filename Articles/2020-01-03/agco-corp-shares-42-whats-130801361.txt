The company gained from its price-realization initiatives, improved productivity and focus on margin expansion amid sluggish farming conditions in major markets during the quarter.Upbeat Outlook:  AGCO anticipates improved gross and operating margins, backed by positive impact of pricing and benefits from cost-reduction initiatives. These positives are likely to offset the adverse impact of foreign-currency translation and relatively flat sale volumes. Furthermore, the company is likely to witness growth in its grain and protein business, driven by expectations of an increase in population and higher protein consumption.Positive Growth Projections: For 2020, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $5.29, indicating year-over-year growth of 4.5%. Growth DriversAGCO is consistently making strategic investments to enhance and expand its product lines, upgrade system capabilities and improve factory productivity.
