Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Mirvac Group (ASX:MGR) shareholders have enjoyed a 73% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 23% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 50% , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for Mirvac Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Mirvac Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 11.53.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:MGR Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Mirvac Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Mirvac Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 119%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Mirvac Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 50% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 17%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
