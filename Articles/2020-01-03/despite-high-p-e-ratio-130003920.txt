The image below shows that Fiserv has a higher P/E than the average (30.9) P/E for companies in the it industry.NasdaqGS:FISV Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreFiserv's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Fiserv's earnings per share fell by 40% in the last twelve months. But EPS is up 6.1% over the last 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Is Debt Impacting Fiserv's P/E?Fiserv has net debt equal to 27% of its market cap.
