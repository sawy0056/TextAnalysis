For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?So, the natural question for Ceres Power Holdings (LON:CWR) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. Check out our latest analysis for Ceres Power Holdings Does Ceres Power Holdings Have A Long Cash Runway?You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. When Ceres Power Holdings last reported its balance sheet in June 2019, it had zero debt and cash worth UK£71m. In the last year, its cash burn was UK£12m. Therefore, from June 2019 it had 5.9 years of cash runway. Importantly, though, analysts think that Ceres Power Holdings will reach cashflow breakeven before then. In that case, it may never reach the end of its cash runway. The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.AIM:CWR Historical Debt, January 2nd 2020MoreHow Well Is Ceres Power Holdings Growing?At first glance it's a bit worrying to see that Ceres Power Holdings actually boosted its cash burn by 9.6%, year on year. Given that its operating revenue increased 142% in that time, it seems the company has reason to think its expenditure is working well to drive growth. If that revenue does keep flowing reliably, then the company could see a strong improvement in free cash flow simply by reducing growth expenditure. It seems to be growing nicely. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at our analyst forecasts for the company.How Easily Can Ceres Power Holdings Raise Cash?While Ceres Power Holdings seems to be in a decent position, we reckon it is still worth thinking about how easily it could raise more cash, if that proved desirable. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.Ceres Power Holdings's cash burn of UK£12m is about 3.0% of its UK£403m market capitalisation. That means it could easily issue a few shares to fund more growth, and might well be in a position to borrow cheaply.So, Should We Worry About Ceres Power Holdings's Cash Burn?It may already be apparent to you that we're relatively comfortable with the way Ceres Power Holdings is burning through its cash. For example, we think its revenue growth suggests that the company is on a good path. Although its increasing cash burn does give us reason for pause, the other metrics we discussed in this article form a positive picture overall. Shareholders can take heart from the fact that analysts are forecasting it will reach breakeven. Looking at all the measures in this article, together, we're not worried about its rate of cash burn; the company seems well on top of its medium-term spending needs. For us, it's always important to consider risks around cash burn rates. But investors should look at a whole range of factors when researching a new stock. For example, it could be interesting to see how much the Ceres Power Holdings CEO receives in total remuneration.Story continuesOf course Ceres Power Holdings may not be the best stock to buy.
