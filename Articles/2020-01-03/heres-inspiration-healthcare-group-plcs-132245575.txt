If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Inspiration Healthcare Group shrunk earnings per share by 10% over the last year. But over the longer term (3 years), earnings per share have increased by 7.0%.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Inspiration Healthcare Group's Balance SheetWith net cash of UK£2.7m, Inspiration Healthcare Group has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 10% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On Inspiration Healthcare Group's P/E RatioInspiration Healthcare Group's P/E is 19.1 which is about average (18.3) in the GB market. While the lack of recent growth is probably muting optimism, the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth.
