Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ENXTBR:COMB Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. While Compagnie du Bois Sauvage pays a dividend, it reported a loss over the last year. When a financial business is loss-making and pays a dividend, the dividend is not covered by profits. Its important that investors assess the quality of the company's assets and whether it can return to generating a positive income.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Compagnie du Bois Sauvage's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Compagnie du Bois Sauvage's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €6.60 in 2010, compared to €7.70 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 1.6% per year over this time.Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think is seriously impressive.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. In the last five years, Compagnie du Bois Sauvage's earnings per share have shrunk at approximately 7.2% per annum. A modest decline in earnings per share is not great to see, but it doesn't automatically make a dividend unsustainable. Still, we'd vastly prefer to see EPS growth when researching dividend stocks.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Compagnie du Bois Sauvage is paying out a dividend despite reporting a loss; clearly a concern. Moreover, earnings have been shrinking. While the dividends have been fairly steady, we'd wonder for how much longer this will be sustainable if earnings continue to decline. To conclude, we've spotted a couple of potential concerns with Compagnie du Bois Sauvage that may make it less than ideal candidate for dividend investors.Story continuesAre management backing themselves to deliver performance?
