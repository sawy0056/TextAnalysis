View our latest analysis for AGRANA Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.AGRANA Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 48% per year, over the last three years. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 14% compound annual share price fall. This suggests that the market retains some optimism around long term earnings stability, despite past EPS declines.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for AGRANA Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft the TSR over the last 3 years was -26%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveAGRANA Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft provided a TSR of 18% over the year (including dividends) . That's fairly close to the broader market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 5.2% per year. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down.
