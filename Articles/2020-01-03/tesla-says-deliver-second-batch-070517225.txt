Production started in October with a target of 250,000 vehicles per year once the Model Y is added to the line up."As Model 3s roll off Tesla's Chinese manufacturing facility with local subsidies intact, we believe the U.S.-based focus will need to shift globally for the company," Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to clients.China will be an important market for the company in 2020, said Dorsheimer, who raised his price target on Tesla to $515, the second-highest on Wall Street.The Model 3 is priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,000) before subsidies. Tesla said previously that it wanted to start deliveries before the Chinese new year beginning Jan. 25.Tesla's China general manager, Wang Hao, said the company plans to ramp up Model 3 deliveries in January.Tesla executives also told reporters the plant had achieved a production target of 1,000 units per week, or around 280 cars a day, and that sales for the China-made sedan had so far been "very good".Hao had said the company will double the number of service centers and fast charging stations in China in 2020.Shares of Tesla, which is expected to report its fourth-quarter delivery numbers in the next few days, rose 1.1% to $422.88 in premarket trading.The stock, which touched a record high of $435.31 last week, has had a strong run in recent months on the back of posting a rare profit in the latest quarter and news of China ramp up.(Reporting by Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh, Additional Reporting by Amal S; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Anil D'Silva)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGlobal coronavirus cases rise as China’s downward trend continuesPA Media: World NewsHow Does China Grand Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Holdings Limited (HKG:512) Stand Up To These Simple Dividend Safety Checks?Simply Wall St.Here's How We Evaluate China Gas Holdings Limited's (HKG:384) DividendSimply Wall St.Korea Cases Top 2,000; WHO Sees ‘Decisive’ Stage: Virus UpdateBloombergHow investors are using ‘alternative’ data to track China’s recovery from coronaviruMarketWatchRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
