Check out our latest analysis for New Zealand Refining How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for New Zealand Refining:P/E of 20.26 = NZ$1.88 ÷ NZ$0.09 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each NZ$1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does New Zealand Refining's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company.

And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 33% per year over the last three years. This might lead to low expectations.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.New Zealand Refining's Balance SheetNew Zealand Refining has net debt equal to 45% of its market cap. While it's worth keeping this in mind, it isn't a worry.The Verdict On New Zealand Refining's P/E RatioNew Zealand Refining has a P/E of 20.3.
