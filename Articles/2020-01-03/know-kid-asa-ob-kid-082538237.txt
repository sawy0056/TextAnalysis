Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Kid ASA (OB:KID).What Is Insider Selling?It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. View our latest analysis for Kid Kid Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chief Executive Officer Anders Fjeld for kr910k worth of shares, at about kr45.48 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of kr49.70 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. The good news for Kid share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.Kid insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any.
