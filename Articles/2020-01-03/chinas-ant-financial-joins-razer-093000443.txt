"We look forward to contributing to the development of the digital banking landscape in Singapore."Last June the MAS unveiled plans to grant as many as five virtual bank licences to boost competition and innovation. Requiring capital of S$1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion), two will be full bank licences that will allow the applicant to provide a range of banking services to retail and non-retail customers. The other three will be wholesale licences, requiring capital of S$100 million, allowing applicants to provide services to small and medium enterprises as well as other non-retail customer segments."Singapore is already a well-served market " although there is still scope for technology-led innovators to compete, especially in servicing SMEs," said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific financial-technology lead for consulting firm EY.

The consortium is the second group to submit a licence application, after Grab Holdings and Singapore Telecommunications announced their joint bid on Monday, in which Grab holds 60 per cent equity.If its application is approved, Razer Fintech, the company's financial technology unit, plans to build the world's first global youth bank, Razer Youth Bank, to focus on serving youth and millennials. The company said in a statement that it will own a 60 per cent majority stake while its strategic partners will take up the remaining equity interest."Addressing the unmet financial needs of the large, yet underserved, segment of the population through an innovative digital-first banking platform is a natural extension of our payments business," Lee Li Meng, chief strategy officer of Razer and chief executive of Razer Fintech, said in a statement.Bids for the virtual licences were due by the end of 2019 and the MAS is set to announce the successful applicants by mid-2020.Ant Financial is an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the Post.Additional reporting by Tracy QuSign up now for our 50% early bird offer from SCMP Research: China AI Report.
