By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of AcadeMedia AB (publ) (STO:ACAD).AcadeMedia has a ROE of 9.0%, based on the last twelve months. That means that for every SEK1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated SEK0.09 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for AcadeMedia How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for AcadeMedia:9.0% = kr416m ÷ kr4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does Return On Equity Mean?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. A higher profit will lead to a higher ROE. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does AcadeMedia Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, AcadeMedia has a lower ROE than the average (14%) in the Consumer Services industry.OM:ACAD Past Revenue and Net Income, January 2nd 2020MoreThat certainly isn't ideal. We'd prefer see an ROE above the industry average, but it might not matter if the company is undervalued. Nonetheless, it might be wise to check if insiders have been selling.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining AcadeMedia's Debt And Its 9.0% Return On EquityWhile AcadeMedia does have some debt, with debt to equity of just 0.63, we wouldn't say debt is excessive. Its very respectable ROE, combined with only modest debt, suggests the business is in good shape. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company's ability to take advantage of future opportunities.But It's Just One MetricReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
