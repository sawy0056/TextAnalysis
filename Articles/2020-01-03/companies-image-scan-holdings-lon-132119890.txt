For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed.Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Image Scan Holdings (LON:IGE) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). The first step is to compare its cash burn with its cash reserves, to give us its 'cash runway'. Check out our latest analysis for Image Scan Holdings When Might Image Scan Holdings Run Out Of Money?A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. When Image Scan Holdings last reported its balance sheet in September 2019, it had zero debt and cash worth UK£640k. Importantly, its cash burn was UK£142k over the trailing twelve months. So it had a cash runway of about 4.5 years from September 2019. A runway of this length affords the company the time and space it needs to develop the business. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.AIM:IGE Historical Debt, January 2nd 2020MoreHow Well Is Image Scan Holdings Growing?Happily, Image Scan Holdings is travelling in the right direction when it comes to its cash burn, which is down 71% over the last year. Unfortunately, however, operating revenue dropped 32% during the same time frame. Considering the factors above, the company doesn’t fare badly when it comes to assessing how it is changing over time. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years.Can Image Scan Holdings Raise More Cash Easily?While Image Scan Holdings seems to be in a decent position, we reckon it is still worth thinking about how easily it could raise more cash, if that proved desirable. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.Image Scan Holdings's cash burn of UK£142k is about 4.3% of its UK£3.3m market capitalisation. Given that is a rather small percentage, it would probably be really easy for the company to fund another year's growth by issuing some new shares to investors, or even by taking out a loan.So, Should We Worry About Image Scan Holdings's Cash Burn?As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Image Scan Holdings's cash burn. In particular, we think its cash runway stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending. While its falling revenue wasn't great, the other factors mentioned in this article more than make up for weakness on that measure. Looking at all the measures in this article, together, we're not worried about its rate of cash burn, which seems to be under control. We think it's very important to consider the cash burn for loss making companies, but other considerations such as the amount the CEO is paid can also enhance your understanding of the business.
