Winning a license would pit Ant against traditional incumbents such as DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in the growing market for digital banking in Southeast Asia. Ant, which is part-owned by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., can both benefit from the Chinese e-commerce giant’s presence as well as support Alibaba’s regional unit, Lazada.Ant’s move could “pay off in the longer term,” said Vey-Sern Ling, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “Digital banking technologies rolled out in Singapore, and data collected will also support the southeast Asian growth of Alibaba’s e-commerce site Lazada.”Read more: Razer Joins Singapore Digital Bank Race, Targets Millennials (2)There are two licenses on offer for full digital banks, which can serve all kinds of customers and require S$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in capital as well as local control. Another three would be for wholesale banks -- the category that Ant is applying for -- where foreign firms can hold majority stakes and the capital commitment is S$100 million.Two other groups have said they submitted bids by Tuesday’s deadline. Gaming company Razer Inc. has teamed up with Asian billionaires and ride-hailing giant Grab Holdings Inc. joined forces with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. Both those groups are seeking full licenses.Southeast Asia’s digital lending market is expected to more than quadruple to $110 billion by 2025, according to a report by Bain & Co., Google and Temasek Holdings Pte.Singapore’s efforts to open up the banking industry to technology companies come on the heels of a similar move in Hong Kong, where Ant and Chinese competitors including Tencent Holdings Ltd. obtained licenses earlier this year.Ant’s payments app Alipay and its local e-wallet partners had about 900 million annual active users in China and 1.2 billion globally as of June, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Other moves to expand outside the mainland include a project to use blockchain technology to enable cross-border remittances between Hong Kong and the Philippines. The company has invested in at least eight digital wallet operators outside China, including Paytm in India and Dana in Indonesia.(Updates with analyst’s comment from the third paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Marcus WrightFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLimited Virus Testing in Japan Masks True Scale of InfectionBloombergOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergChina Stock Option’s 2,800% Surge Shows Rush for HedgesBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2014 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergDell Projects Profit That Falls Short of Estimates on PC WarningBloombergRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
