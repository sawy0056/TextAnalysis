But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in IDP Education (ASX:IEL). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. See our latest analysis for IDP Education IDP Education's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, IDP Education has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years. This has no doubt fuelled the optimism that sees the stock trading on a high multiple of earnings.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). IDP Education maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 23% to AU$598m. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of IDP Education's forecast profits?Are IDP Education Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I always like to check up on CEO compensation, because I think that reasonable pay levels, around or below the median, can be a sign that shareholder interests are well considered. For companies with market capitalizations between AU$2.8b and AU$9.1b, like IDP Education, the median CEO pay is around AU$3.3m.The IDP Education CEO received AU$2.3m in compensation for the year ending June 2019. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Should You Add IDP Education To Your Watchlist?For growth investors like me, IDP Education's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With swiftly growing earnings, it probably has its best days ahead, and the modest CEO pay suggests the company is careful with cash. So I'd argue this is the kind of stock worth watching, even if it isn't great value today. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth.
