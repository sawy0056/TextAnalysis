But that can't change the reality that over the longer term (five years), the returns have been really quite dismal. Indeed, the share price is down 65% in the period. So we're not so sure if the recent bounce should be celebrated. We'd err towards caution given the long term under-performance. View our latest analysis for HKC International Holdings Given that HKC International Holdings didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.Over five years, HKC International Holdings grew its revenue at 3.3% per year. That's far from impressive given all the money it is losing. This lacklustre growth has no doubt fueled the loss of 19% per year, in that time. We want to see an acceleration of revenue growth (or profits) before showing much interest in this one.
