New Year's Resolutions simplified with Free Delivery on Lifestyle Bowls in JanuaryNEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Jan. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) announced today that it's rolling out a Supergreens salad mix nationally this week. Made of hand-cut romaine, antioxidant-rich baby kale and crisp baby spinach, Supergreens will replace the existing romaine-only salad base. This is Chipotle's second new menu item added in the last four months, following the successful launch of Carne Asada in September 2019. Chipotle has also made its grilled, Adobo chicken Whole30® compliant by switching the oil in its marinade, keeping the same great taste, but providing guests with specific dietary goals more options. View photosChipotle's New Supergreens Lifestyle BowlsMoreChipotle was the first in the fast-casual industry to offer preconfigured, diet driven Lifestyle Bowls last year, which aided its digital sales growth to hit a $1B milestone recently.
