These new beverages take the most liked attributes of products in different categories to create new drinking experiences - fruit juice-infused sparkling waters, coffee sodas, nitro cold brew coffee, plant-based clean energy drinks, kombucha.Convenience has also driven growth in the market, with product forms that cater to evolving consumer behavior and consumption patterns performing best. Single-serve coffee pods have been a godsend for people who don't want or don't have time to make a pot of coffee. And single-serve RTD beverages cater to the growing number of consumers who drink and snack on-the-go throughout a day. Many of these consumers aren't sitting down for a lot of meals at home, particularly breakfast, which has hurt sales of traditional jugs and cartons of orange juice and milk.These are just a few of the trends and opportunities examined in the publisher's U.S. Beverage Market Outlook, 2019.
