But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like Far East Hospitality Trust (SGX:Q5T). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Far East Hospitality Trust How Fast Is Far East Hospitality Trust Growing Its Earnings Per Share?In a capitalist society capital chases profits, and that means share prices tend rise with earnings per share (EPS). So like the hint of a smile on a face that I love, growing EPS generally makes me look twice. It is therefore awe-striking that Far East Hospitality Trust's EPS went from S$0.013 to S$0.042 in just one year. Even though that growth rate is unlikely to be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. It seems Far East Hospitality Trust is pretty stable, since revenue and EBIT margins are pretty flat year on year. That's not bad, but it doesn't point to ongoing future growth, either.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Far East Hospitality Trust with market caps between S$538m and S$2.2b is about S$900k.Far East Hospitality Trust offered total compensation worth S$614k to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Should You Add Far East Hospitality Trust To Your Watchlist?Far East Hospitality Trust's earnings have taken off like any random crypto-currency did, back in 2017. Such fast EPS growth makes me wonder if the business has hit an inflection point (and I mean the good kind.) At the same time the reasonable CEO compensation reflects well on the board of directors. While I couldn't be sure without a deeper dive, it does seem that Far East Hospitality Trust has the hallmarks of a quality business; and that would make it well worth watching.
