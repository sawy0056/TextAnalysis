That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation.

Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.KABE Group AB (publ.) maintained roughly steady earnings over the last twelve months. But it has grown its earnings per share by 17% per year over the last five years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company.
