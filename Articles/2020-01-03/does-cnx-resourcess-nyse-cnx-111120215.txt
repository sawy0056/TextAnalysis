But shareholders may not all be feeling jubilant, since the share price is still down 24% in the last year.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. Check out our latest analysis for CNX Resources Does CNX Resources Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?CNX Resources's P/E of 5.79 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. The image below shows that CNX Resources has a lower P/E than the average (11.0) P/E for companies in the oil and gas industry.NYSE:CNX Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreCNX Resources's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.CNX Resources shrunk earnings per share by 66% over the last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 7.7%.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does CNX Resources's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals a substantial 160% of CNX Resources's market cap. This level of debt justifies a relatively low P/E, so remain cognizant of the debt, if you're comparing it to other stocks.The Bottom Line On CNX Resources's P/E RatioCNX Resources has a P/E of 5.8. That's below the average in the US market, which is 18.9. When you consider that the company has significant debt, and didn't grow EPS last year, it isn't surprising that the market has muted expectations. What is very clear is that the market has become less pessimistic about CNX Resources over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 4.3 back then to 5.8 today. For those who like to invest in turnarounds, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But others might consider the opportunity to have passed.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
