In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Kam Hing International Holdings:0.042 = HK$112m ÷ (HK$4.6b - HK$2.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Kam Hing International Holdings has an ROCE of 4.2%.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. You can check if Kam Hing International Holdings has cyclical profits by looking at this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.What Are Current Liabilities, And How Do They Affect Kam Hing International Holdings's ROCE?Short term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Kam Hing International Holdings has total liabilities of HK$2.0b and total assets of HK$4.6b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 43% of its total assets. With a medium level of current liabilities boosting the ROCE a little, Kam Hing International Holdings's low ROCE is unappealing.Story continuesOur Take On Kam Hing International Holdings's ROCEThis company may not be the most attractive investment prospect.
