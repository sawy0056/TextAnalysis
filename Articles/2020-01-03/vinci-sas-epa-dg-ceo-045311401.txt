Huillard became the CEO of VINCI SA (EPA:DG) in 2006. This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at other big companies. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels. Check out our latest analysis for VINCI How Does Xavier M. Huillard's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?Our data indicates that VINCI SA is worth €55b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as €4.6m for the year to December 2018. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at €1.1m. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. When we examined a group of companies with market caps over €7.2b, we found that their median CEO total compensation was €3.2m. (We took a wide range because the CEOs of massive companies tend to be paid similar amounts - even though some are quite a bit bigger than others).It would therefore appear that VINCI SA pays Xavier M. Huillard more than the median CEO remuneration at large companies, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. We can get a better idea of how generous the pay is by looking at the performance of the underlying business.The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at VINCI has changed from year to year.ENXTPA:DG CEO Compensation, January 2nd 2020MoreIs VINCI SA Growing?Over the last three years VINCI SA has grown its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 10% per year (using a line of best fit).
