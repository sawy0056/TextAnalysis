But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last year have been pleasing. To wit, it had solidly beat the market, up 67%. Check out our latest analysis for ams To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last twelve months, ams actually shrank its EPS by 15%.So we don't think that investors are paying too much attention to EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We think that the revenue growth of 18% could have some investors interested. We do see some companies suppress earnings in order to accelerate revenue growth.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).SWX:AMS Income Statement, January 2nd 2020MoreYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?Investors should note that there's a difference between ams's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. ams's TSR of 67% for the year exceeded its share price return, because it has paid dividends.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that ams shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 67% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 2.3%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. Is ams cheap compared to other companies?
