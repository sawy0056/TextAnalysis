(NYSE:AXTA) Looks Like A Quality CompanySimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 2, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosWhile some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. (NYSE:AXTA), by way of a worked example.Over the last twelve months Axalta Coating Systems has recorded a ROE of 21%. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated $0.21 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Axalta Coating Systems How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Axalta Coating Systems:21% = US$287m ÷ US$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Mean?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the yearly profit. A higher profit will lead to a higher ROE. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Axalta Coating Systems Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Axalta Coating Systems has a higher ROE than the average (13%) in the Chemicals industry.NYSE:AXTA Past Revenue and Net Income, January 2nd 2020MoreThat's what I like to see. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining Axalta Coating Systems's Debt And Its 21% Return On EquityAxalta Coating Systems does use a significant amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.83. Its ROE is quite good but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
