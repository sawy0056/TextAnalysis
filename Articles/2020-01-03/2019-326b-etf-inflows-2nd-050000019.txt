When all was said and done, 2019 inflows for U.S.-listed ETFs totaled $326.3 billion, more than 2018’s $315.4 billion and second only to 2017’s $476.1 billion haul.
In a surprising twist, U.S. fixed income ETFs managed to attract more inflows than U.S. equity ETFs, $135.4 billion, compared to $130.2 billion (more on that below).
Choppy Ride, Fantastic Returns It certainly wasn’t a smooth ride to get to $326.3 billion. Through the first five months of the year, ETFs had only gathered $68.1 billion as trade war, global economy and yield curve concerns made investors skittish. But as the year went on and stocks seesawed higher, investors’ confidence—and the money flowing into ETFs—grew in tandem.It didn’t hurt that along with stocks, bond markets also experienced a fantastic rally in 2019. The S&P 500’s 31.5% return was its best showing in six years, while the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was up 8.7%, its best performance in 17 years.Even commodities, as measured by the S&P GSCI Total Return Index, rallied a respectable 17.6%, led by gains in oil, gold and palladium.There is no question that 2019 was a great year for financial markets, and the year’s ETF inflows reflect that.Fixed Income Outpaces Equities Perhaps the most surprising aspect of 2019’s ETF flows was the fact that U.S. fixed income ETFs managed to attract more new money than U.S. equity ETFs. On net, $135.4 billion flowed into U.S. fixed income ETFs, while $130.2 billion went into U.S. equity ETFs.The gap was even wider earlier in the year—more than $30 billion—when bonds surged, the yield curve inverted and concerns about a potential recession were greatest. Those concerns have since melted away, but the flows into fixed income ETFs remained strong throughout the year.Four U.S. fixed income ETFs and one international fixed income ETF claimed spots on the top 10 inflows list: the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), the iShares MBS ETF (MBB), the iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF (GOVT) and the Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX).The $12B Club U.S. equities may not have captured the majority of 2019’s ETF inflows, but they had a respectable year by any measure. In fact, there were three products that pulled in more than $12 billion each: the Vanguard Total Stock Mark ETF (VTI), the iShares Edge Min Vol U.S.A. ETF (USMV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO).The iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA), with inflows of $11.4 billion, was the only international equity ETF to crack the top 10.Largest Outflows Meanwhile, the ETFs with the largest outflows of 2019 were a combination of international, short-term bond and sector funds. The iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA)—the more-expensive cousin of the aforementioned IEFA—topped the outflows list with redemptions of $8.2 billion.The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the world’s largest ETF, also made the list, with net outflows of $2.1 billion for the year. However, price appreciation more than made up for those modest outflows and SPY’s assets under management topped $300 billion for the first time ever, up from $240 billion at the start of the year.Total assets under management for all U.S.-listed ETFs now stand at $4.4 trillion, up $1.1 trillion year-over-year. Top Gainers (Year-to-Date)
