But if you look at the last five years the returns have not been good. After all, the share price is down 45% in that time, significantly under-performing the market. Check out our latest analysis for Credit Suisse Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Credit Suisse Group moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.Arguably, the revenue drop of 5.1% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. That could explain the weak share price.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).SWX:CSGN Income Statement, January 2nd 2020MoreCredit Suisse Group is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Credit Suisse Group the TSR over the last 5 years was -31%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveCredit Suisse Group shareholders are up 24% for the year (even including dividends) . But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 7.2% endured over half a decade. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around.
