But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 119% in five years. Check out our latest analysis for Xylem In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Xylem managed to grow its earnings per share at 11% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 17% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NYSE:XYL Past and Future Earnings, January 2nd 2020MoreWe know that Xylem has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Xylem will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Xylem the TSR over the last 5 years was 134%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveXylem shareholders are up 24% for the year (even including dividends) . But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 19% over half a decade It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals.
