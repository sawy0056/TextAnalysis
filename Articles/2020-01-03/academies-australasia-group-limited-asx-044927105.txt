How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.With Academies Australasia Group yielding 8.8% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. The company also returned around 2.1% of its market capitalisation to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks over the past year. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Academies Australasia Group for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Academies Australasia Group! ASX:AKG Historical Dividend Yield, January 2nd 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Academies Australasia Group paid out 100% of its profit as dividends. Its payout ratio is quite high, and the dividend is not well covered by earnings. If earnings are growing or the company has a large cash balance, this might be sustainable - still, we think it is a concern.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Academies Australasia Group paid out a conservative 38% of its free cash flow as dividends last year. While the dividend was not well covered by profits, at least they were covered by free cash flow. Still, if the company continues paying out such a high percentage of its profits, the dividend could be at risk if business turns sour.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Academies Australasia Group's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Academies Australasia Group's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Academies Australasia Group has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was AU$0.02 in 2010, compared to AU$0.047 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 9.0% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.Story continuesA reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. Academies Australasia Group's EPS have fallen by approximately 14% per year during the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective, as even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Academies Australasia Group's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. We're not keen on the fact that Academies Australasia Group paid out such a high percentage of its income, although its cashflow is in better shape. Earnings per share are down, and Academies Australasia Group's dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. Overall, Academies Australasia Group falls short in several key areas here. Unless the investor has strong grounds for an alternative conclusion, we find it hard to get interested in a dividend stock with these characteristics.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Academies Australasia Group stock.
