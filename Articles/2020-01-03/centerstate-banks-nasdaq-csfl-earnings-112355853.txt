But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like CenterState Bank (NASDAQ:CSFL). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for CenterState Bank How Fast Is CenterState Bank Growing?As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that CenterState Bank has managed to grow EPS by 33% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of CenterState Bank's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note CenterState Bank's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 55% to US$684m. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for CenterState Bank?Are CenterState Bank Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I like company leaders to have some skin in the game, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own CenterState Bank shares worth a considerable sum. Given insiders own a small fortune of shares, currently valued at US$67m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to make me think that management will be very focussed on long term growth.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. Well, based on the CEO pay, I'd say they are indeed. For companies with market capitalizations between US$2.0b and US$6.4b, like CenterState Bank, the median CEO pay is around US$5.1m.The CEO of CenterState Bank only received US$2.4m in total compensation for the year ending December 2018. That looks like modest pay to me, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Story continuesDoes CenterState Bank Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Given my belief that share price follows earnings per share you can easily imagine how I feel about CenterState Bank's strong EPS growth. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. Each to their own, but I think all this makes CenterState Bank look rather interesting indeed. Of course, just because CenterState Bank is growing does not mean it is undervalued.
