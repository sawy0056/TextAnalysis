The update in policy, which the Journal said could come as soon as Friday, is intended to curb a surge in underage vaping and will be applied to pod-based vaporizers, including those made by Juul, NJOY Holdings Inc. and Reynolds American Inc.The ban will include mint, but allows menthol- and tobacco-flavored e-cigarette pods to remain on store shelves, the Journal reported. The FDA will reportedly continue to allow "open-tank" vaping devices with which users mix their own nicotine flavors, the newspaper said. Tobacco company Altria Group Inc (NYSE: MO) invested $12.8 billion in Juul in 2018, taking a 35% stake in the e-cigarette maker. The tobacco company later announced a .5-billion impairment charge on the investment. Price ActionAltria shares were trading up 0.42% at $50.12 just before the open Thursday.The stock has a 52-week high of $57.88 and a 52-week low of $39.30.Related Links:FDA Warns Juul On Marketing To YouthTobacco Stocks React As FDA Investigates Reports Of Seizures After Vaping0See more from BenzingaThe Best And Worst IPOs Of 2019Urovant Sciences Trades Higher After Submitting Application For Overactive Bladder TreatmentSeadrill Scores 3-Year, 9M Middle East Contract© 2020 Benzinga.com.
