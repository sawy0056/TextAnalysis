But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR), which is up 64%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 39% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 48% , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for Entergy There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last three years, Entergy failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 17% (annualized).This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Given this situation, it makes sense to look at other metrics too.We severely doubt anyone is particularly impressed with the modest 0.4% three-year revenue growth rate. So truth be told we can't see an easy explanation for the share price action, but perhaps you can...You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NYSE:ETR Income Statement, January 2nd 2020MoreWe know that Entergy has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store? You can see what analysts are predicting for Entergy in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Entergy the TSR over the last 3 years was 86%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Entergy shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 48% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 11% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
