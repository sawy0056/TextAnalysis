Looking back, however, it's hard to recall anything making more of a splash in human and pet supplements than CBD (cannabidiol), whose explosion on to the market has brought new attention to the supplements business as a whole, with a halo effect that seems likely to last for years. Both driving and reacting to consumer demand for CBD, interest in the medical and medication-manufacturing community is at an all-time high, with studies showing CBD to be useful in treating myriad health conditions including anxiety and pain.This report provides a thorough analysis of how these trends are playing out as marketers seek new ways to make supplements an integral part of pet wellness. The market is expected to show moderate but steady growth for the foreseeable future, bolstered by the continued raising of the bar on pet wellness in the broader pet products industry.Despite the favorable outlook, pet supplement marketers will continue to face competition from marketers of functional, condition-specific treats and foods, which can siphon sales away from pet supplements as pet owners seek out ways to address their pets' nutritional and wellness needs in-convenient and pet-pampering formats. CBD pharmaceuticals for pets are also likely to emerge as competitors. Pet supplement marketers must also remain up-to-date by capitalizing on-trend ingredients such as CBD while still assuring consumers of product safety and efficacy.Key Topics Covered 1.
