After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put American Woodmark Corporation AMWD stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, American Woodmark has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.44, as you can see in the chart below:View photos This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.15. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level American Woodmark puts current PE ratio below its midpoint (which is 20.30) over the past five years.View photos Also, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 24.27. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.View photosStory continues We should also point out that American Woodmark has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 13.94, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, American Woodmark has a P/S ratio of about 1.08. This is somewhat lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.48 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.View photos If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, American Woodmark currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AMWD a solid choice for value investors and some of its other metrics make it clear too.Its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.13, which is noticeably better than the industry average of 11.08. Clearly, AMWD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though American Woodmark might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B. This gives AMWD a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>).Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher, while current year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revision in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0.7% in the past two months, while the current year estimate has improved 2.04% in the same time period. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:American Woodmark Corporation Price and ConsensusView photosAmerican Woodmark Corporation Price and ConsensusMoreAmerican Woodmark Corporation price-consensus-chart | American Woodmark Corporation QuoteDespite this somewhat mixed trend, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above-average performance from the company in the near-term.Bottom LineAmerican Woodmark is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Boasting a good industry rank (Top 19% out of more than 250 industries) and a top Zacks Rank, the company deserves attention right now.  In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:View photos So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.
