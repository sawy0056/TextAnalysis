We'll show how you can use Itera ASA's (OB:ITE) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Itera has a price to earnings ratio of 22.87, based on the last twelve months. That means that at current prices, buyers pay NOK22.87 for every NOK1 in trailing yearly profits. Check out our latest analysis for Itera How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Itera:P/E of 22.87 = NOK11.50 ÷ NOK0.50 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each NOK1 the company has earned over the last year. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Itera Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (22.7) for companies in the it industry is roughly the same as Itera's P/E.OB:ITE Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that Itera shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. So if Itera actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Itera increased earnings per share by a whopping 41% last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 32% per year over the last five years. With that performance, I would expect it to have an above average P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Is Debt Impacting Itera's P/E?Since Itera holds net cash of kr46m, it can spend on growth, justifying a higher P/E ratio than otherwise.The Bottom Line On Itera's P/E RatioItera trades on a P/E ratio of 22.9, which is above its market average of 14.4. The excess cash it carries is the gravy on top its fast EPS growth. To us, this is the sort of company that we would expect to carry an above average price tag (relative to earnings).When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is better than it expects, you can make money by buying and holding for the long term.
