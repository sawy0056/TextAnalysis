The figure was ahead of analysts’ expectations with the median forecast at 45.9.Chris Williamson of Markit, the company that produces the data, commented that despite the recent optimism, there is still a long way to go for a return of growth. He added that new order inflows continue to fall at the largest pace in over seven years.Manufacturing PMI data released today showed most major Eurozone economies beating analyst expectations although all but France remain in a contraction in this sector.EUR/USD was little moved on the data releases but fell rather sharply a minute before the European open.The pair has shown strong upward momentum as of late and has gained roughly one and a quarter percent since the low last week. The exchange rate has benefited from a broadly weaker greenback as the trade-weighted dollar index (DXY) has declined to a fresh six-month low.Technical AnalysisEarly day price action signals the potential of more downside for EUR/USD although the recent upward momentum cannot be ignored.A horizontal level at 1.1217 is an important one for the exchange rate. This level held the pair higher in November of 2018 and then lower in August last year. The upward momentum seems to be slowing in around the level over the past two sessions.EURUSD 4-Hour ChartMoreThe 1.1173 price point marks a major breakout point for EUR/USD.
