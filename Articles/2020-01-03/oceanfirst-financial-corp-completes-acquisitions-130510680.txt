These forward-looking statements may include: management plans relating to either the acquisition of Two River Bancorp (the “Two River Transaction”) or the acquisition of Country Bank Holding Company, Inc. (the “CYHC Transaction”); any statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations, products or services, including the execution of integration plans relating to either the Two River Transaction or CYHC Transaction or both such transactions; any statements of expectation or belief; projections related to certain financial metrics; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “seek”, “plan”, “will”, “would”, “target,” “outlook,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project” and other similar words and expressions or negatives of these words. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time and are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. OceanFirst does not assume any duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Because forward-looking statements are by their nature, to different degrees, uncertain and subject to assumptions, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that OceanFirst anticipated in its forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from historical performance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those included under Item 1A “Risk Factors” in OceanFirst’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and those disclosed in OceanFirst’s other periodic reports filed with the SEC, as well as the possibility that expected benefits of either the Two River Transaction or CYHC Transaction or both such transactions and the recently completed acquisition of Capital Bank of New Jersey by OceanFirst (the “Recent Acquisition”) may not materialize in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be more costly to achieve; that OceanFirst’s, Two River’s and CYHC’s respective businesses may not perform as expected due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors; that OceanFirst is unable to successfully implement integration strategies related to either the Two River Transaction or CYHC Transaction or both such transactions or the Recent Acquisition; reputational risks and the reaction of the companies’ stockholders, customers, employees and other constituents to the Two River Transaction or CYHC Transaction or both such transactions, and diversion of management time as a result of matters related to either the Two River Transaction or CYHC Transaction or both such transactions. The list of factors presented here, and the list of factors that are presented in the registration statements on Form S-4 for each of the Two River Transaction and CYHC Transaction, is not, and should not be considered, a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. For any forward-looking statements made in this press release or in any documents, OceanFirst claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Story continuesContact:Jill HewittSenior Vice President and Investor Relations OfficerOceanFirst Financial Corp.732.240.4500 ext. 7513jhewitt@oceanfirst.com ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
