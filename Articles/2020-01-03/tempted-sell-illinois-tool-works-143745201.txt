All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Illinois Tool Works's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (22.8) for companies in the machinery industry is roughly the same as Illinois Tool Works's P/E.NYSE:ITW Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 2nd 2020MoreIllinois Tool Works's P/E tells us that market participants think its prospects are roughly in line with its industry. If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Illinois Tool Works increased earnings per share by a whopping 37% last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 11%. I'd therefore be a little surprised if its P/E ratio was not relatively high.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Illinois Tool Works's Balance SheetIllinois Tool Works's net debt is 10% of its market cap. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.The Verdict On Illinois Tool Works's P/E RatioIllinois Tool Works trades on a P/E ratio of 23.6, which is above its market average of 18.9. Its debt levels do not imperil its balance sheet and its EPS growth is very healthy indeed.
