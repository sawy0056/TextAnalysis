But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. To wit, the Ipsos SA (EPA:IPS) share price is 40% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 26% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! In contrast, the longer term returns are negative, since the share price is 6.2% lower than it was three years ago. See our latest analysis for Ipsos In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over the last twelve months, Ipsos actually shrank its EPS by 24%.Given the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Therefore, it seems likely that investors are putting more weight on metrics other than EPS, at the moment.However the year on year revenue growth of 7.7% would help. Many businesses do go through a phase where they have to forgo some profits to drive business development, and sometimes its for the best.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).ENXTPA:IPS Income Statement, January 2nd 2020MoreYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Ipsos, it has a TSR of 46% for the last year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Ipsos has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 46% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 8.8% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Ipsos's dividend track record.
