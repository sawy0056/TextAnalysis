(STRM), provider of integrated solutions, technology-enabled services and analytics supporting revenue cycle optimization for healthcare enterprises today announced that it will release its third quarter 2019 financial performance for the period that ended October 31, 2019, on Wednesday, January 8, 2020 after the close of the financial markets.As previously disclosed, the Company determined that certain corrections were required for capitalized software development costs and related amortization with respect to previously reported periods. Two corrections were required, categorized as follows:(i) software enhancements that were generally released and not amortized in a timely manner, and(ii) amortization expense was calculated using an incorrect method.The first resulted from an administrative error, while the second resulted from a misapplication of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These corrections off-set each other in the Company's previously issued financial statements. Additionally, these differences self-corrected in the Company's financial statements through the periods from Fiscal Year 2016 through Fiscal Q3 2019. The Company evaluated the materiality of the effect of these adjustments and determined it was not necessary to restate its previously issued financial statements.The Company intends to disclose these immaterial corrections through an out of period adjustment in the Company's financial statements for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. The corrections related primarily to Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017 with a cumulative under-amortization of $678,000 that is eliminated through over-amortization in the following periods:(i) $146,000 for Fiscal Year 2018,(ii) $153,000 for Fiscal Q1 2019,(iii) $165,000 for Fiscal Q2 2019,(iv) and $214,000 for Fiscal Q3 2019.The overall impact of reversing these prior-period errors resulted in a $214,000 increase in net income in Fiscal Q3 2019 and a $532,000 increase in net income for the nine months ended October 31, 2019. As of the end of Fiscal Q3 2019, the Company will have no more corrections necessary to accurately reflect the capitalized software development asset, and related accumulated amortization. Further details regarding the corrections will be contained in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2019.The Company will conduct a conference call to review the results on Thursday, January 9, 2020 at 9:00 AM ET.
