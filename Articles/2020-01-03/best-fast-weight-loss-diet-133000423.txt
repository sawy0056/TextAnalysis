This marks the fifth consecutive year that HMR's diet and lifestyle-change program has held the first-place position.View photos Reputation of Rapid Weight LossFast weight loss is often linked to gimmicks, crash diets, and other drastic approaches that are unsustainable and potentially unhealthy. In contrast, HMR achieves fast weight loss through a clinically proven plan that has been available in hospitals since 1983.According to Rick Riess, HMR's Director of Behavioral Program Development, HMR's simple plans are nutritionally complete, calorie-controlled, and designed to help people lose a lot of weight quickly without feeling hungry. He explains, "Simplicity is key. We have people focus on just a few key variables that will have the biggest impact on weight and health. Because it's so easy to follow, people can stick to the diet longer, which can lead to more weight loss in a short amount of time."Weight Loss without Lifestyle Change is Temporary"There's no payoff to losing weight quickly only to have it come back again," says Riess. "That's why lifestyle-change education is at the core of all HMR diet plans. HMR uses the science of behavior change to help people create new habits around healthier eating and increasing daily physical activity in ways that fit into their daily lives over the long term."Published ResultsAt-home: Average weight loss for the Healthy Solutions® at Home program with phone coaching is 23 lbs. at 12 weeks, and 28 lbs. at 26 weeks for those who completed the program.
