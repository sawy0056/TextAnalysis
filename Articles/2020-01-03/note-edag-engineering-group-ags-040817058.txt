We'll use ROE to examine EDAG Engineering Group AG (ETR:ED4), by way of a worked example.EDAG Engineering Group has a ROE of 12%, based on the last twelve months. That means that for every €1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated €0.12 in profit. See our latest analysis for EDAG Engineering Group How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for EDAG Engineering Group:12% = €16m ÷ €130m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does Return On Equity Signify?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does EDAG Engineering Group Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that EDAG Engineering Group has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Auto Components industry average (11%).XTRA:ED4 Past Revenue and Net Income, January 2nd 2020MoreThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. ROE can give us a view about company quality, but many investors also look to other factors, such as whether there are insiders buying shares.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.EDAG Engineering Group's Debt And Its 12% ROEEDAG Engineering Group does use a significant amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.22. There's no doubt the ROE is respectable, but it's worth keeping in mind that metric is elevated by the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.In SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Story continuesBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
