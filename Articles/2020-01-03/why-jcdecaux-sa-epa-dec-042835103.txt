In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for JCDecaux:0.043 = €335m ÷ (€10b - €2.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, JCDecaux has an ROCE of 4.3%. View our latest analysis for JCDecaux Does JCDecaux Have A Good ROCE?One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies. Using our data, JCDecaux's ROCE appears to be significantly below the 8.9% average in the Media industry. This could be seen as a negative, as it suggests some competitors may be employing their capital more efficiently. Aside from the industry comparison, JCDecaux's ROCE is mediocre in absolute terms, considering the risk of investing in stocks versus the safety of a bank account. Investors may wish to consider higher-performing investments.JCDecaux's current ROCE of 4.3% is lower than its ROCE in the past, which was 6.7%, 3 years ago. This makes us wonder if the business is facing new challenges. You can see in the image below how JCDecaux's ROCE compares to its industry.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Since the future is so important for investors, you should check out our free report on analyst forecasts for JCDecaux.JCDecaux's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCECurrent liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.JCDecaux has total assets of €10b and current liabilities of €2.6b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 25% of its total assets. This very reasonable level of current liabilities would not boost the ROCE by much.The Bottom Line On JCDecaux's ROCEIf JCDecaux continues to earn an uninspiring ROCE, there may be better places to invest.
