An HSBC spokesman declined to say how many teller machines (ATMs) had been damaged.Hang Seng Bank, 62 per cent owned by HSBC, said two of its self-service banking centres would be closed in Wan Chai and Causeway Bay until further notice."We strongly condemn the acts of vandalism and damage directed at our premises repeatedly in the last few days. We believe these are unjustified," HSBC said in a statement. "As a bank with deep roots in Hong Kong, we are committed to providing the highest standards of banking services to our customers. We believe the rule of law is essential to Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and we look forward to the speedy resolution of the issues."Hong Kong's bankers brace for smallest bonuses, pay rises in 10 yearsHSBC has joined Bank of China (Hong Kong), Citic Bank and other Chinese-owned lenders in the cross hairs of Hong Kong's radical protesters since Christmas Eve, after a December police crackdown of a crowdfunding platform operated by Spark Alliance that raised money to post bail for arrested demonstrators. The city's police arrested four people on suspicion of money laundering and froze about HK$70 million (US$9 million) in assets held in the corporate account of the non-profit company.HSBC, the largest of Hong Kong's three currency-issuing banks, has attempted to distance itself from the crackdown, saying it closed Spark Alliance's account in adherence to its global compliance standards, "following fund transfer instructions from the customer as the account was not being used for its stated purpose".View photosHSBC staff cleaning up the vandalised lion statue at the HSBC headquarters in Central on January 2.

At least 400 people were arrested as radical protesters blocked roads, threw petrol bombs and vandalised shops and bank branches.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday condemned the "repeated acts of vandalism" against banking facilities in the city, saying individual banks that were affected were assessing the extent of disruptions and will provide updates in due course.Story continues"The expression of opinions should be conducted in a peaceful manner, without affecting the public's access to banking services," the city's de factor central bank said.The regulator did not provide a total number of branches that were closed because of damage, but it appeared to be much fewer than at other times during the protests. In November, 250 bank branches closed for the day " the most in the city's history except during severe typhoons " as a result of three days of violence and traffic disruptions in the city.No money was missing from damaged ATMs in the city, according to several sources close to the HKMA and HSBC.On its website, the Hong Kong Association of Banks only listed a handful of locations of HSBC as being temporarily suspended on Thursday.Shares of HSBC and Hang Seng were mixed on the first trading day of 2020 amid an advancing market.

Bank of China (Hong Kong), HSBC and Standard Chartered are the three note-issuing banks in the city.Mainland banks in the city have fortified their locations in recent months as they have increasingly become targets of vandalism by more radical protesters, with branches adding temporary exterior walls to some branches to prevent damage to windows and ATMs.On Thursday, workers were painting over graffiti and adding new locks at mainland branches along Hennessy Road in Wan Chai. Workers also were seen clearing glass from a smashed front door at the China Life Insurance building on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
