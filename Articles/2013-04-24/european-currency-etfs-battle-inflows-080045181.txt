As European nations begin to regain control of their economies, many investors who avoided the short-term effects of the recession are now left looking for a way to recoup their loses, even with slowly developing market growth. Currency ETFs offer a direct route to the health of a country, with three Guggenheim funds creating an effective picture of the past five years in European markets: CurrencyShares Euro Currency Trust (FXE, B), the British Pound Sterling Trust (FXB, A-) and the Swiss Franc Trust (FXF, C+).Euro ETF OptionsMoreCurrency ETFs attempt to replicate the movements of a currency on the foreign exchange market against  a basket or single currency and can be a great holding for investors who are well versed in the political and economic landscape of the country.

The euro fund has not seen strong inflows since the beginning of the crisis, with 2013 finally providing strong returns. The United Kingdom has also fallen on hard times, neither significantly attracting or losing investors over the last five years. FXF, however, has not had a consistent year, volleying between strong inflows and outflows each year. The most important point illustrated here is that currencies can be extremely volatile due to high speculation and sensitivity to news; as such, investors should closely monitor global news, both scheduled and unscheduled, to stay on top of short- and long-term events that can shape future trends.Follow me on Twitter @lynpaintzall[For more ETF analysis, make sure to sign up for our free ETF newsletter]Disclosure: No positions at time of writing.Click here to read the original article on ETFdb.com.Related Posts:The Ultimate Guide To Currency ETF TradingCurrencyShares Singapore Dollar Trust (FXSG) Rolls Out British Pound ETF Continues Slide After Bearish Data ReportsCentral Bank “March Mayhem” Puts Currency ETFs in FocusHow Volatile Is Your Currency ETF?
