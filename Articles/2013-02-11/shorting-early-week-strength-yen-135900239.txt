Daily Technicals (all USD crosses, gold, crude)Other TA (crosses, COT, etc.)FOREX Trading and Technical Analysis ObservationsThe EURJPY, CHFJPY, AUDJPY, CADJPY, and NZDJPY carved out Weekly J Spike Reversals. As such, I’d like to short early week strength in Yen crosses. Levels of interest as resistance are 12556-12606 EURJPY, 10208/45 CHFJPY, 9628/55 AUDJPY, 9325/54 CADJPY, and 7819/48 NZDJPY.My trading will focus on EURJPY and AUDJPY but AUDJPY is probably the best play as per EURAUD structure (bullish) and AUDUSD structure (bearish). On that front, I’ll be looking to return to a long EURAUD position this week – I’d like to see an up day above trendline support before going back in.
