Ahn, a director at Hyundai's America Group, said.Hyundai saw its U.S. sales rise only 2 percent from January to October, underperforming the market, due to rising competition, capacity constraints and its ageing Sonata sedans.Hyundai said in January that it aimed to raise U.S. sales by 4 percent to 734,000 vehicles this year.(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)
