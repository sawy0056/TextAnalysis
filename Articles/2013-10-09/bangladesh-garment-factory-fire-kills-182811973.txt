He said firefighters were still working to bring the blaze under control in one of those buildings. He could not immediately say whether any people were trapped.The cause of the fire was not immediately known.Harsh and often unsafe working conditions exist in Bangladesh's garment industry, where numerous fatal accidents have occurred. The collapse of an eight-story factory building in April killed more than 1,100 people, and a fire last November killed 112 workers.Bangladesh earns $20 billion a year from garment exports, mainly to the United States and Europe.
