Earlier this week BMW unveiled a new Mini to be built at its Oxford motorworks.More than 80 percent of the cars built in Britain are destined for export, but the vast bulk of the rise in production this year has been driven by domestic demand aided by cheap finance deals and rising consumer confidence.SMMT figures earlier this month showed that car sales in Britain so far this year are 10.2 percent higher than at the same point in 2012, making the country a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy European landscape for auto sales.(Reporting by David Milliken; Editing by Pravin Char)
