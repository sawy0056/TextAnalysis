Many Facebook users received an email notice last night about a pending settlement in a class action lawsuit against the company.This is the same email that went out to some Facebook users last week, but we wanted to mention it again in case there was any confusion.The suit says Facebook used users' photos and other information without their permission to display sponsored stories, a form of advertising in your News Feed. That's a big no-no, according to the suit. Here's an excerpt of the email some Facebook users got last night:The Action claims that Facebook unlawfully used the names, profile pictures, photographs, likenesses, and identities of Facebook users in the United States to advertise or sell products and services through Sponsored Stories without obtaining those users' consent. Facebook denies any wrongdoing and any liability whatsoever. No court or other entity has made any judgment or other determination of any liability.If you got the email, it's likely your profile information was used in sponsored story.So here's what you can do to get your payday. Go to the Facebook settlement page and fill out a claim form. If the suit is successful, you can get as much as $10, which is enough to buy you a Starbucks latte and half a muffin.Filling out the form is no guarantee you'll see the cash. The entire settlement is for $20 million, and if too many people file a claim, all that money will go to charity instead. Don't get greedy.More From Business Insider There's Just No Good Reason For Facebook Stock To Explode Higher From HereMarketers Shift Ad Budgets Into Social MediaFacebook Reaches Mobile Tipping Point
