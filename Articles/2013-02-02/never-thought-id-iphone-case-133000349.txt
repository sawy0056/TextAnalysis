I'm a pragmatist when it comes to my personal technology.I like things to be out of the way until I need them and to not scream for attention all the time.So being the guy with a plain unobtrusive black case for everything, you can imagine how I might feel about a brightly-colored case made entirely from wood, like Rocketcases' "Woody" case.But two days after putting it on my phone, it's still there. I love it.Without being any thicker than other cases, the Woody is simple, lightweight, and doesn't creep over the top of your phone. The entire surface of your screen is untouched – compare this to other cases like Speck's PixelSkin.And did I mention that it's made of wood?! It might be gimmicky, but I ended up really getting a kick out of it. The case is laser-cut from a single piece of wood that snaps together in two parts over your phone. At no point did it seem like it might accidentally come undone.Of course all your buttons and ports are readily accessible – volume, headphones, camera, and the like.I knew Rocketcases was sending me some review models of its products. I had no idea my new iPhone case of choice would be among them.You can buy The Woody here for $35.Click here for even more great iPhone cases >More From Business Insider A Really Good Guess At What An iPhone With A Big Screen Could Look LikeScore!
