And this data reveals where the current expansion continues to draw resources from: those who had been out of the workforce altogether.Nick Bunker, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, noted Tuesday that in November just under 75% of all employment gains accrued to those who had been outside the labor market.“This recovery has steadily pulled workers back into the labor force and moves straight into employment from the sidelines have been an important part of that story,” Bunker said.“The labor force participation rate of prime-age workers is still more than a percentage point below its peak back in 2000, suggesting that roughly 1.5 million prime-age workers are currently out of the labor force and could move into employment.”View photosWorkers are going from out of the labor force to employed at a record pace, showing how this economic recovery continues to benefit workers who had been left behind after the crisis. (Source: Indeed, BLS)MoreSince hitting a generational low of 80.7% in August 2015, the labor force participation rate among prime-age workers has now hit a 10-year high of 82.8%. And as Bunker notes, this prime-age participation rate still indicates plenty of slack in this labor market remains.Those who hadn’t been working or looking for work moving right into the ranks of the gainfully employed is a part of repairing this participation dynamic. And these flows also speak directly to one of the biggest labor market themes Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has hit on during recent press conferences. Which is disenfranchised workers finally getting a look.“People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities,” Powell said in December.“Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of education. These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.”As this longest-ever economic expansion continues and economists and investors marvel at monthly headline job gains, data underneath the surface makes these gains more explicable.And at least in part reveals why the Fed likely won’t be tempted to change its policy stance anytime soon.By Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round. Follow him @MylesUdlandWhat to watch todayEconomy8:15 a.m. ET: ADP employment change, December (160,000 expected, 67,000 in November)EarningsPre-market6:30 a.m. ET: Constellation Brands (STZ) 7 a.m. ET: Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Post-market4:15 p.m. ET: Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)Read more Top NewsView photosIran Retaliates With Missile Strike on U.S.-Iraqi BasesMoreIran retaliates with missile strike on U.S.-Iraqi bases [Bloomberg]Boeing 737 crashes after take-off in Iran, killing all aboard [Reuters]Story continuesAirline stocks drop as problems mount for Boeing and oil rises [Yahoo Finance UK]Oil prices rise as Iran strikes US-led forces in Iraq [Yahoo Finance UK]Carlos Ghosn's career options [Yahoo Finance]YAHOO FINANCE HIGHLIGHTSIRS adds specific crypto question to 2019 tax formMarkets will breathe a ‘sigh of relief’ if Trump is re-elected, veteran strategist explainsMeet the former UPS box handler now in charge of the Small Business AdministrationFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergOil-rich Alberta sees lower budget deficit in 2020-21, bets on recovery in crude pricesReutersWhy a Top Trump Aide Said 'We Are Desperate' for More ImmigrantsThe New York TimesU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersOne million Britons will be on zero-hour contracts by end of 2020The ConversationBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
