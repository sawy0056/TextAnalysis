In comparison, iPhone sales fell 14% to $142.4 billion in the same period.Apple keeps between 15% and 30% of the sales through its App Store, depending on whether users buy software as a one-time purchase or recurring subscription.The company launched several new services in 2019, including the streaming service, a video game service and a credit card.Shares of the company were marginally down in early trading.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Neha Malara; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Patrick Graham)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBaidu Becomes Latest Tech Giant to Deliver Disappointing OutlookBloombergApple's keyboard cover for the next iPad Pro could add a trackpadEngadgetAMD, Apple, Intel lead Silicon Valley stock sell-off as coronavirus fears in U.S. growAmerican City Business JournalsDow Plunges 1,200 Points As Stock Market Melts Down Again On Coronavirus FearsInvestor's Business DailyBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
