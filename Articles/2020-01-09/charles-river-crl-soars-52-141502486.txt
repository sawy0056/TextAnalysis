A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Charles River has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 16.3X versus its peer group's average of 14.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.74. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front.
