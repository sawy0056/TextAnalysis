On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Joyce Corporation Ltd (ASX:JYC).Do Insider Transactions Matter?It is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise. View our latest analysis for Joyce The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At JoyceOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider John Westwood for AU$409k worth of shares, at about AU$1.54 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than AU$1.48 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.Joyce insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. They paid about AU$1.36 on average. It's great to see insiders putting their own cash into the company's stock, albeit at below the recent share price.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.
