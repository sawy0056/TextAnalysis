We'll show how you can use Netcompany Group A/S's (CPH:NETC) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Netcompany Group has a P/E ratio of 45.87. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 2.2%. View our latest analysis for Netcompany Group How Do I Calculate Netcompany Group's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Netcompany Group:P/E of 45.87 = DKK308.60 ÷ DKK6.73 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each DKK1 of company earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Netcompany Group Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Netcompany Group has a higher P/E than the average (33.1) P/E for companies in the software industry.CPSE:NETC Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreNetcompany Group's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Netcompany Group's 118% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. Even better, EPS is up 142% per year over three years. So you might say it really deserves to have an above-average P/E ratio. Regrettably, the longer term performance is poor, with EPS down 51% per year over 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Is Debt Impacting Netcompany Group's P/E?Netcompany Group's net debt is 6.1% of its market cap. So it doesn't have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On Netcompany Group's P/E RatioNetcompany Group trades on a P/E ratio of 45.9, which is above its market average of 15.7. While the company does use modest debt, its recent earnings growth is superb. So on this analysis a high P/E ratio seems reasonable.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
