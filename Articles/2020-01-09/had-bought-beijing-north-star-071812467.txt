But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. For example, the Beijing North Star Company Limited (HKG:588) share price is up 29% in the last year, clearly besting the market return of around 8.0% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! However, the stock hasn't done so well in the longer term, with the stock only up 4.4% in three years. See our latest analysis for Beijing North Star There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last twelve months, Beijing North Star actually shrank its EPS by 11%.Given the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.For starters, we suspect the share price has been buoyed by the dividend, which was increased during the year. Income-seeking investors probably helped bid up the stock price. Though we must add that the revenue growth of 7.4% year on year would have helped paint a pretty picture.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).SEHK:588 Income Statement, January 8th 2020MoreIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Beijing North Star's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Beijing North Star, it has a TSR of 36% for the last year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Beijing North Star has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 36% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 3.8% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
