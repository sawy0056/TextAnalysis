And, we also discovered areas where we could improve enrollment management practices to more effectively recruit and retain students…. Working with Gray was extremely valuable and the work will continue to support our overall growth and success in future years."In 2019, Gray also expanded its partnerships with leaders in the higher-education sector.  These relationships now include BKD CPAs & Advisors, Jenzabar, and collaboration with recognized expert and author, William F. Massy, whose new book, Resource Management for Colleges and Universities will be coming out in April. Robert Atkins added, "I am delighted to announce that Peter Starrett and Zach Paz have been promoted to Partner.  Pete and Zach are the backbone of the firm; their hard work, creativity, and loyalty have been vital to our success. They are now focused on upgrading our data, systems, and analyses for you—keep an eye out for these enhanced capabilities early in the new year."About Gray Associates Gray helps colleges and universities make data-informed decisions about their academic programs.
