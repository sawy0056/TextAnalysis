To keep it practical, we'll show how Møns Bank A/S's (CPH:MNBA) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Møns Bank has a P/E ratio of 8.02. That means that at current prices, buyers pay DKK8.02 for every DKK1 in trailing yearly profits. Check out our latest analysis for Møns Bank How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Møns Bank:P/E of 8.02 = DKK119.50 ÷ DKK14.90 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each DKK1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Møns Bank Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. The image below shows that Møns Bank has a higher P/E than the average (7.1) P/E for companies in the banks industry.CPSE:MNBA Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Møns Bank shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Møns Bank's earnings per share fell by 22% in the last twelve months.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Is Debt Impacting Møns Bank's P/E?Møns Bank's net debt is 11% of its market cap. This could bring some additional risk, and reduce the number of investment options for management; worth remembering if you compare its P/E to businesses without debt.The Bottom Line On Møns Bank's P/E RatioMøns Bank's P/E is 8.0 which is below average (15.7) in the DK market. With only modest debt, it's likely the lack of EPS growth at least partially explains the pessimism implied by the P/E ratio.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
