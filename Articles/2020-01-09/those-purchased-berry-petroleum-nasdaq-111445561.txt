But that doesn't change the reality of under-performance over the last twelve months. In fact the stock is down 10% in the last year, well below the market return. Check out our latest analysis for Berry Petroleum While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the last year Berry Petroleum grew its earnings per share, moving from a loss to a profit.We're surprised that the share price is lower given that improvement. If the company can sustain the earnings growth, this might be an inflection point for the business, which would make right now a really interesting time to study it more closely.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:BRY Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Berry Petroleum's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Berry Petroleum, it has a TSR of -5.6% for the last year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveGiven that the market gained 27% in the last year, Berry Petroleum shareholders might be miffed that they lost 5.6% (even including dividends) . While the aim is to do better than that, it's worth recalling that even great long-term investments sometimes underperform for a year or more. It's great to see a nice little 0.7% rebound in the last three months. This could just be a bounce because the selling was too aggressive, but fingers crossed it's the start of a new trend.
