The most recent quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share was increased 19% from the same quarter last year.Another advantage is that Bank OZK has more room to grow than the mega-cap bank stocks. Bank OZK has a market capitalization of $4 billion. Its service territory mainly includes Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas and Texas, but it also has locations in five other states.Bank OZK has a very strong history of growth, compounding earnings at a 22% annual rate from 2009 to 2018. The bank has generated strong growth due to a combination of organic and acquired growth. Even in a challenging environment for banks this year, with interest rates on the decline throughout 2019, Bank OZK has still generated growth. Over the first three quarters of 2019, diluted earnings per share increased 7.2% from the first nine months of 2018.See also: Top Picks 2020: Cisco Systems (CSCO)While valuations have increased across the financial sector, Bank OZK remains a modestly valued stock. Shares trade for a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.Bank OZK is a smaller regional bank, and it is a more attractive choice for income investors as it offers a 3.1% dividend yield.We believe the valuation could expand in 2020, while earnings and dividend should continue to grow. As long as the U.S. economy avoids recession, Bank OZK could be among the top financial stocks to buy for 2020.More From MoneyShow.com:Top Picks 2020: Alphabet (GOOGL)Top Picks 2020: Americold Realty Trust (COLD)Top Picks 2020: Signet Jewelers (SIG)Top Picks 2020: Boeing Company (BA)Top Picks 2020: Best Buy (BBY)Top Picks 2020: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextChina Set to Release Biggest Insight into Virus-Hit EconomyBloombergStocks Fall Most Since August 2011 on Virus Angst: Markets WrapBloombergBank of America economist forecasts ‘gloom not doom’ for global economyMarketWatch2020 Businesswoman of the Year: How she went from blindsided to emboldenedAmerican City Business JournalsEurope’s economy braces for coronavirus hit as market panic gripsYahoo Finance UKBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
