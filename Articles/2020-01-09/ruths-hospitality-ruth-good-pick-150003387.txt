After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value? One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Ruth’s Hospitality Group, Inc. RUTH stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Ruth’s Hospitality has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.57, as you can see in the chart below:View photosThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.23. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Ruth’s Hospitality’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 19.6 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.View photosFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 28.86. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.View photosStory continuesWe should also point out that Ruth’s Hospitality has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.69, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Ruth’s Hospitality stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings. Right now, Ruth’s Hospitality has a P/S ratio of about 1.39. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.View photosIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Ruth’s Hospitality currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Ruth’s Hospitality a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too. For example, the PEG ratio for Ruth’s Hospitality is just 1.09, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2.08. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, RUTH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles. What About the Stock Overall?Though Ruth’s Hospitality might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of B. This gives RUTH a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been decent at best. The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the next year estimate has seen one up and none down in the same time period. This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current and next year consensus estimate have risen by 0.7% each in the past two months. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Ruth's Hospitality Group, Inc. Price and ConsensusView photosRuth's Hospitality Group, Inc.
