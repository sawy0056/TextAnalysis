We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Intertainment AG's (ETR:ITN), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research.

is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Intertainment:P/E of 31.76 = €0.42 ÷ €0.01 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each €1 the company has earned over the last year. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Intertainment Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company.

When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Intertainment's earnings per share fell by 59% in the last twelve months.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).How Does Intertainment's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Intertainment's net debt is 58% of its market cap.
