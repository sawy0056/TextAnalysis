Both Ukrainian and Iranian officials indicated that they suspected a mechanical issue.Hopes that these attacks would be the end of the direct military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran were boosted by a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump that “all is well” and that he would be making a statement later in the day. The Iranian foreign minister also indicated that his country did not seek an escalation of the conflict and that their response had been ”proportionate”.As investors digest the possible deescalation of the conflict, thoughts turn back to the country’s underlying economic circumstances. The recent non-manufacturing ISM index showed continued strength from the dominant services sector while the Federal Reserve is widely expected to remain on the sidelines at its meeting latest this month after easing interest rates three times last year.With this in mind, investors will look forward to the release of the ADP non-farm employment release for December later today. This is often used as a gauge as to how Friday's key employment data looks. It is expected to show continued employment growth with 160,000 more jobs added, compared with 67,000 jobs added the previous month.Related ArticlesWalgreens first-quarter profit falls nearly 25% on higher costsFutures steady as Iran retaliation seen as containedApple's news service reaches 100 million users, App Store sales expandReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNations take drastic measures as coronavirus outbreak spreadsMarketWatchCycling race canceled with 2 virus cases, Froome quarantinedThe Associated PressKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergStephen Colbert, Trevor Noah Get Religion On The Coronavirus OutbreakDeadlineAt least 7 Iranian government officials have coronavirusThe WeekBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
