For counter-cyclical measures the government needs fiscal space and the present conditions are appropriate to invoke the escape clause," the official said late on Tuesday.The government in its budget in July had proposed to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3.3% in the current fiscal year ending March 2020 and then reduce it further to 3% in 2020/21.Most economists and market participants however see the current year's fiscal deficit touching 3.7-3.8% of the GDP, as growth has slowed drastically with the Indian economy expanding just 4.5% in the July-September quarter, its weakest pace since 2013.A spokesman for the Finance Ministry did not respond to requests for comments.India needs to grow at about 8% a year to create enough jobs for the millions of youth joining the labour force each year, yet many economists see the current slowdown continuing for another year or two, underlining the case for urgent reforms."GST revenues are low, direct tax collections have fallen. To say the government is going to maintain a 3.3% fiscal deficit in the current circumstances is unrealistic," the official said.The government needs to spend in order to boost the economy as monetary policy actions alone have done little to revive credit demand and restart the growth engines.The central bank has cut interest rates by 135 basis points since last February, but that has had little impact on growth.(Reporting by Swati Bhat; Additional reporting by Aftab Ahmed; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIndependent media in the firing line in CubaAFPBullets and defiance: Inside Guinea's opposition strongholdAFPFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergJapan scrambles for workarounds after Abe urges March school shutdown to stem coronavirusReutersAt least 7 Iranian government officials have coronavirusThe WeekBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
