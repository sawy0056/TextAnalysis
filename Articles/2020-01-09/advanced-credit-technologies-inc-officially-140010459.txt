The Company has multiple opportunities for CyberloQ in the Debit/Credit Card, Digital Payments space, in Europe and Asia to complement its domestic Pinnacle VISA Card platform in the U.S. In addition to that, we are introducing CyberloQ-Vault with several Title Companies who are sending sensitive data to multiple recipients via email to eliminate the risk of FRAUD. Email phishing and hacking of highly sensitive e-mails have also become a prevalent problem in Europe, Asia, as well as here in the U.S. The CyberloQ vault which is encrypted, would virtually replace this area of conventional vulnerability in emails, rendering would be hackers useless and eliminate the email process in its entirety.  The Company also has engaged in multiple re-seller agreements to cross-market several products in the Cyber-Security field.Safe Harbor: From time to time, the Company may issue news releases that contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is subject to the safe harbor created by those sections.
