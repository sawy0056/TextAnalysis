This report assesses core public safety technology and solutions as well as emerging key areas for critical communications and decision support including 5G, AI, and IoT. The report includes forecasts for the public and personal safety market globally and regionally from 2020 to 2025 as well as analysis and recommendations for industry stakeholders.Select Report FindingsGlobal market for public and personal safety market poised to reach USD $532B by 2027Biometric security and authentication systems will have the highest CAGR during the forecasted periodNorth America will lead the public safety and personal safety market followed by Asia Pac and EuropePublic safety LTE and upcoming 5G network will make substantial positive impacts on public safety systemsEnterprise safety and security solutions will lead the market in terms of new technology introduction and solution realizationTraditionally, the public safety community consists of first responders (ambulance/EMS, police, and fire), 9-1-1 dispatch/PSAP (Public Safety Answer Points), and infrastructure/service providers such as Comtech Telecommunications Corp. and Intrado. With Public Safety LTE and the roll-out of FirstNet, public safety services have expanded to include improved communications infrastructure as compared to legacy land mobile radio systems.The public safety community increasingly relies upon IP-based solutions for first responders and dispatch communications as well as overall coordination in the event of emergencies and disaster impact mitigation. Next-generation enterprise safety solutions enable the ability to identify and locate those in distress, direct emergency communications, and notify need-to-know personnel.Advancements in LTE and the introduction of 5G are expected to provide improved first responder communications, coordination, and safety. Further enhancements are expected through the integration of next-generation public safety solutions such as augmented reality for first responders and virtual reality coupled with haptic awareness and control for remote public safety personnel. In addition, advancements in public safety real-time data and decision support systems will provide life-saving and property protecting information for field personnel and coordinators alike. Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for public safety is also important for the future of public safety as remote sensors will be increasingly relied upon to predict and prevent threats as well as provide invaluable situational awareness tools for emergency services personnel.Many of these technologies will ultimately be integrated into public safety systems. However, personal safety and enterprise public safety will lead the way in terms of technology adoption, systems integration, and solution deployment. For example, leading companies such as IP communications provider, Bandwidth, deploy enterprise 9-1-1 and safety systems for business that includes integration with unified communications by way of telecom APIs.In another leading company example, NICE Systems provides security organizations and emergency services to protect people and assets. They do this in a multi-facet manner that includes anticipation and management of safety and security risks with solutions that help organizations mitigate threats to operations. We see leading vendors focused on enterprise safety and security will be the primary area for integration of next-generation solutions involving AI, data analytics, IoT, and immersive technologies. The challenges will be to use a systems integration approach to tie together technologies in a manner in which useful solutions will seamlessly operate with existing command, control, and communications without unintended consequences such as introducing new system security and/or reliability threats or points of failure respectively.Key Topics Covered1.
