The masquerade-themed fete hosted donors, members, families, and VIPS such as Councilman Curren D. Price Jr. (The New 9th), CeCe Peniston (Multi-Award-winning artist), Celeste Thorson (How I Met Your Mother), Comedian Patrik Neil, Emmy Award-winning Host Dr. Lisa Masterson (The Doctors), Paloma Morales (Valentina), Faith Rogers (Surviving R Kelly), Nadia Dawn (ITA Canadian Model), and more.Echoes of Hope served as Legacy Charitable Foundation's beneficiary for the 2019 Gala. Striving to awaken the spirit of hope in the lives of children, youth, and young adults in need by alleviating barriers and helping them reach their full potential, the non-profit was founded in 2007 by Stacia and Luc Robitaille."As I made it a personal responsibility to spread the word for this great cause, I was amazed by the number of employees, clients, vendors, and daily acquaintances I speak with who have grown up in our Foster Care. These are people who had never shared this information until the topic was brought up through fundraising efforts. We cannot let a social issue as important as this to continue being overlooked because of a lack of manpower to make a dent in the problem facing our communities. One child at a time, we can make a difference." ~ Pedram Abraham Mehrian, Chairman & President of Strategic Legacy Investment Group, IncRolling Cart catering delighted palates with sushi; mango kale and Chinese chicken salads; rice pilaf; rosemary potatoes and seasonal vegetables; roasted duck and chicken, broiled salmon, beef stroganoff and more. Crystal Bartenders provided a vibrant bar with signature drinks such as "Legacy," "CeCe," and "GiveBack." The flare-tenders pumped up partygoers midway through the event with a fire tower act that set the bar sizzling in preparation for the live entertainment to finish out the night.Soul Train Music Award-nominee, 3x ASCAP & WMC award-winner, Billboard Music Video & BMI award-winner, Cece Peniston took to the stage and swept everyone out of their seats and onto the dance floor for a once in a lifetime performance."The gala was filled with over-pouring emotion and truth. I hope our mission to help foster disadvantaged youth was equally instilled in everyone's hearts, just as much as it was in ours. The real-life experiences shared by our two guest speakers, Wendy and Jesse, portrayed why we have to consciously support foster youth and breathe hope into them for a better shot at life. Many of them live silently and quietly suffer the cards they have been dealt with since birth. Not all of them are lucky enough to get the assistance and support they need because what they do not know they cannot seek. It is my mission in life through the Foundation and organizations like Echoes of Hope, to help foster youth become better than the sum of their parts. By creating programs to mentor, house, and help in their education, over time, our efforts will make a positive impact on their lives. As of now, we are doing all that we can to give foster youth a platform with a voice that is heard. Through fundraising donations and supporting programs, we are their only hope."    ~ Jennifer Brown, Executive Director of The Legacy Charitable FoundationAward recipients included Councilman Curren D. Price Jr. (Special Honorary Award); Sylvia Valdivia, Mario Garcia, Celia Orozco, Mary Zavala, and Karla Silva (Legacy Golden Heart Awards); Abraham Mehrian, Jose Villalpando, and Michael Sabet (Colonnade Leadership Circle Donor Awards); CeCe Peniston (Legacy Diamond Heart Award); Sarah Marie Chaput and Katie Vega (Make a Difference Awards); Marisol Arias and Jose Beltran (Special Recognition Award).Story continuesThe Legacy Charitable Foundation looks forward to adding more events to its calendar and moving offices to a bigger space in 2020.
