By using government purchases as a fuel to fund innovation, we can create more opportunities for small and medium enterprises, and ultimately help those who need help the most…our constituents. Events like this give us hope given the leaders involved and how they are championing these efforts," said Sharma.To read more about the event and the roundtable members, see Public Spend Forum's International Roundtable on Innovation and Emerging Tech in Government.About Public Spend Forum Public Spend Forum aims to create "open government markets" for $10 trillion in government spending through a platform that provides data, services and an open global community Public Spend Forum's key products/services include GovShop, a supplier intelligence platform; training and workshops focused on procurement innovation; and a global community and ecosystem where government, suppliers and other ecosystem partners can engage to solve problems.
