(NASDAQ:DHIL) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Diamond Hill Investment Group. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. The company also returned around 7.1% of its market capitalisation to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks over the past year. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Diamond Hill Investment Group for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis NasdaqGS:DHIL Historical Dividend Yield, January 8th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that of Diamond Hill Investment Group's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Diamond Hill Investment Group's latest financial position,

For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Diamond Hill Investment Group's dividend payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$10.00 in 2010, compared to US$9.00 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 1.0% a year during that period. Diamond Hill Investment Group's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 1.0% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.When a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. It's good to see Diamond Hill Investment Group has been growing its earnings per share at 14% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a good rate, and the company is paying less than half its earnings as dividends. We generally think this is an attractive combination, as it permits further reinvestment in the business.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Firstly, we like that Diamond Hill Investment Group has a low and conservative payout ratio. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Diamond Hill Investment Group has a credible record on several fronts, but falls slightly short of our standards for a dividend stock.Now, if you want to look closer, it would be worth checking out our free research on Diamond Hill Investment Group management tenure, salary, and performance.If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of dividend stocks yielding above 3%.If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
