It supports more than 50 trading pairs, including bitcoin (BTC)-U.S. dollar (USD), ether (ETH)-USD and XRP-USD.The launch of the Android app follows Coinbase Pro’s iOS app in October. Linda Xie, product manager at Coinbase Pro, said: “In just over eight weeks, we’ve seen hundreds of millions in trade volume via the mobile platform.”Orders made via the apps carry the same fees as those executed via the desktop platform, Xie added.While the Coinbase platform is for “everyone,” Coinbase Pro is for “experts,” the exchange's CEO, Brian Armstrong, once said. “All assets listed on any of our products are subject to our digital asset framework, but some assets listed on Coinbase Pro may be more appropriate for experienced traders due to, for example, higher volatility or less volume than assets listed on Coinbase,” he explained at the time. ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next‘Robot’ was coined 100 years ago, in a play predicting human extinction by android handsTechCrunch'Dead by Daylight Mobile' to launch worldwide in Spring 2020AFP Relax NewsBrazil's XP says trading platform facing problemsReutersFebruary Gains Disappear as Bitcoin Drops Below $9kCoindeskCould you live with this budget Android for four years?EngadgetBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
