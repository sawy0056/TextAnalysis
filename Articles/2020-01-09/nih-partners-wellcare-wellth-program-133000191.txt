Using the Wellth smartphone app, members enrolled in the program are reminded to take their medications each day, and certain members are eligible to earn financial rewards in the form of gift cards for adopting healthy behaviors such as low-sodium diets and adhering to their daily prescription drug regimens."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates non-adherence causes 30 to 50% of chronic disease treatment failures and more than 125,000 deaths in the United States each year," said Dr. Richard Petrucci, WellCare's chief medical officer in New York. "At WellCare, we're honored to work with the NIH and to partner with Wellth to help our members address their hypertension, adhere to their care plans, and improve their overall health and well-being.""We are excited to partner with WellCare to help motivate and incentivize Medicaid members in New York to adopt healthier behaviors to better manage their hypertension," said Matt Loper, CEO of Wellth.

Upon program completion, NIH, which is funding the program, will review all program results.
