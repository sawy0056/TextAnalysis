Organizations can more closely monitor and evaluate the real-time movement of all their freight via one platform and take corrective action before any potential supply chain disruptions occur. Using this robust, automated solution, companies of all sizes can eliminate the need for time-consuming and ineffective check calls with carriers to determine load location details, streamline transportation operations, and improve communication about in-transit freight across the supply chain. “We’re pleased to help ALS gain better insight into the movement of their customers' shipments and be more proactive in addressing delivery exceptions as they occur,” said Robert Derin, Director of Operations at Descartes. “Descartes MacroPoint provides real-time shipment visibility and gives 3PLs a more complete view of their transportation operations, allowing them to focus on exceptions, better understand the flow of freight and keep customers informed of their deliveries.”About Automated Logistics SystemsWhat is now Automated Logistics Systems (ALS) started before the Great Depression as Parker Motor Freight (PMF).
