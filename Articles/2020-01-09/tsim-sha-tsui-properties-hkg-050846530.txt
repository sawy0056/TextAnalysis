And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Tsim Sha Tsui Properties Limited (HKG:247) shareholders have enjoyed a 35% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 0.3% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 1.0% in the last year , including dividends . See our latest analysis for Tsim Sha Tsui Properties There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Tsim Sha Tsui Properties actually saw its EPS drop 6.4% per year.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The revenue reduction of 5.1% per year is not a positive. It certainly surprises us that the share price is up, but perhaps a closer examination of the data will yield answers.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:247 Income Statement, January 8th 2020MoreIf you are thinking of buying or selling Tsim Sha Tsui Properties stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Tsim Sha Tsui Properties's TSR for the last 5 years was 54%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveTsim Sha Tsui Properties shareholders gained a total return of 1.0% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 9.0% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market.
