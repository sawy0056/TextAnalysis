Developed in close consultation with carriers and brokers, Partner Hub is the industry's first solution to offer robust functionality while also addressing brokers' and carriers' requirements for total transparency, advanced security and user controls.Industry adoption of government-mandated ELDs is in full force due to their many benefits, including superior accuracy compared to other tracking technologies and their potential to reduce driver fatigue, improve customer service, lower shipping costs, and facilitate more efficient supply chain planning. Nonetheless, many carriers and drivers are concerned about security and control of their data, as well as the value they receive in exchange for providing it."With cell phone triangulation tracking now obsolete, and mounting privacy concerns among drivers with regard to smart phone tracking apps, we saw a need for carriers to be able to securely share their ELD tracking data with third parties," said FourKites CEO Mathew Elenjickal. "FourKites is committed to giving carriers full control over their data, and enabling them to benefit materially from real-time freight logistics data - all while maintaining the transparency, security and control that they need and expect."Partner Hub includes individual onboarding tools tailored for brokers, carriers and shippers. Carriers can see, in detail, how their data is being shared and with whom. Every carrier retains total control over their data and can choose to turn off data sharing completely. FourKites, in turn, never exposes a carrier's ELD credentials to either brokers or shippers. FourKites tracks shipments - not trucks - and focuses narrowly on defined origins, appointment times and delivery times. (Read here for more on FourKites' commitment to security and ELD privacy)."As ELDs have become the industry standard, the need to connect to them effortlessly and with a high degree of trust has become a necessity," said David Broering, President, North American Non-Asset Solutions at NFI. "FourKites' Partner Hub is the tool we've been waiting for to help quickly onboard new carriers at the ELD level, sparing their drivers the effort and pain associated with app-based tracking."Once onboard FourKites, all parties can access the rich visibility data afforded by the world's largest network of global shippers - 380+ and counting - and their broker and carrier partners. Carriers and drivers gain access to FourKites' facility-level wait time data to improve scheduling and reduce dwell. Brokers, meanwhile, save time by eliminating manual check calls and emails, as well as reduce reliance on app-based tracking."FourKites gives us the ability to manage ELD onboarding in a way that provides the security our carrier base is looking for," said George Henry, SVP of Logistics at USA Truck, Inc. "Just as important, it gives value back to the carrier and incentivizes them to do more business with us. It's a win for everyone."Since launching six years ago, FourKites has pioneered the industry shift to real-time visibility, enabling shippers to improve on-time delivery and orchestrate their supply chains based on actionable data and predictive intelligence. With a network that now includes more than 380 of the world's top shippers, including 18 of the top-20 food and beverage companies and nine of the top-10 CPG companies, FourKites tracks more than 600,000 shipments every day.About FourKites FourKites is the largest predictive supply chain visibility platform, delivering real-time visibility and predictive analytics for the broadest network of Global 1000 companies and third-party logistics firms.
