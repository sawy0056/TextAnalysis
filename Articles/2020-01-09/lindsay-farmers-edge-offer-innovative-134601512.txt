The company remains focused on its strategy to expand global reach with FieldNET Advisor. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2019, the company released access to satellite imagery for all FieldNET Advisor customers. Interest in FieldNET Advisor continues to rise as evident from an improvement of 78% in the number of year-over-year subscriptions. Lindsay has also introduced Field NET Pivot Watch, a low-cost solar-powered remote telemetry device that mounts onto any central pivot irrigation system.Nevertheless, agricultural markets have been affected by lower commodity prices and reduced exports as a result of the long-standing U.S-China trade dispute and the weakening currency.
