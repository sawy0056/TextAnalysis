This has never been done in the history of this country,” he said. Najib did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the recordings.Najib faces 42 criminal charges in five separate trials related to the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB, the subject of investigations in at least six countries including the United States, Singapore, and Switzerland. He has plead not guilty.Malaysian and U.S. authorities say about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars was misappropriated from 1MDB, co-founded by Najib in 2009.Latheefa told a news conference that the audio recordings raised issues such as "abuse of power, criminal conspiracy, obstruction of justice, compromising national security, fabrication of false evidence through foreign aides and connivance”.In one recording, Najib allegedly asked the crown prince to help fabricate a loan agreement to show that Najib’s stepson, Riza Aziz, had received financing from UAE state fund International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) and not from money siphoned from 1MDB.“The premise is relatively small, if there can be an agreement with Sheikh Mansour to have a loan agreement signed… that will show that it is a legitimate financing package, it’s not money laundering,” Najib allegedly said on the audio clip, referring to UAE deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who was then chairman of IPIC.A lawyer for Riza, whose firm produced 2013 Hollywood movie The Wolf of Wall Street, did not respond to a request for comment. UAE fund Mubadala Investment Co., formed after a merger between IPIC and Mubadala Development Co. in 2017, declined to comment.(Fixes typo in headline)(Reporting by Rozanna Latiff and Joseph Sipalan; additional reporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh in Dubai; Editing by Michael Perry)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextStudents Step Up Protests Against Thailand’s Army-Backed PremierBloombergSoundtrack City: How Nashville is awash in film, game scoresAssociated PressStreaming services accounted for nearly 80% of all music revenue in 2019TechCrunchMalaysia's Mahathir wants nonpartisan gov't if picked as PMAssociated PressBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
