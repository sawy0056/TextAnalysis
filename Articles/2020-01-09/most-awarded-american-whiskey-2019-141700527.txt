The Uncle Nearest brand, an all minority-led business wholly owned by Uncle Nearest, Inc., encompasses a premium aged expression featuring a blend of 8- to 14-year old whiskeys, an 11-year-old minimum single barrel whiskey, and a 7-year-old small batch offering, all mellowed using the Lincoln County Process, a unique filtering of bourbon through sugar maple charcoal. This process is confirmed to have been brought to Tennessee by enslaved people and taught by Nearest Green to the most famous Tennessee Whiskey maker of all time. Uncle Nearest is distilled, aged, bottled and hand-labeled in Tennessee.The brand was built on its knack for sourcing the best of Tennessee Whiskeys and Bourbons, and using its own non-temperature-controlled aging process and unique post-aging double filtration method that significantly changes the characteristics and profile of the original whiskeys. Uncle Nearest is the most awarded new American whiskey brand in United States history, garnering 72 awards since its July 2017 debut, including being one of two brands named "World's Best" at Whisky Magazine's 2019 World Whiskies Awards, and earning 15 Best in Class honors.
