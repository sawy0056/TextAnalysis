And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. Don't believe it? Then look at the AEM Holdings Ltd (SGX:AWX) share price. It's 2254% higher than it was five years ago. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. On top of that, the share price is up 77% in about a quarter.Anyone who held for that rewarding ride would probably be keen to talk about it. See our latest analysis for AEM Holdings To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years of share price growth, AEM Holdings moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. We can see that the AEM Holdings share price is up 1188% in the last three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 61% per year. Notably, the EPS growth has been slower than the annualised share price gain of 134% over three years. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).SGX:AWX Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how AEM Holdings has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of AEM Holdings, it has a TSR of 2541% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that AEM Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 144% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 92%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. Is AEM Holdings cheap compared to other companies?
