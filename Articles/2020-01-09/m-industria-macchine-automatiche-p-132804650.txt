(BIT:IMA) Be Valuable To Income Investors?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we'll take a closer look at I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche S.p.A. (BIT:IMA) from a dividend investor's perspective. Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis BIT:IMA Historical Dividend Yield, January 8th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 54% of I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche paid out 59% of its cash flow as dividends last year, which is within a reasonable range for the average corporation. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Is I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche's Balance Sheet Risky?As I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche is carrying net debt of 3.65 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the upper limit of our comfort range on a dividend stock that the investor hopes will endure a wide range of economic circumstances.We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 23.37 times its interest expense, I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche's interest cover is quite strong - more than enough to cover the interest expense.We update our data on I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche every 24 hours, so you can always get

Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €0.90 in 2010, compared to €2.00 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 8.3% per year over this time.Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. It's good to see I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche has been growing its earnings per share at 25% a year over the past five years. With recent, rapid earnings per share growth and a payout ratio of 54%, this business looks like an interesting prospect if earnings are reinvested effectively.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. First, we think I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche is paying out an acceptable percentage of its cashflow and profit. That said, we were glad to see it growing earnings and paying a fairly consistent dividend. I.M.A. Industria Macchine Automatiche has a number of positive attributes, but it falls slightly short of our (admittedly high) standards. Were there evidence of a strong moat or an attractive valuation, it could still be well worth a look.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
