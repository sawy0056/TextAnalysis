But not every stock you buy will perform as well as the overall market. Over the last year the Esquire Financial Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ESQ) share price is up 14%, but that's less than the broader market return. Esquire Financial Holdings hasn't been listed for long, so it's still not clear if it is a long term winner.
