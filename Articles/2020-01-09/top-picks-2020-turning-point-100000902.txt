The stock rose 73% last year. The advisor says, "If you want relatively low risk exposure to the cannabis industry, consider this one.")More From MoneyShow.com:Top Picks 2020: Alphabet (GOOGL)Top Picks 2020: Americold Realty Trust (COLD)Top Picks 2020: Signet Jewelers (SIG)Top Picks 2020: Boeing Company (BA)Top Picks 2020: Best Buy (BBY)Top Picks 2020: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
