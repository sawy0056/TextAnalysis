However, growth of the industry would be challenged by declining corn production, stringent regulations, intense competition and rising hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) demand. A few notable trends include inclining ethanol fuel stations, the emergence of Direct-Ethanol Fuel Cell, rising application of ethanol in octane industry and innovation in ethanol production.Ethanol is typically blended with unleaded gasoline to raise fuel's octane rating and reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. It is highly soluble in water and other liquid compounds, thus, it is readily used in a variety of usage ranging from household to fuel applications including fuel, food & beverage, cosmetics & personal care & chemical. and co-products i.e. distiller grains & others. Ethanol co-products (Distillers Grain, Corn Gluten Feed and Corn Gluten Meal) are obtained during the ethanol manufacturing process. Usually, because of product feature similarities, they can be used as ingredients in other production processes.The market is growing owing to changes in the consumer drinking preferences such as increasing ethanol-based beverages (beer, wines, fruits juices, cider), demand by domestic millennial population and development of domestic bio-fuel industry. Scope of the ReportThe report provides a comprehensive analysis of the U.S. Ethanol Market, segmented on the basis of Applications i.e. Fuel, Food & Beverage, Cosmetics & Personal Care & Chemical and Co-products i.e. Distiller Grains & Others.The market dynamics such as growth drivers, market trends and challenges are analysed in-depth.The competitive landscape of the market, along with the company profiles of leading players i.e. Archer Daniels Midland Company, Valero Energy Corporation, Green Plains Inc., Pacific Ethanol, Inc., The Andersons, Inc. and Cargill Inc. are also presented in detail.Key Topics Covered1.
