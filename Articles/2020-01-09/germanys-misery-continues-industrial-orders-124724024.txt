But he added that he did not expect any major consequences for growth, because Germany's domestic economy remained stable and there were signs the Sino-U.S. trade dispute was easing.Contracts for German goods decreased by 1.3% from the previous month, posting the steepest drop since July, data from the Economy Ministry showed. That confounded the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.3% rise.Demand from other countries fell 3.1%, the biggest drop since February. Orders from domestic clients rose 1.6%. The reading for October was revised up to a rise of 0.2% from a previously reported decline of 0.4%.DIHK economist Katharina Huhn said that orders from the euro zone had weakened significantly, suggesting a broader malaise in the region."In addition to the decline in foreign orders, there has also been a gradual decline in domestic demand," Huhn warned.Without bulk orders, industrial orders rose 1.0% in November, the economy ministry said, adding that incoming orders had stabilized at a low level in recent months."At the same time, business expectations in manufacturing have brightened somewhat. So the outlook for industrial activity has improved a bit," the ministry said.German business morale rose to a six-month high in December, a survey by the Ifo institute showed last month, suggesting that the German economy picked up in the fourth quarter despite manufacturing's problems.The German economy probably grew 0.5% in 2019, down from 1.5% in 2018. The statistics office releases preliminary gross domestic product growth data on Jan. 15.For 2020, the government forecasts 1.0% growth, helped by a higher number of working days. On a calendar-adjusted basis, Berlin predicts 0.6% growth this year.(Reporting by Michael Nienaber; Additional reporting by Klaus Lauer and Rene Wagner; editing by Michelle Martin, Larry King)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThyssenkrupp sells elevator unit for $18.7 billion to Advent, Cinven consortiumReutersThyssen to Sell Elevators in $19 Billion Private-Equity DealBloombergWhat's happening: Virus forges on, as world hunts solutionsAssociated PressEurope’s economy braces for coronavirus hit as market panic gripsYahoo Finance UKDortmund's 15-year-old prodigy Moukoko wanted in first team by FavreOmnisportBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
