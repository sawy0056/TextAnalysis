For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.So, the natural question for SoftOx Solutions (OB:SOFTOX-ME) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. See our latest analysis for SoftOx Solutions When Might SoftOx Solutions Run Out Of Money?A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. As at June 2019, SoftOx Solutions had cash of kr2.9m and no debt. In the last year, its cash burn was kr20m. That means it had a cash runway of around 2 months as of June 2019. It's extremely surprising to us that the company has allowed its cash runway to get that short! You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.OB:SOFTOX-ME Historical Debt, January 8th 2020MoreHow Is SoftOx Solutions's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Although SoftOx Solutions reported revenue of kr6.9m last year, it didn't actually have any revenue from operations. To us, that makes it a pre-revenue company, so we'll look to its cash burn trajectory as an assessment of its cash burn situation. As it happens, the company's cash burn reduced by 6.1% over the last year, which suggests that management may be mindful of the risks of their depleting cash reserves. SoftOx Solutions makes us a little nervous due to its lack of substantial operating revenue. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.How Hard Would It Be For SoftOx Solutions To Raise More Cash For Growth?Even though it has reduced its cash burn recently, shareholders should still consider how easy it would be for SoftOx Solutions to raise more cash in the future. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash to fund growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).SoftOx Solutions's cash burn of kr20m is about 9.3% of its kr209m market capitalisation. That's a low proportion, so we figure the company would be able to raise more cash to fund growth, with a little dilution, or even to simply borrow some money.Is SoftOx Solutions's Cash Burn A Worry?Even though its cash runway makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought SoftOx Solutions's cash burn relative to its market cap was relatively promising. After looking at that range of measures, we think shareholders should be extremely attentive to how the company is using its cash, as the cash burn makes us uncomfortable. While it's important to consider hard data like the metrics discussed above, many investors would also be interested to note that SoftOx Solutions insiders have been trading shares in the company.
