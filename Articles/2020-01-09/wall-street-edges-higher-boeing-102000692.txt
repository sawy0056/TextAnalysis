The Iranian foreign minister also indicated that his country did not seek an escalation of the conflict and that their response had been ”proportionate”.With this in mind, investors turned back towards fundamentals, with the release of the ADP employment data showing companies adding 202,000 positions to private payrolls. The total was well above the 160,000 consensus estimate and now puts the focus on the official nonfarm payrolls count that will be released Friday. Economists expect the Labor Department’s tally to show a gain of 160,000.Although the main stock indexes are all higher, some of the major individual stock movers have been lower.Boeing (NYSE:BA) weighed on the DJIA after one of its airplanes crashed shortly after taking off shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people aboard in a crash that an initial report blamed on engine failure.
