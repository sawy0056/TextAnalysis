Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Leifheit:0.067 = €11m ÷ (€217m - €49m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Leifheit has an ROCE of 6.7%.

What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Leifheit.How Leifheit's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCECurrent liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Leifheit has total assets of €217m and current liabilities of €49m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 22% of its total assets. This very reasonable level of current liabilities would not boost the ROCE by much.What We Can Learn From Leifheit's ROCEThat said, Leifheit's ROCE is mediocre, there may be more attractive investments around.
