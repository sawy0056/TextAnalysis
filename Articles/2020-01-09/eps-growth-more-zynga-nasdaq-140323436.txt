Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. Check out our latest analysis for Zynga How Quickly Is Zynga Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Zynga has managed to grow EPS by 31% per year over three years. So it's not surprising to see the company trades on a very high multiple of (past) earnings.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). While Zynga did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Zynga Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Zynga has a market capitalization of US$6.1b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$299m. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.Does Zynga Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Zynga has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership impresses me, and suggests that I'm not the only one who appreciates the EPS growth. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research. So the answer is that I do think this is a good stock to follow along with. One of Buffett's considerations when discussing businesses is if they are capital light or capital intensive. Generally, a company with a high return on equity is capital light, and can thus fund growth more easily. So you might want to check this graph comparing Zynga's ROE with industry peers (and the market at large).Story continuesYou can invest in any company you want.
