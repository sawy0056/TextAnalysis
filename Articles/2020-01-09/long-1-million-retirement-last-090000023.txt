That means Americans should plan to spend 16 years in retirement. However, many Americans lack the savings needed to survive their golden years.Conventional wisdom suggests a retirement income nest egg of at least $1 million, but the buying power of $1 million varies wildly depending on where you live. In order to determine how long $1 million will last the average retiree in every state, GOBankingRates found the total annual expenditures for people 65 and older, then factored in the cost-of-living indices in each state. Dividing a theoretical $1 million by the average retiree budget reveals the number of years that $1 million will last in every state.On average, a $1 million retirement nest egg will last 19 years, 7 months and 6 days across America. However, in some states, that time frame is significantly shorter. Data is accurate as of August 7, 2019, and is subject to change.50.

If you’re flexible on where you spend your golden years and willing to settle down in Mississippi, you might be able to stretch your retirement savings by more than an additional decade. But, if you’re dead set on spending your retirement in a beach bungalow in Hawaii, even $1 million probably isn’t going to cut it.More From GOBankingRatesWhy $1 Million Might Not Be Enough for My Retirement Dreams (or Yours) Best Online Banks of 2020  Best Checking Accounts of 2020  Retirees Confess What They Wish They’d Done With Their MoneyMethodology: GOBankingRates determined the number of years and months that $1,000,000 will last during retirement by multiplying the annual expenditures for someone 65 and older, sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Expenditure Survey for Q3 2017 through Q2 2018, by each state’s overall cost-of-living index as well as the Q1 2019 cost-of-living indices for groceries, housing, utilities, transportation and healthcare, sourced from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center.Data is accurate as of August 7, 2019, and is subject to change.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Long $1 Million in Retirement Will Last in Every StateReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
