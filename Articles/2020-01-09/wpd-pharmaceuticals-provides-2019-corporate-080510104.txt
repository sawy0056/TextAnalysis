Most patients with GBM survive less than two years from diagnosis.MelanomaMelanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer and it develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin — the pigment that gives skin its color. The global melanoma therapeutics market is expected to reach US$12.4 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Increasing incidence of chronic diseases such as melanoma, skin cancer, and skin allergies is an important driver of the market.Acute Myeloid LeukemiaAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets that transform into cancer. Unlike normal blasts, the leukemic blasts do not mature into red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. The leukemic blasts interfere with the ability of normal blasts to mature, which increases the number of blasts in the body and reduces the number of normal mature blood cells. Leukemic blasts can travel around the body through the bloodstream and interfere with the function of organs.Pancreatic CancerPancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of the pancreas — an organ in your abdomen that lies horizontally behind the lower part of your stomach. The pancreas releases enzymes that aid digestion and hormones that help manage the body’s blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer typically spreads rapidly to nearby organs and it is seldom detected in its early stages. According to the American Cancer Society, for all stages of pancreatic cancer combined, the one-year relative survival rate is 20%, and the five-year rate is 7%. These low survival rates are attributable to the fact that fewer than 20% of patients’ tumors are confined to the pancreas at the time of diagnosis; in most cases, the malignancy has already progressed to the point where surgical removal is impossible.Mariusz Olejniczak, CEO of WPD commented, “On behalf of the Board and Executive leadership team, I would like to extend best wishes for a Happy New Year!  2019 was a transformational year for WPD Pharmaceuticals, which included closing our acquisition with Westcot Ventures and listing publicly on the CSE at the end of the year. I wish to thank all our shareholders for your support and patience this year; we are ready to hit the ground running and I am looking forward to exciting things to come in 2020.” About WPD Pharmaceuticals WPD is a biotechnology research and development company with a focus on oncology, namely research and development of medicinal products involving biological compounds and small molecules.  WPD has 8 novel drug candidates with 4 that are in clinical development stage and 4 in pre-clinical development.
