So we should no longer tolerate content that doesn’t awaken excitement, evoke passion or inspire debate. But no two students are the same. So content must be personalized to their unique interests without leaving anyone stigmatized or left out of the conversation.”These new products are everything teachers and students already love about Newsela, in addition to subject-specific content, activities, and instructional standards that give ELA, social studies, and science teachers all the content they need to build the background knowledge and critical skills called for in subject area standards.“We’ve delivered content to 90% of U.S. schools that both teachers and students are wildly excited about. With these new products, teachers can always have the perfect text or unit at their fingertips to support the standards they’re covering that day, on a platform they already love using,” said Gross.“The standards are the guides as to what needs to be taught. However, it is a challenge to generate exciting lessons around particular standards. It is important that providers create meaningful content that meet the curricular requirements of the state, as well as authentic and high engagement learning activities,” said Aldo Deodino, Academic Supervisor of Humanities, High Point Regional High School in New Jersey.Newsela ELA, Newsela Social Studies and Newsela ELA are available for immediate purchase.
