(HKG:576) share price up 12% in a single quarter. But over the last half decade, the stock has not performed well. In fact, the share price is down 27%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund. Check out our latest analysis for Zhejiang Expressway While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).While the share price declined over five years, Zhejiang Expressway actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 12% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.Because of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.We note that the dividend has remained healthy, so that wouldn't really explain the share price drop. While it's not completely obvious why the share price is down, a closer look at the company's history might help explain it.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).SEHK:576 Income Statement, January 8th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Zhejiang Expressway's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Zhejiang Expressway's TSR for the last 5 years was -6.7%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveZhejiang Expressway shareholders are up 7.6% for the year (even including dividends) . Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 1.4% endured over half a decade. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around. Before forming an opinion on Zhejiang Expressway you might want to consider the cold hard cash it pays as a dividend.
