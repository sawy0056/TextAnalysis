(BME:ENG)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosIt is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares. The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Enagás, S.A. (BME:ENG).What Is Insider Selling?It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time.

Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (€22.51), we still think insider buying is a positive. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.While Enagás insiders bought shares last year, they didn't sell. They paid about €0.17 on average. To my mind it is good that insiders have invested their own money in the company.
