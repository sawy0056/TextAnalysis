What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital. It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Roche Bobois S.A. (EPA:RBO) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Roche Bobois What Is Roche Bobois's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2019 Roche Bobois had €23.8m of debt, an increase on €20.9, over one year. But on the other hand it also has €24.8m in cash, leading to a €997.0k net cash position.ENXTPA:RBO Historical Debt, January 8th 2020MoreHow Strong Is Roche Bobois's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Roche Bobois had liabilities of €125.0m falling due within a year, and liabilities of €105.6m due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had €24.8m in cash and €31.8m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling €174.0m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.This deficit is considerable relative to its market capitalization of €176.3m, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on Roche Bobois's use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Roche Bobois boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!On top of that, Roche Bobois grew its EBIT by 37% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Roche Bobois can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While Roche Bobois has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Roche Bobois actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.Summing upAlthough Roche Bobois's balance sheet isn't particularly strong, due to the total liabilities, it is clearly positive to see that it has net cash of €997.0k. And it impressed us with free cash flow of €21m, being 113% of its EBIT. So we don't have any problem with Roche Bobois's use of debt.
