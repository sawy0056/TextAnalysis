But now we’ve moved on from how Iran will respond to now anticipating the US 52-pronged response as the US military forces in the region are in a heightened state of alert while likely preparing for war. So, it’s not going to be pretty today. Global Equities are being hit, and the need for defensive strategies is paramount as there is no denying the enormity of long-term geopolitical repercussions of the latest events as oil, bond, and gold defensive strategy flows are providing the lead-in for the local cash market opens.View photosUp until that point, oil markets were becoming a cloudy crystal ball when it came to be gauging middle east risk, but now with the latest escalations, the market is intensifying its responsiveness to supply risk as oil prices rocket higher with risk premia predictably in short supply.View photosHigher oil prices pose significant economic risks to Asia, given its heavy reliance on that region for its oil imports.

So, until this morning’s headline, we had only baked in a $30-35 war premium, so with the Iran retaliation, all but guaranteeing a shock and awe response from the US, gold could be quickly move well into $1600 oz levels.View photosWhile geopolitical risk is clearly here to stay but is probably not fully priced in along the length of the gold forward curve, this suggests we could start to see the forward buys exert more influence on the spot prices as the deterioration in the US -Iran relationship intensifies.This article was written by Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific Market Strategist at AxiTraderThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
