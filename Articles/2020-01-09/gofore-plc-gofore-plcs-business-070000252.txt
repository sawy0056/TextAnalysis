During Christmas and New Year, personnel took the usual vacations, so net sales per working day did not reach that of the peak months.Net sales for the full year were EUR 64.1 million. We were able to continue our long-standing strong growth. This was the 15th consecutive year of profitable growth for the company.Year 2019 was also a time of learning, as customer demand was more difficult to estimate. At the beginning of the year, we expected growth of more than 40% for the financial year. However, in the first half of the year, there were fewer new projects than normal in our public sector clientele. This was to be expected since a similar phenomenon has occurred in the past when a new government was formed in Finland after elections, but the magnitude of this phenomenon surprised us. In addition, during the second quarter, a couple of our major private sector customers reduced their orders. These factors contributed to the year’s growth remaining reasonably good in itself, at 27%.Demand in the public sector normalized in the autumn and sales in the private sector also developed well. In December, we were selected as the primary supplier with the best score for IT Center for Science CSC's framework for information production. We expect the agreement to be worth approximately EUR 1.5-2 million for our part. We confidently look ahead at the start of 2020”.In the Business Reviews, in addition to the month's net sales, the net sales of the corresponding month in the previous year is published. The reviews also include key indicators that further facilitate transparency of the company's growth strategy and comparisons between different periods. Reporting has been supplemented with the Full Time Equivalent (FTE) figure as well as subcontracting FTEs. Additionally, in the monthly Business Reviews for the quarter ending in March and September, the company publishes the Group's EBITA and EBITA-% as well as corresponding figures for the same period in the previous year. The figures are unaudited.
