We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Mensch und Maschine Software SE's (ETR:MUM), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Mensch und Maschine Software has a P/E ratio of 49.67. That means that at current prices, buyers pay €49.67 for every €1 in trailing yearly profits. See our latest analysis for Mensch und Maschine Software How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Mensch und Maschine Software:P/E of 49.67 = €43.60 ÷ €0.88 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each €1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Mensch und Maschine Software Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (40.9) for companies in the software industry is lower than Mensch und Maschine Software's P/E.XTRA:MUM Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Mensch und Maschine Software will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Notably, Mensch und Maschine Software grew EPS by a whopping 30% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 32%. With that performance, I would expect it to have an above average P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Is Debt Impacting Mensch und Maschine Software's P/E?Net debt totals just 1.9% of Mensch und Maschine Software's market cap. The market might award it a higher P/E ratio if it had net cash, but its unlikely this low level of net borrowing is having a big impact on the P/E multiple.The Bottom Line On Mensch und Maschine Software's P/E RatioMensch und Maschine Software has a P/E of 49.7. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 20.9. Its debt levels do not imperil its balance sheet and it is growing EPS strongly. So on this analysis it seems reasonable that its P/E ratio is above average.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
