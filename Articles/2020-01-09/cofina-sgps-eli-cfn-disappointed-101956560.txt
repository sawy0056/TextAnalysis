But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Cofina, SGPS, S.A. (ELI:CFN) share price is up 57% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around -3.4% (not including dividends). See our latest analysis for Cofina SGPS There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Cofina SGPS was able to grow its EPS at 8.0% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 16% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).ENXTLS:CFN Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Cofina SGPS's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered Cofina SGPS's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Dividends have been really beneficial for Cofina SGPS shareholders, and that cash payout contributed to why its TSR of 57%, over the last 3 years, is better than the share price return.A Different PerspectiveCofina SGPS shareholders are down 31% for the year, but the market itself is up 18%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.1% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
