A looming recession isn’t great news for buyers, especially with the average family unable to afford a home in many parts of the country as it is. Prospective homebuyers are also concerned about their ability to make mortgage payments, with 8.2% of homeowners currently underwater on their mortgage. But with all of these economic anxieties, how will you know when it’s a good time to make a move? If you’re debating on whether to buy or sell a home, the best financial choice will depend on the home value forecast in your state.According to the latest home value forecast data from Zillow, the median home value in the U.S. is $243,225. Home values have gone up 3.8% over the past year, with Zillow predicting an increase of 2.2% within the next year. Many housing analysts predict that home prices will continue to rise — however, at a slower pace.To figure out the value of homes in 2020 across the country, GOBankingRates analyzed median home values from October 2019 using Zillow’s forecast tool to predict the increase or decrease in home values by state. The study ranked each state according to its median home value, beginning with the lowest.It is important to note that GOBankingRates used the median home value instead of the median home price by state because value accounts for more factors, such as comparable home sales and inspections. Median home value is an estimate of what the property is actually worth, while the median list price is based on demand and listing agent.Some home values are set to increase dramatically in just one year, with an anticipated increase of at least $15,000 in states like Idaho, Alaska, Utah and Washington. Other state housing markets, such as West Virginia, Louisiana and Connecticut, will not see much of a difference in home value in 2020.

The main factors were: (1) the forecasted percentage increase for one year, (2) the amount the home value is expected to increase by and (3) what the home value will be in October 2020.GOBankingRates used the median home value instead of median listing price because it takes more factors into account, such as comparable home sales and inspections. Median home value is an estimate of what the property is actually worth, while median listing price may be lower or higher than the home value, depending on the price that the listing agent chooses to list the property at and depending on how high the demand is for that given home. All research was conducted on Dec. 18, 2019.*Home valuation is Zillow’s estimated market value, computed using a proprietary formula. It is not an appraisal. It is a starting point in determining a home’s value. The Zestimate is calculated from public and user-submitted data, taking into account special features, location and market conditions. To find home values, proprietary automated valuation models apply advanced algorithms to analyze the data to identify relationships within a specific geographic area, between this home-related data and actual sales prices. Home characteristics, such as square footage, location or the number of bathrooms, are given different weights according to their influence on home sale prices in each specific geography over a specific period of time, resulting in a set of valuation rules, or models, that are applied to generate each home’s value. This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: What Homes Will Be Worth in Your State by the End of 2020ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNew Strong Buy Stocks for February 27thZacksMortgage Rates Low 3% To End February 2020.
