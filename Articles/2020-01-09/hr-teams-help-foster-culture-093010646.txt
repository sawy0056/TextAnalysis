Within the workplace, good company culture requires buy-in from all employees, from entry-level members of staff right the way up to the C-suite.In an exclusive article for European CEO magazine, Karl-Heinz Oehler, Partner and Managing Director of Denison Consulting Europe, explained that there is now plenty of evidence to suggest that a healthy corporate culture delivers improved financial results. Good performance cannot be sustained by individuals or siloed teams, it comes from the way in which different company functions interact with one another.“Almost all CEOs and management teams recognise the importance of building a high-performing culture that is appropriate for their industry,” Oehler wrote. “They know that employees deliver excellent results if they understand the meaning and purpose of their role and the work they perform. Leadership is not just about building a profitable business – it is equally about building meaning and purpose for employees.”A good human resources (HR) team is essential for businesses looking to cultivate a culture that gets the most from their human talent. HR should be viewed as an investment rather than a cost because of the way it can support staff retention, improve accountability and boost communication. When businesses recognise the value creation that HR teams can have, they become powerful allies in the search for a culture that’s the right fit for your industry, market and employees.To find out more about Denison Consulting and how its solutions can help your company create powerful cultural change, check out an exclusive article in the latest issue of European CEO, available in print, online and on tablet now.www.europeanceo.comWorld News Media is a leading publisher of quality financial and business magazines, enjoying a global distribution network that includes subscriber lists of prominent and senior decision-makers around the world.CONTACT INFORMATIONWorld News Media Barclay Ballard Editorial Department +44 (0)20 7553 4177 barclay.ballard@wnmedia.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSAG-AFTRA Rallies For First Contract With Spanish Broadcasting SystemDeadlineBeijing’s city government issued 10 anti-coronavirus rules for workplacesQuartzJames Currier, Sarah Nahm, Arun Mathew and Vlad Magdalin to speak at Early Stage SFTechCrunchOne million Britons will be on zero-hour contracts by end of 2020The ConversationBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
