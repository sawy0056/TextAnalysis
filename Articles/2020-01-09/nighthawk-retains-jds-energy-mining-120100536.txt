(CNW Group/Nighthawk Gold Corp.)MoreTORONTO , Jan. 8, 2020 /CNW/ - Nighthawk Gold Corp. ("Nighthawk" or the "Company") (TSX: NHK; OTCQX: MIMZF) is pleased to announce it has retained leading engineering firm, JDS Energy & Mining Inc. ("JDS"), to complete an initial internal, high-level scoping study (not prepared in compliance with NI 43-101, the "Study"), that will examine the economic potential of the Colomac Gold Project ("Colomac"). As previously announced, a mineral resource estimate is being completed which the Company anticipates will be ready within the first half of the year and which is expected to include a mineral resource update for Colomac and a maiden mineral resource estimate for the Damoti Lake Gold deposit. The updated resource estimate for Colomac will serve as the basis for the Study which will examine both open pit and underground mining potential. As well, the Company is moving forward with its proposed consolidation (the "Share Consolidation") of its share capital on the basis of five (5) existing common shares for one (1) new common share.Dr. Michael Byron , President and CEO commented, "With previous shareholder support for the Share Consolidation, the timing is right to enact the rollback which we believe will allow Nighthawk to gain exposure to a broader shareholder base. With our continued efforts, we strongly believe that the Indin Lake Gold Property has the endowments to become one of Canada's premier gold camps, which already has a robust project with a multi-million-ounce inferred mineral resource at its centre. To that end, we are engaging JDS to initiate engineering studies to examine the potential development and mining opportunities at Colomac. We look forward embarking on this important step forward in advancing Colomac." Jeff Stibbard , Chief Executive Officer of JDS commented, "We are happy to be working with the Nighthawk team and delivering on our commitment to help work toward their initial engineering studies to begin to consider the viability of Colomac. Nighthawk has completed enough base work to embark on the engineering path, and we are pleased to have been selected to work with them given our extensive operational and permitting experience on a number of cold weather heap leach and Northwest Territories mining projects such as Eagle Gold, Coffee, Hope Bay and Gahucho Kue to name a few."Internal Scoping StudyJDS is a renowned engineering firm with a powerful and experienced team of seasoned professionals. JDS has successfully designed, constructed and operated similar projects in the region. They have taken many stranded or un-optimized assets and engineered them to a positive result by focusing on the economics to ensure projects are scoped correctly. They also acquire, design, permit, finance, build and operate their own projects, making them well known to the investment community and better equipped to understand the needs of their clients.Share ConsolidationCurrently, a total of 223,360,996 common shares in the capital of the Company are issued and outstanding. Accordingly, if put into effect on the basis of five (5) existing common shares for one (1) new common share, a total of approximately 44,672,199 common shares in the capital of the Company would be issued and outstanding following the Share Consolidation, assuming no other change in the issued capital. The Share Consolidation is anticipated to become effective on or about January 13, 2020 .The Share Consolidation will affect all of the Company's stock options, and share units issued and outstanding at the effective date. At the time of the Share Consolidation, the number, exchange basis or exercise price of all stock options and share units will be adjusted, as applicable, to reflect the one-for-five Share Consolidation. The actual adjustment will be made by the Company in consultation with its advisors.The Share Consolidation was previously approved by shareholders at a meeting held on June 3, 2019 and has been conditionally approved by the Toronto Stock Exchange. Please refer to the management information circular of the Company dated April 30, 2019 , for additional details on the Share Consolidation.
