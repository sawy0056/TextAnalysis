From Cairns, experience "Rooster Tail," "Cheese Churn" and "Hells Gate" on the Barron River in Queensland on a wild rapids ride. It's an adrenaline rush as you swoosh through gorges and past stunning waterfalls and lush rainforest.Guests enjoying a P&O Cruises Australia vacation to the South Pacific island of Vanuatu can test their adventurous streak on a zipline suspended in the treetops at Summit Hill, with the valley floor some 262 feet below.In Alaska, an adventure experience is a must-do, with a myriad of options such as flightseeing, mountain biking, kayaking, ATV riding, ziplining and fishing tours to catch salmon or halibut.

You might follow a pod of whales, while admiring eagles overhead. In addition to Alaska, the Ventures program is available in such places as Antarctica, Norway and the Amazon.Princess Cruises, with its partnership with Discovery™ and Animal Planet, has adventures such as whale watching or visiting a dog sled camp, with special activities that would appeal to kids ages 3 to 12. For grownups and kids age 12 and up, a once-in-a-lifetime Discovery-recommended Helicopter Glacier Trek has you landing on a glacier in the Juneau Icefield and putting on crampons to go trekking on the blue ice.Holland America Line has such extraordinary shore experiences as hele-hiking, rock climbing and riding on the historic White Pass & Yukon Route Railroad for a snowshoe adventure in the snowy upper reaches of the Tormented Valley in northern British Columbia. These are the sorts of excursions that will have you breathing deeply and thinking, "Wow, it's good to be alive."Recommendation: Make sure you read any fitness requirements, age and weight requirements before booking an adventure excursion.
