But in the last couple months, McClinchey – a vegetarian – has been twice to eat the P.L.T."I liked it. It hit that nostalgic factor," McClinchey told Reuters while shopping at a comic store in London, Ontario, last month.A report from the Canadian newspaper Financial Post, citing a McDonald's executive, said the test would help the company determine who is buying the sandwich, but that so far the P.L.T. had the right name and recipe. (https://bit.ly/2T2QQG5)McDonald's confirmed to Reuters that demand for the item was higher in urban areas, and one franchisee with more rural locations opted out of the second phase of the test.Southwestern Ontario, particularly the city of London and surrounding areas, has long been the "guinea pig of Canada" to test new products, said Gerry McCartney, CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce.The area, about two hours southwest of Toronto, has the perfect demographic mix as a diverse but hard-to-win market, according to locals and experts interviewed by Reuters.Traditionally a farming community surrounded by conservative agricultural and industrial areas, it is close to the United States and has an urban core with more liberal pockets.It has a big university, as well as a number of residents from Europe and other countries, and even boasts Canada's first 24-hour vegan fast food drive-thru restaurant, called Globally Local.UBS said in December that McDonald's could sell more than 250 million P.L.T. sandwiches annually if it rolled out the product across its nearly 14,000 U.S. outlets, based on the Swiss investment bank's tests that showed McDonald's was selling nearly 100 burgers a day at some outlets.(Reporting by Praveen Paramasivam in Bengaluru and Hilary Russ in New York; Editing by Maju Samuel and Nick Zieminski)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextProtests show Canadian, indigenous laws need reconcilingAFPCanada to no longer pay for Harry and Meghan securityAFPBank of Canada to stay put for now, but 2020 rate cut in play: Reuters pollReutersCanada's Going to Stop Paying for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Security CostsCosmopolitanMagna CEO: Anti-pipeline blockades are 'insane' and risk Canada's prosperityYahoo Finance CanadaBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
