Most of the historical mines are developed in quartz veins and veinlets hosted in a granoblastic granite showing argillic alteration within a sheared fringe; mapping has identified parallel structures on historical mines in sheared granite with quartz veinlets, oxides, and boxworks of the original sulphides (pyrite, galena, etc.).  Immediately north of Santa Lucia is the Las Palomas area, where historical mines were developed on six parallel structures in granoblastic granite, dipping 45 – 50 degrees, 150-degree azimuth, sub-parallel to the Santa Lucia trend.  Historical mines tend to be of low angle at depth with high angle fracturing of gray quartz cutting the main structures and foliation in the granite. The best gold values at Las Palomas site are 26.40 g/t Au producing adjacent samples of 14.60 g/t Au, 5.54 g/t Au, 7.30 g/t Au.  These samples are strongly oxidized with stockwork veining containing boxworks from sulfides and strong hematite alteration.Table 1: Assay Results of Chip Rock Samples on Santa Lucia-Las Palomas Targets Above 0.50 g/t Au AREA TYPE OF SAMPLE LENGTH Au g/t Ag g/t Pb PPM Zn PPM Cu PPM

Initial assays have been in the 1.3 to 3 g/t range.  Located in the south-central portion of the property, it is an area with gold mineralization that extends in the direction of E-W, being the most notable evidence a series of historical mines occurring in a line of about 100-120 meters, the most important of which is La Cueva del Leon adit, developed along a vein of quartz and stockwork of quartz-hematite in a gneiss sequence.  The mineralized area in its projection to the west is lost in the valley under the alluvial cover, towards Represo Seco as described above. It is necessary to extend the exploration in both directions of Cueva del Leon, perpendicular to the general dip of the known structure, to know its relationship with others exposed to the north and south.Table 4:Assay Results of Chip Rock Samples on Cueva del León Area Above 0.50 g/t Au.              AREA TYPE OF SAMPLE LENGTH Au g/t Ag g/t Pb PPM Zn PPM Cu PPM

Of the deposits within the Caborca Orogenic Gold Belt are a number of large open pit heap leach gold operations such as La Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Nochebuena (Fresnillo PLC), San Francisco mine (Alio Gold Inc), Cerro Colorado (GoldGroup Mining Inc.), El Chanate (Alamos Gold Inc) and La Choya (Hecla Mining). Historic estimates of the combined gold reserves and resources identified within the trend to date total in excess of 10 million ounces   of gold (Izaguirre et al., 2017), which is based on prior data and reports obtained and prepared by previous operators.The oldest rocks within the property are a package of metamorphic rocks which include banded quartz-feldspathic gneiss and augen gneiss, granite, and green schist. All metamorphic rocks exhibit foliation which generally varies in strike direction from between 330-degrees to North and dips to the southwest generally at 45-degrees at Santa Lucia and Cueva de Lion. The strike direction at San Martin is generally North/South with sub vertical dips.  Quartz veins generally follow foliation and strike of the metamorphic rocks.Story continuesThe metamorphic rocks are intruded by a Tertiary igneous package, which includes granite with visible feldspar and quartz, and is porphyritic in texture. It appears that the granite was emplaced along low angle shear zones in the system.QA/QC ProgramQuality Assurance/Quality Control consists of the regular insertion of duplicates, blanks and certified reference standards into the sample stream. Check samples will be submitted to an umpire laboratory at the end of the drilling program.  Samples are kept in a secure facility and transferred to Bureau Veritas in Hermosillo, Mexico in sealed containers on a weekly basis from the drill site by Company personnel. Personnel handling samples are using Corporation-approved protocols for all phases of chip logging, sample delineation, sample layout, and storage.  Bureau Veritas is ISO 9001 certified.  Bureau Veritas has a standard operating procedure (“SOP”) for all aspects of sample drop off, drying and preparation, digestion, instrument analysis, quality control assurance and computerized data reporting.Qualified PersonJames Baughman, (P.Geo.)
