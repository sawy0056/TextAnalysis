Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Headlam Group:0.14 = UK£42m ÷ (UK£533m - UK£227m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Headlam Group has an ROCE of 14%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Headlam Group.How Headlam Group's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCEShort term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Headlam Group has total assets of UK£533m and current liabilities of UK£227m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 43% of its total assets. Headlam Group has a middling amount of current liabilities, increasing its ROCE somewhat.Our Take On Headlam Group's ROCEWhile its ROCE looks good, it's worth remembering that the current liabilities are making the business look better.
