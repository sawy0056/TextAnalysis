To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Instem:0.11 = UK£2.4m ÷ (UK£34m - UK£13m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, Instem has an ROCE of 11%.
See our latest analysis for Instem Is Instem's ROCE Good?One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies. We can see Instem's ROCE is meaningfully below the Healthcare Services industry average of 16%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Instem.How Instem's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCELiabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Instem has total liabilities of UK£13m and total assets of UK£34m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 37% of its total assets. Instem has a medium level of current liabilities, which would boost the ROCE.Our Take On Instem's ROCEWhile its ROCE looks good, it's worth remembering that the current liabilities are making the business look better.
