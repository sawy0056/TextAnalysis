Last month, Samsung's U.S. chip rival Micron Technology Inc forecast the industry to recover in 2020."The DRAM chip price has already hit bottom while inventories have been holding at lower levels - a potentially encouraging sign to pull up DRAM prices in the second quarter," said analyst Park Sung-soon at Cape Investment & Securities.Samsung said it expected to report later this month a 34% drop in operating profit at 7.1 trillion won ($6.04 billion) for its fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 versus the same period a year earlier.That would beat the forecast 6.5 trillion won operating profit from Refinitiv SmartEstimate, helped by one-off gains, analysts said.Its revenue declined 0.5% to 59 trillion won, missing the 60.7 trillion won forecast from Refinitiv SmartEstimate.Annual operating profit likely fell 53% to 27.7 trillion won, the lowest since 2015 and steepest decline in a decade.MOBILE BOOSTEarnings from chips and mobile devices in the fourth quarter were better than analysts expected, whereas the display business lagged, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, declining to be identified as the information was not public."Samsung's Q4 mobile shipments rose from last year as sales in LATAM, South Asia and Europe were more robust," said analyst Tom Kang at market researcher Counterpoint. "This was partially from Huawei's overseas losses and Samsung's new A series," he said, referring to Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd which is tackling restricted access to U.S. suppliers.Premium smartphone sales also boosted earnings, Kang said.Samsung is expected to announce a new version of its flagship Galaxy S smartphone and a foldable handset on Feb. 11.In displays, Samsung - an Apple Inc supplier - shut a liquid-crystal display production line in September, hit by falling prices and slower demand for television sets and smartphones coupled with rising competition from Chinese rivals. Samsung plans to convert the line for more advanced displays.(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christopher Cushing)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSamsung is already working to fix the Galaxy S20 camerasEngadgetLG announces third smartphone with attachable second screen, the V60 ThinQ 5GAFP Relax NewsMicron (MU) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should KnowZacksDigital period and fertility tracking: how reliable are the predictions?AFP Relax NewsVerizon Hits 4.2 Gbps Network Speed With Carrier AggregationZacksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
