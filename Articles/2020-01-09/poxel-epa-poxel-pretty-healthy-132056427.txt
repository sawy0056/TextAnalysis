So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Poxel SA (EPA:POXEL) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Poxel What Is Poxel's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2019 Poxel had debt of €8.73m, up from €0.7 in one year. However, it does have €49.8m in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of €41.0m.ENXTPA:POXEL Historical Debt, January 8th 2020MoreA Look At Poxel's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Poxel had liabilities of €38.4m falling due within a year, and liabilities of €1.89m due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of €49.8m and €19.1m worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has €28.6m more liquid assets than total liabilities.This short term liquidity is a sign that Poxel could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Simply put, the fact that Poxel has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.It was also good to see that despite losing money on the EBIT line last year, Poxel turned things around in the last 12 months, delivering and EBIT of €268k. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Poxel's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While Poxel has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last year, Poxel saw substantial negative free cash flow, in total. While investors are no doubt expecting a reversal of that situation in due course, it clearly does mean its use of debt is more risky.Summing upWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Poxel has net cash of €41.0m, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities.
