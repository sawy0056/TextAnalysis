See our latest analysis for China Haida How Does Youcai Xu's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, China Haida Ltd. has a market capitalization of S$2.8m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth CN¥239k over the year to December 2018. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at CN¥84k. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. We examined a group of similar sized companies, with market capitalizations of below S$270m. The median CEO total compensation in that group is S$468k.Most shareholders would consider it a positive that Youcai Xu takes less total compensation than the CEOs of most similar size companies, leaving more for shareholders. Though positive, it's important we delve into the performance of the actual business.You can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at China Haida, below.SGX:C92 CEO Compensation, January 8th 2020MoreIs China Haida Ltd.

It saw its revenue drop 4.5% over the last year.Sadly for shareholders, earnings per share are actually down, over three years. And the fact that revenue is down year on year arguably paints an ugly picture. So given this relatively weak performance, shareholders would probably not want to see high compensation for the CEO.
