The US National Defence Authorisation Act for the 2020 financial year, which US President Donald Trump signed into law last month, would prevent federal funds from being used to purchase passenger railcars or buses from any state-owned or state-controlled enterprises, including those from China.The emphasis on the role of the party in state-owned enterprises also is at odds with Beijing's earlier vision of forging a modern corporate governance system at state firms that centred on the board of directors.Sign up now for our 50% early bird offer from SCMP Research: China AI Report.
