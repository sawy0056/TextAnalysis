I'm so grateful that the Chivas Venture is giving me this opportunity to represent Scotland and bring my vision to life!" – Dr Lorenzo Conti.Dr Lorenzo Conti, founder of Crover, will now embark on the journey of a lifetime that will put his business to the test on a global scale.

Two centuries later, the Chivas Venture champions these values – to date, the competition has positively impacted over 2 million lives, thanks to the $5m that Chivas has awarded to social businesses around the world.Just as Chivas champions the perfect blend of malt and grain whiskies in its Scotch, the Chivas Venture champions entrepreneurs who blend profit and purpose to have a positive impact on the world.
