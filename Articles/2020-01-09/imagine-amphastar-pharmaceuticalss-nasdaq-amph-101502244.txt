But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMPH) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 54% over five years, which is below the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 14% in that time. Check out our latest analysis for Amphastar Pharmaceuticals There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the five years of share price growth, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals moved from a loss to profitability. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the Amphastar Pharmaceuticals share price has gained 6.8% in three years. During the same period, EPS grew by 34% each year. This EPS growth is higher than the 2.2% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. So you might conclude the market is a little more cautious about the stock, these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NasdaqGS:AMPH Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how Amphastar Pharmaceuticals has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.

However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9.0% per year over half a decade.
