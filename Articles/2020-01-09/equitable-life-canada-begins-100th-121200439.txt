Founder Sydney Tweed used a rented typewriter and purchased $150 worth of furniture for the space that he shared with a clerk.Over the last 100 years, through significant historic and financial challenges – two World Wars, the Great Depression, economic crises in the 80s and 90s, regulatory challenges and significant growth and expansion in the face of stiff industry competition – Equitable Life of Canada has become one of Canada's largest and most financially stable mutual companies. With more than 750 employees and a network of 10,000 independent producers across Canada , our head office is still in Waterloo – just 1.5 kilometres from where we started."For 100 years, we've been protecting what matters most to Canadians," said Ron Beettam , who joined Equitable Life in 2005 as President and Chief Executive Officer. "We're proud of our past and all the accomplishments that have brought us here today, and we're excited by the future as we begin the next century for Equitable Life of Canada ."A special 100th Anniversary website, www.equitable100.ca, was launched today to highlight the company's historic milestones and share information throughout the year about the anniversary-related activities planned for 2020, including:The Equitable Gives Back Contest that will award five charitable organizations in Canada a grant of $10,000 based on their winning entries; The
