Repeating the same test, however, could cost millions of dollars. For now, NASA will try to determine if they have enough data to control the system’s overall performance, including launch, on-orbit operations navigation, and docking. “Although data from the uncrewed test is important for certification, it may not be the only way that Boeing is able to demonstrate its system’s full capabilities,” said the agency.Price ActionShare of Boeing rose 1.06% to close at $337.28 on Tuesday.Price Action: Courtesy of NASA and Boeing via Wikimedia0See more from BenzingaAsian Business Leaders Believe Trump Will Be Re-elected, US-China Relations Can Deteriorate: Survey'Apprentice' Contestant's Defamation Case Against Trump Will Be Tried In New York Court of AppealsTopGolf Could Be Valued At B In IPO, Bloomberg Reports© 2020 Benzinga.com.
