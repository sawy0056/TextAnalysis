Investigo did not respond to an emailed request for comment.A spokesman for Zurich's local cantonal police declined to comment on the complaints, which were first reported by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger earlier on Wednesday.(Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextVikings' Katheryn Winnick to Lead David E.
