Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.Some readers mightn't know much about MIPS's 1.3% dividend, as it has only been paying distributions for a year or so. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying MIPS for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis OM:MIPS Historical Dividend Yield, January 7th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 83% of MIPS's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. Paying out a majority of its earnings limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate a commitment to paying a dividend, or a dearth of investment opportunities.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. MIPS paid out 331% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. Paying out such a high percentage of cash flow suggests that the dividend was funded from either cash at bank or by borrowing, neither of which is desirable over the long term. While MIPS's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, free cash flow is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to MIPS's ability to maintain its dividend.With a strong net cash balance, MIPS investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.We update our data on MIPS every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. With a payment history of less than 2 years, we think it's a bit too soon to think about living on the income from its dividend. Its most recent annual dividend was kr2.50 per share.It's good to see at least some dividend growth. Yet with a relatively short dividend paying history, we wouldn't want to depend on this dividend too heavily.Dividend Growth PotentialExamining whether the dividend is affordable and stable is important. However, it's also important to assess if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Over the long term, dividends need to grow at or above the rate of inflation, in order to maintain the recipient's purchasing power. It's good to see MIPS has been growing its earnings per share at 50% a year over the past five years. MIPS earnings have been growing very quickly recently, but given that it is paying out more than half of its earnings, we wonder if it will have enough capital to fund further growth in the future.Story continuesConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that MIPS's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we think MIPS has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, although its dividend history is not as long as we'd like. In sum, we find it hard to get excited about MIPS from a dividend perspective. It's not that we think it's a bad business; just that there are other companies that perform better on these criteria.Now, if you want to look closer, it would be worth checking out our free research on MIPS management tenure, salary, and performance.Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
