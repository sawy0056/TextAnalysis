SEHK:2182 Historical Dividend Yield, January 8th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 20% of Tian Chang Group Holdings's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. With a low payout ratio, it looks like the dividend is comprehensively covered by earnings.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Tian Chang Group Holdings's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.We update our data on Tian Chang Group Holdings every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. With a payment history of less than 2 years, we think it's a bit too soon to think about living on the income from its dividend. Its most recent annual dividend was HK$0.03 per share.We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.Dividend Growth PotentialThe other half of the dividend investing equation is evaluating whether earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Growing EPS can help maintain or increase the purchasing power of the dividend over the long run. It's good to see Tian Chang Group Holdings has been growing its earnings per share at 14% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share are growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low. We think this is an ideal combination in a dividend stock.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Firstly, we like that Tian Chang Group Holdings has a low and conservative payout ratio. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, although its dividend history is not as long as we'd like. Tian Chang Group Holdings fits all of our criteria, and we think there are a lot of positives to it from a dividend perspective.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Tian Chang Group Holdings stock.
