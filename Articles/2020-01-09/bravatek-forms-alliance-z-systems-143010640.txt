(OTC Pink: BVTK) (“Bravatek” or the “Company”) announced that it entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Z Systems, with headquarters in northern New Jersey.  The agreement was entered into following BVTK’s agreement with ZoonoUSA, a manufacturer and supplier of advanced technology products that offer germ protection, long after the product is applied, by creating a protective shield on the surface it is applied to. This shield lasts about 30 days on surfaces and 24 hours on skin, when natural exfoliation occurs.Z Systems’ capabilities were created to meet the current needs of industry with regards to protecting employees, and the public in general, against unseen organisms. To meet those needs, Z Systems offers a comprehensive protection plan which includes the application of a chlorine-based disinfectant in conjunction with Zoono’s proprietary and protective barrier product. The Zoono product contains a molecule, which when dried and hardened, creates a surface of “pins” or needle-like projections that pierce and destroy harmful organisms for approximately 30 days. By re-applying this barrier just 12 times per year, a strong defense is put into place that protects you, your staff and your clientele around the clock –not just when disinfectant is applied. About Z SystemsEmploying what the World Health Organization (WHO) calls the nearly “Perfect Disinfectant”, with a proprietary antimicrobial coating, Z Systems provides clinically tested protection for people and their facilities to avoid devastating cross-contamination in the workplace.For more information, visit https://zsystems.solutions.About Bravatek Solutions, Inc.Bravatek Solutions, Inc. is a high technology security solutions portfolio provider that assists corporate entities, governments and individuals protect their organizations against both physical and cyber-attacks through its offering of the most technically advanced, cost-effective and reliable software, tools and systems.For more information, visit https://bravatek.com.Safe Harbor StatementThis news release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended to be covered by the “safe harbor” created by those sections.
