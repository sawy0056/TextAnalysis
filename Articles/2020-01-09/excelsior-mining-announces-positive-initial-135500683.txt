(TSX: MIN) (FSE: 3XS) (OTCQX: EXMGF) ("Excelsior" or the "Company") is pleased to provide an update on operations at the Gunnison Copper Project in southern Arizona.Initial copper recovery grades are exceeding feasibility study expectations. Pregnant leach solution (PLS) grade is currently measuring 0.15 grams per liter (gpl) copper in the primary recovery pond; this milestone is ahead of schedule and keeps Excelsior on pace for copper production this quarter."We have the newest, most orderly, and technologically advanced in-situ recovery wellfield on the planet, and to date, it is functioning better than anticipated, stated Stephen Twyerould, President and CEO. "We look forward to updating the market on our progress as we complete the transition to producer status."Acid injection is being steadily increased and is currently at approximately 50% of the full production rate. The 41 injection and recovery wells that comprise the production wellfield will continue to circulate mining solutions (over a cubic area of approximately 400ft x 400ft x 700ft) in a closed-loop system until the concentration of copper held in solution warrants processing. Once this grade is achieved, mining solutions will then be treated through the Johnson Camp processing facilities to extract copper and produce LME grade copper cathode sheets. First copper cathode sales are expected in Q1, 2020.About Excelsior MiningExcelsior "The Copper Solution Company" is a mineral exploration and production company that owns the Gunnison Copper Project in Cochise County, Arizona. The project is a low cost, environmentally friendly in-situ recovery copper extraction project that is permitted to 125 million pounds per year of copper cathode production. The Feasibility Study projected an after-tax NPV of US$ 807 million and an IRR of 40% using a US$ 2.75 per pound copper price and a 7.5% discount rate.Excelsior's technical work on the Gunnison Copper Project is supervised by Stephen Twyerould, Fellow of AUSIMM, President & CEO of Excelsior and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.
