See our latest analysis for China Sunshine Paper Holdings In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, China Sunshine Paper Holdings managed to grow its earnings per share at 85% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 3.72.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:2002 Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for China Sunshine Paper Holdings the TSR over the last 5 years was 156%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that China Sunshine Paper Holdings has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 16% in the last twelve months.
