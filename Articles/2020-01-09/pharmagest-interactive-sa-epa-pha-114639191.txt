On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.While Pharmagest Interactive's 1.4% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Pharmagest Interactive for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Pharmagest Interactive! ENXTPA:PHA Historical Dividend Yield, January 8th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Pharmagest Interactive paid out 48% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Pharmagest Interactive paid out 60% of its cash flow as dividends last year, which is within a reasonable range for the average corporation. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Pharmagest Interactive's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Pharmagest Interactive's latest financial position,

For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Pharmagest Interactive's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €0.27 in 2010, compared to €0.85 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 12% per year over this time.Dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. It's good to see Pharmagest Interactive has been growing its earnings per share at 11% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a good rate, and the company is paying less than half its earnings as dividends. We generally think this is an attractive combination, as it permits further reinvestment in the business.Story continuesConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Above all, we're glad to see that Pharmagest Interactive pays out a low fraction of its earnings and, while it paid a higher percentage of cashflow, this also was within a normal range. That said, we were glad to see it growing earnings and paying a fairly consistent dividend. All things considered, Pharmagest Interactive looks like a strong prospect. At the right valuation, it could be something special.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Pharmagest Interactive stock.
