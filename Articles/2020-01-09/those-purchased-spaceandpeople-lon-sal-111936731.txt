But unfortunately, some companies simply don't succeed. Zooming in on an example, the SpaceandPeople plc (LON:SAL) share price dropped 74% in the last half decade. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. And it's not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 31% in the last year. See our latest analysis for SpaceandPeople In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.In the last half decade SpaceandPeople saw its share price fall as its EPS declined below zero. At present it's hard to make valid comparisons between EPS and the share price. But we would generally expect a lower price, given the situation.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).AIM:SAL Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on SpaceandPeople's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, SpaceandPeople's TSR for the last 5 years was -69%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveSpaceandPeople shareholders are down 29% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 19%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 21% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
