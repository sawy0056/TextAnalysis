Macy’s is a $5 billion market cap company and an anchor store in some of America’s top malls.While this may not seem like great place to be, investors appear to have overdone it to the downside and in that is where the opportunity emerges. The stock passes three of our strategies with at least a 90% score and three more with a 70% score.For example, the stock ranks in the 1st percentile using our Value Composite model based on James O’Shaughnessy’s value composite method, an approach that uses multiple value metrics and then ranks all stocks based on the composite score. That’s just one of many models that rank the stock highly.In addition, the stock trades around $17/share, far below it’s 52-week high of $32. The company pays a nice dividend as well. You can buy this, get paid, and any slight improvement in the business should lead to healthy returns for Macy’s in 2020.More From MoneyShow.com:Top Picks 2020: Alphabet (GOOGL)Top Picks 2020: Americold Realty Trust (COLD)Top Picks 2020: Signet Jewelers (SIG)Top Picks 2020: Boeing Company (BA)Top Picks 2020: Best Buy (BBY)Top Picks 2020: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIs Sun Life (SLF) Stock Undervalued Right Now?ZacksAre Investors Undervaluing Cardtronics (CATM) Right Now?ZacksIs Euronav NV (EURN) a Great Value Stock Right Now?ZacksIs Macy's (M) Stock Undervalued Right Now?ZacksIs Dynex Capital (DX) Stock Undervalued Right Now?ZacksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
