For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed.So should Seeing Machines (LON:SEE) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. See our latest analysis for Seeing Machines Does Seeing Machines Have A Long Cash Runway?A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. As at June 2019, Seeing Machines had cash of AU$64m and such minimal debt that we can ignore it for the purposes of this analysis. In the last year, its cash burn was AU$35m. So it had a cash runway of approximately 22 months from June 2019. That's not too bad, but it's fair to say the end of the cash runway is in sight, unless cash burn reduces drastically. We should note, however, that if we extrapolate recent trends in its cash burn, then its cash runway would get a lot longer. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.AIM:SEE Historical Debt, January 8th 2020MoreHow Well Is Seeing Machines Growing?Seeing Machines reduced its cash burn by 16% during the last year, which points to some degree of discipline. And operating revenue was up by 3.8%, too. Considering the factors above, the company doesn’t fare badly when it comes to assessing how it is changing over time. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years.Can Seeing Machines Raise More Cash Easily?Seeing Machines seems to be in a fairly good position, in terms of cash burn, but we still think it's worthwhile considering how easily it could raise more money if it wanted to. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash to fund growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.Seeing Machines's cash burn of AU$35m is about 11% of its AU$322m market capitalisation. As a result, we'd venture that the company could raise more cash for growth without much trouble, albeit at the cost of some dilution.How Risky Is Seeing Machines's Cash Burn Situation?The good news is that in our view Seeing Machines's cash burn situation gives shareholders real reason for optimism. One the one hand we have its solid cash runway, while on the other it can also boast very strong cash burn relative to its market cap. Cash burning companies are always on the riskier side of things, but after considering all of the factors discussed in this short piece, we're not too worried about its rate of cash burn.
