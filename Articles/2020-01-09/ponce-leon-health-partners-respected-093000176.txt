It has also shown the ability to decrease 31 internal and external signs of aging in the study: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/779157v1.(PRNewsfoto/Ponce De Leon Health)MoreDr. Rita Rakus is a highly experienced practitioner in the field of Cosmetic Medicine. Since qualifying as a medical practitioner at Sydney University in Australia in 1974, Dr. Rakus has subsequently developed an expertise in all aspects of non-surgical facial rejuvenation, facial line reduction, and lip enhancements. She is one of the founders of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine and serves as a member and fellow.  In addition to her own clinical work, she trains, lectures, and sets standards for practicing doctors within the field of Cosmetic Medicine.  In recognition of her work, the Royal Society of Medicine added her name to the Wall of Honour."I'm excited to be partnering with Ponce De Leon Health and carrying Rejuvant LifeTabs in my clinic. My patients are not only looking younger on the outside but are also feeling ageless on the inside. This ups the ante of what science can do to benefit a wellness industry that's focused on developing products and practices that help resist aging," said Dr. Rakus.  She continued, "I always want to provide my patients with 'what's next,' and Rejuvant is setting the bar for the future of products that are beneficial for both beauty and health. The Rejuvant high scientific standard will ultimately help customers throughout their aging process."This distribution agreement begins the first of many business expansions Ponce De Leon Health plans to make for the Rejuvant brand. Rejuvant LifeTabs was developed in collaboration with Dr. Brian Kennedy, who supervised the research at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. The goal was to discover safe, non-drug compounds that can lead to a healthier and longer lifespan.  Rejuvant LifeTabs consists of the scientifically formulated LifeAKG™, sustained-release Calcium Alpha-Ketoglutarate. LifeAKG works as the active ingredient in the dietary supplement and has demonstrated the capability to slow and reverse epigenetic or biological aging, restoring the DNA methylation profile to that of a younger person. For the first time ever, the company is offering third party DNA testing of biological age, to establish a baseline and track Rejuvant's progress."Through science and innovation, we are able to show that longevity is more than just skin deep. By using LifeAKG, we have found that we can pause DNA methylation and reverse biological aging," said Ponce De Leon Health Founder and CEO, Tom Weldon. "Our researchers were able to demonstrate an ability to modulate both known and newly discovered pathways associated with aging, including detoxification against age-related ammonia buildup in the brain, kidney, and liver; maintenance of DNA integrity, supporting the regulation of cellular energy, and blocking inflammation and oxidative stress caused by aging cells. This partnership with Dr. Rakus is just one more step to growing the Rejuvant brand and our business, to ultimately aid in delaying frailty for our aging population."Story continuesFor more information on Rejuvant, and its groundbreaking science and partnerships, please visit https://www.rejuvant.com.About Ponce De Leon HealthPonce De Leon Health (http://PDLHealth.com) is a commercial stage company focused on reversing epigenetic aging.
