Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for HollyFrontier:0.14 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$12b - US$1.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, HollyFrontier has an ROCE of 14%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. Remember that most companies like HollyFrontier are cyclical businesses. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.HollyFrontier's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCECurrent liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.HollyFrontier has total liabilities of US$1.7b and total assets of US$12b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 14% of its total assets. Low current liabilities are not boosting the ROCE too much.Our Take On HollyFrontier's ROCEStory continuesWith that in mind, HollyFrontier's ROCE appears pretty good.
