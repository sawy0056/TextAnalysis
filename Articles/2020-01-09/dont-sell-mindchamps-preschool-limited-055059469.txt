Check out our latest analysis for MindChamps PreSchool How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for MindChamps PreSchool:P/E of 23.33 = SGD0.46 ÷ SGD0.02 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each SGD1 the company has earned over the last year. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.How Does MindChamps PreSchool's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (17.9) for companies in the consumer services industry is lower than MindChamps PreSchool's P/E.SGX:CNE Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects MindChamps PreSchool will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.MindChamps PreSchool saw earnings per share decrease by 7.5% last year. But EPS is up 5.5% over the last 5 years. And EPS is down 13% a year, over the last 3 years. So you wouldn't expect a very high P/E.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Is Debt Impacting MindChamps PreSchool's P/E?MindChamps PreSchool has net debt equal to 30% of its market cap. While that's enough to warrant consideration, it doesn't really concern us.The Verdict On MindChamps PreSchool's P/E RatioMindChamps PreSchool trades on a P/E ratio of 23.3, which is above its market average of 13.4. With modest debt but no EPS growth in the last year, it's fair to say the P/E implies some optimism about future earnings, from the market.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
