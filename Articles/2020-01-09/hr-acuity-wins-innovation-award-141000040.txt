The comprehensive employee relations and investigations solution delivers built-in best practices and protocols, analytics and benchmarking so enterprises can protect their reputations, create fair workplaces and deliver trusted, consistent experiences for their people.Employees are a company's most valued asset, and it's essential that companies have tools to manage employee issues when they arise. However, in today's distributed and dynamic work environment, discovering, managing and responding to HR issues is extremely challenging – from everyday issues such as time and attendance to routine policy violations to more serious matters such as harassment investigations.Getting a complete picture of these issues is core to understanding risk for governance, risk and compliance (GRC) professionals, yet they and their HR partners are hampered by legacy and manual processes, or are using software solutions not designed to deal with people issues.HR Acuity is built specifically to deal with these issues. It has two core functions: employee relations management, for ongoing issues, and structured fact-finding for workplace investigations. Data and analytics underlie both, for 360-degree contextual intelligence and reporting, providing enterprises with insights on patterns and potential trouble spots – as well as areas of opportunity."Today's fragmented approach results in a reactive fire-fighting approach to employee risk that is inefficient, increases risk exposure and leads serious matters to fall through the cracks," said Michael Rasmussen, the GRC Pundit and lead analyst for GRC 20/20. "HR Acuity is an agile and intuitive solution for workplace issue reporting and case management that delivers significant business value and brings a contextual understanding of employee relations issues to HR, GRC professionals, management and senior executives and directors.""We are extremely honored to be recognized by GRC 20/20, the leading independent research firm in the governance, risk and compliance market, for our employee relations and investigations platform," said Deborah J. Muller, CEO and Founder of HR Acuity. "Employers have never been faced with greater reputational risk, and employees are demanding better workplaces. Consistent process, purpose-built technology and insightful analytics are essential for building fairer, safer employee experiences while protecting your company from risk."To read more about the HR Acuity GRC 20/20 Award and download the report, please visit the HR Acuity site.  About HR AcuityWhile you can't prevent every employee relations issue, you can change how you respond.
