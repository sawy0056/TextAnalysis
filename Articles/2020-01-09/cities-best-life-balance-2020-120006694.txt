In an ideal world, though, you earn enough to sock away sufficient savings to enjoy your leisure activities without logging excessive hours at the office or on a punishing commute. Not all cities allow professionals to strike a happy medium, so SmartAsset decided to take a look at the cities with the best work-life balance.To find the cities with the best work-life balance, we compared data for the 100 largest cities across the following 10 metrics: entertainment establishment density, dining establishment density, bar density, housing costs as a percentage of income, average number of weeks worked per year, average number of hours worked per week, average commute time, percentage of workers with commutes over an hour, unemployment rate and labor force participation rate. For details on our data sources and how we put all the information together to create our final rankings, check out the Data and Methodology section below.This is SmartAsset’s third study on the cities with the best work-life balance.

Five cities in this year’s study were in the top 10 in both our study from last year as well as the year before: Madison, Wisconsin; Lincoln, Nebraska; Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Ohio and Omaha, Nebraska.Little Northeast representation in top 25. According to the data that we considered, the Northeast is not the ideal region to settle down in if you prioritize work-life balance. Buffalo, New York and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, ranking sixth and 22nd overall, respectively, are the only two Northeastern cities to crack our top 25.1. Madison, WIMadison, Wisconsin takes the top spot in our study on the best cities for work-life balance. It ranks in the top 10% of the study for six out of the 10 metrics we considered.

Workers there have an average commute time of less than 20 minutes and work less than 37 hours per week on average. With all the time they’re saving, they’ll be able to enjoy other meaningful activities such as checking out art galleries or spending time with friends.
