See our latest analysis for Docebo Docebo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearDirector William Anderson made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for CA$294k worth of shares at a price of CA$15.70 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is CA$16.95.
