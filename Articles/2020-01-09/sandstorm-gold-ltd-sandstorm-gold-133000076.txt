("Sandstorm Gold Royalties", "Sandstorm" or the "Company") (NYSE American:SAND)(SSL.TO) is pleased to report that the Company has sold approximately 63,800 attributable gold equivalent ounces1 and realized preliminary revenue2 of $89.4 million for the full 2019 year, both representing a record for the Company.During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold approximately 16,100 attributable gold equivalent ounces1 and realized preliminary revenue2 of $24.0 million. Preliminary cost of sales, excluding depletion2 for the three month period was $5.0 million resulting in cash operating margins1 of approximately $1,180 per attributable gold equivalent ounce1. These results should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 as and when released.Note 1Sandstorm has included certain performance measures in this press release that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) including (i) attributable gold equivalent ounces and (ii) cash operating margin. The presentation of these non-IFRS measures is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Other companies may calculate these non-IFRS measures differently. Note these figures have not been audited and are subject to change. (i) As Sandstorm's operations are primarily focused on precious metals, the Company presents attributable gold equivalent ounces as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other mining companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. The Company's royalty and other commodity stream revenue is converted to an attributable gold equivalent ounce basis by dividing the royalty and other commodity stream revenue for that period by the average realized gold price per ounce from the Company's gold streams for the same respective period. These attributable gold equivalent ounces when combined with the gold ounces sold from the Company's gold streams equal total attributable gold equivalent ounces sold and may be subject to change. (ii) The Company presents cash operating margin as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. Cash operating margin is calculated by subtracting cost of sales, excluding depletion from revenue and dividing this figure by attributable gold equivalent ounces sold ([$24.0 Million - $5.0 Million]/16,100 attributable gold equivalent ounces).Note 2These figures have not been audited and are subject to change. As the Company has not yet finished its year-end annual close procedures, and the audit of its 2019 financial statements is not complete, the anticipated financial information presented in this press release is preliminary, subject to final year-end closing adjustments, and may change materially. The information presented above has not been audited by the Company's independent accountants, should not be considered a substitute for audited financial statements, and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company as to the actual financial results.CONTACT InformationFor more information about Sandstorm Gold Royalties, please visit our website at www.sandstormgold.com or email us at info@sandstormgold.com.ERFAN KAZEMICHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER604 689 0234KIM BERGENINVESTOR RELATIONS604 628 1164ABOUT SANDSTORM GOLD ROYALTIESSandstorm is a gold royalty company that provides upfront financing to gold mining companies that are looking for capital and in return, receives the right to a percentage of the gold produced from a mine, for the life of the mine.
