With the era of fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications approaching fast, DOCOMO will collaborate with MobiledgeX to help a variety of partners distribute innovative 5G solutions worldwide.MobiledgeX’s solution offers a developer portal site for distributing applications to MEC infrastructure, such as servers and storage systems, located on the edges of mobile operator networks that are close to customers in markets overseas. Developers, device manufacturers and other technology partners with stringent performance and data-governance needs will be able to distribute their applications quickly and easily worldwide, without having to confirm usage conditions or system availability in each operator’s MEC infrastructure, respectively.In the PoC, a “markerless” augmented-reality (AR) application based on the Edge Realities platform offered by 1000 realities, a Poland-based software studio, will be distributed to the MEC platform, DOCOMO Open Innovation Cloud™, connected to 5G and LTE networks operated by DOCOMO in Japan. Edge Realities uses space-recognition technology to superimpose AR content on real objects and large spaces without using place markers. Thanks to outsourcing all computation to the MEC platform and its low-latency network, Edge Realities will be fully hardware agnostic and useable on hardware that does not have native AR capabilities. The MEC platform will enable the content to be positioned in space and displayed, without any time lag. Tanseisha Co., Ltd. and DOCOMO Innovations, Inc. will support the PoC.Visitors to DOCOMO Open House 2020 will wear the smart glasses to enjoy real-time content according to their sightlines while viewing an exhibited painting. The event will take place in the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition complex in Tokyo on January 23 and 24.DOCOMO and MobiledgeX aim to collaborate on a range of innovative 5G solutions for the global market, which will be distributed in cooperation with partners in Japan and other countries.*”DOCOMO Open Innovation Cloud” is a trademark of NTT DOCOMO, INC.Contact:NTT DOCOMOGlobal Business Division Innovation & Business DevelopmentTel: +81 (0)3 5156 1156Fax: +81 (0)3 5156 0203www.nttdocomo.co.jp/englishMobiledgeX press@mobiledgex.comhttps://mobiledgex.comAbout DOCOMONTT DOCOMO, Japan's leading mobile operator with over 79 million subscriptions, is one of the world's foremost contributors to 3G, 4G and 5G mobile network technologies.
