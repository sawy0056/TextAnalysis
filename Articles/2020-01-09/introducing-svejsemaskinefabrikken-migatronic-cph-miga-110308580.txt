But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Svejsemaskinefabrikken Migatronic A/S (CPH:MIGA B) share price is up 61% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 4.9% in the last year. View our latest analysis for Svejsemaskinefabrikken Migatronic In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Svejsemaskinefabrikken Migatronic achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 18% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 10% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 11.23 also suggests market apprehension.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).CPSE:MIGA B Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Svejsemaskinefabrikken Migatronic's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Svejsemaskinefabrikken Migatronic, it has a TSR of 78% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveSvejsemaskinefabrikken Migatronic shareholders are down 2.9% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 25%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 12% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.
