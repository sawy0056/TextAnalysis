Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Season Pacific Holdings Limited (HKG:1709).Do Insider Transactions Matter?Most investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.We don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. See our latest analysis for Season Pacific Holdings The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Season Pacific HoldingsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman, Lui Cheung, sold HK$47m worth of shares at a price of HK$0.50 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of HK$0.66. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 17% of Lui Cheung's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Lui Cheung.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 114.56m shares for HK$61m.
