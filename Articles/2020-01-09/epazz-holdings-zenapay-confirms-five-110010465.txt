(OTC: EPAZ), a leading provider of drone technology, blockchain mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, has announced that its holding, ZenaPay Inc., has confirmed five preorders of patent-pending ZenaDrone Smart Farming Solution with GreenHeart CBD for Irish hemp farms. We are forecasting sales to be over $600,000 for the first year in 2020. We also believe the drone technology will generate profits its first year. The profits will be reinvested back into the technology.In August 2019, the ZenaPay team beta tested its drone-mapping and plant-tracking solutions in Ireland with GreenHeart and Hemp Tech hemp farms. The beta test was a success, and ZenaPay signed up additional customers.With the success of the beta test, ZenaPay Inc. and GreenHeart CBD LTD signed a distribution agreement for GreenHeart to sell ZenaDrone Smart Hemp Farming Solution to its network of farmers in Ireland and the United Kingdom with an option to expand through the European Union.Paul Walsh, CSO and co-founder of GreenHeart CBD LTD, said, “Every farmer in its network would be required to sign up with ZenaPay Smart Farming solution to assure the quality of his or her hemp plants. GreenHeart is quickly growing its network. Ireland and the United Kingdom have hundreds of hemp farms.”GreenHeart CBD has been featured on Ireland television services’ Ear on the Ground, Irish Independent newspaper, Health Europa and 103.2 Dublin City radio.ZenaPay will release ZenaDrone in April 2020. The ZenaPay team is heading back to Ireland in February to provide GreenHeart with demonstration models of ZenaDrone 1000 to assist in its efforts to grow its network of hemp farmers. Epazz, Inc. has provided ZenaPay, Inc. with an exclusive license to its patent pending drone technology. Epazz, Inc. is the largest shareholder of ZenaPay, Inc.ZenaDrone 1000 will be a workhorse for hemp farms, which will have multiple functions and features to scan fields and remove the male hemp plant to double female hemp production. The feedback we received from our trip to Ireland has provided us an opportunity to extend our technology to include tracking livestock and testing soil samples.ZenaDrone multispectral sensors (ZMS) provide five spectral bands (blue, green, red, red edge, near-infrared) which gather both visible wavelengths and wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This allows the ZMS to collect data and help farmers understand the health of their crops by analyzing the light reflecting off objects. When other bands are combined with near-infrared, farmers can determine the vegetation's stress level.According to MarketsAndMarkets.Com, the Industrial Global Hemp Market is forecasted to reach $26.6 billion USD by 2025. The report cited increased use of hempseed oil and hempseed in various food applications, rising use of nonpsychotropic cannabinoid cannabidiol hemp oil in food and pharmaceutical segments and increasing legalization of the cultivation of industrial hemp.Epazz sees major opportunities in providing critical technology solutions, both software and hardware, to service the Industrial Global Hemp. ZenaDrone is the first part of an overall technology offering.Dr. Shaun Passley, CEO of Epazz and ZenaPay, said, “This is a major opportunity to provide technology to the industrial hemp market. Our agreement with GreenHeart, we are able to access a large network of hemp farmers. We believe that artificial intelligence and our facial recognition technology are the next technologies to positively impact agriculture production.
