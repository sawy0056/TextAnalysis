(NASDAQ:EBAY)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we're going to take a look at the well-established eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$39.26 and falling to the lows of US$34.57. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether eBay's current trading price of US$35.62 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at eBay’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for eBay What's the opportunity in eBay?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 14% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy eBay today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $41.44, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that eBay’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from eBay?NasdaqGS:EBAY Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of eBay, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 1.2%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in EBAY’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on EBAY, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
