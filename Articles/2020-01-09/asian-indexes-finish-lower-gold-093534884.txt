Earlier in the session, the Shanghai benchmark touched its lowest in more than a week.Higher Oil Prices Threaten China EconomyYang Tingwu, vice general manager of hedge fund house Tongheng Investment, said his worst nightmare was that of a spreading Middle East crisis push oil prices higher, threatening to push China into stagflation.“I don’t think the trade war is a big issue now,” said Yang. “But a possible surge in energy prices will result in stagflation in China, limiting central bank’s policy choice.”If that happens, “Chinese stocks will descend into a gloomy, downward trend,” he added.Australian Shares Trim LossesAustralian shares trimmed losses on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump’s comment on the Middle East tensions reassured investors rattled by Iranian missile attacks on U.S.-led forces in Iraq earlier in the day.The actual attack stoked concerns about a broader regional conflict, but sentiment was lifted after Trump tweeted late Tuesday that “all is well!”, and added that an assessment of casualties and damage from the strikes was under way and that he would make a statement on Wednesday morning.Markets pulled back from the losses as the rhetoric was not as harsh as investors were expecting, said James Tao, market analysts at CommSec.Safe-haven gold stocks surged 3.2% to a near-month closing high, with heavyweight Newcrest Mining adding 4%.
