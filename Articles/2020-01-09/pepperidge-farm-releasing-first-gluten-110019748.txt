According to Statista, a statistics portal, the gluten-free food market is forecasted to reach $7.59 billion this year, with approximately 90 million Americans who maintain a gluten-free diet.Research suggests the boost in demand can be credited to an increase in medical concerns around celiac disease and broader health and wellness lifestyle choices. Celiac disease, a genetic autoimmune disease triggered by the consumption of gluten, affects at least 3 million Americans, according to the Center for Celiac Disease. According to the NPD Group, one in four adults are actively trying to cut back on gluten."Certainly, over the past decade, the demand for gluten-free has grown. Not only for medical concerns, but also as a broader lifestyle choice," said Lukin. "We saw an opportunity to deliver on what consumers are looking for."Follow Jazmin Goodwin on Twitter: @jazminkgoodwin.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Gluten-free cookies: Pepperidge Farm unveils first gluten-free productReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAnalysts Estimate Campbell Soup (CPB) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out forZacksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
