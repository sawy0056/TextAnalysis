(JACK)Reymerlyn MartinInsider MonkeyJanuary 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareWe are still in an overall bull market and many stocks that smart money investors were piling into surged in 2019. Among them, Facebook and Microsoft ranked among the top 3 picks and these stocks gained more than 57% each. Hedge funds' top 3 stock picks returned 45.7% last year and beat the S&P 500 ETFs by 14.5 percentage points. That's a big deal. This is why following the smart money sentiment is a useful tool at identifying the next stock to invest in.Is Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ:JACK) a bargain? Prominent investors are reducing their bets on the stock. The number of bullish hedge fund bets fell by 4 lately. Our calculations also showed that JACK isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q3 rankings and see the video at the end of this article for Q2 rankings).So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the Russell 2000 ETFs by 40 percentage points since May 2014 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren't comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in stocks that are in our short portfolio.[caption id="attachment_30594" align="aligncenter" width="600"] Barry Rosenstein of JANA Partners[/caption]View photosBarry Rosenstein JANA PARTNERSMoreWe leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example Europe is set to become the world's largest cannabis market, so we check out this European marijuana stock pitch. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. This December, we recommended Adams Energy as a one-way bet based on an under-the-radar fund manager's investor letter and the stock is still extremely cheap despite already gaining 20 percent. Keeping this in mind we're going to take a look at the key hedge fund action regarding Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ:JACK).How are hedge funds trading Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ:JACK)?Heading into the fourth quarter of 2019, a total of 29 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of -12% from one quarter earlier.

At the top of the heap, Robert Pohly's Samlyn Capital cut the largest stake of the "upper crust" of funds tracked by Insider Monkey, comprising close to $40.8 million in stock, and Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital was right behind this move, as the fund cut about $16.6 million worth.
