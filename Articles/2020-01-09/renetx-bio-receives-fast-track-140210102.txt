In addition to profound persistent neurological impairment, patients with chronic SCI suffer a variety of other health consequences including respiratory complications, cardiovascular complications, urinary and bowel complications, spasticity, pain syndromes, pressure ulcers, osteoporosis, and bone fractures. Treatment for chronic SCI consists primarily of physical and/or occupational therapy.  Recovery from SCI after the first few weeks following injury is limited, as axonal growth is virtually non-existent in the adult spinal cord.  "This Fast Track Designation from the FDA recognizes the high unmet medical need in patients with SCI," said Erika R. Smith, MBA, CEO of ReNetX Bio.  "Fast track designation will help facilitate ReNetX Bio’s development of AXER-204, and potentially expedite future regulatory review of AXER-204 for patients with SCI."About Fast Track DesignationAs one of its Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions, the FDA grants Fast Track Designation to "facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need" in order to make important new drugs available to patients earlier. According to the FDA, a drug that receives Fast Track Designation is eligible for some or all of the following:More frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug's development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval;More frequent written communication from FDA about such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers;Eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, if relevant criteria are met; andEligibility for Rolling Review, which means that a drug company can submit completed sections of its New Drug Application (NDA) for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the NDA is completed before the entire application can be reviewed. NDA review usually does not begin until the drug company has submitted the entire application to the FDA.About the Phase 1/2 RESET Study:  For more information, please visit ClinicalTrials.gov.About ReNetX Bio, Inc.:  For more information, please visit www.renetx.comCONTACT:info@renetx.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhy This Small Gene Therapy Player Rocketed On A Biogen DealInvestor's Business Daily5 Things You Should Know About Spinal Muscular AtrophyThe MightyBiohaven drug wins U.S. FDA approval for use in relieving migraine headachesReutersBiotech Stock Crumbles To Three-Year Low On Delayed Seizure DrugInvestor's Business DailyFDA Reminds Patients that Devices Claiming to Clean, Disinfect or Sanitize CPAP Machines Using Ozone Gas or UV Light Have Not Been FDA AuthorizedPR NewswireBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
