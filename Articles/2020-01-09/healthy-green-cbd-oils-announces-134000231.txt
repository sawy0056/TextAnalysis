The research seeks to explore the economic and environmental viability of large-scale industrial hemp growth in the state of Florida. Healthy Green CBD Oils is one of the largest and most trusted names in CBD oil product providers."We are so happy and excited to help lead the way in exploring the economic potential of this young but thriving industry," said Louisa Segarra, Vice President of Healthy Green CBD Oil. "We have always believed in the ability of hemp-related products to help treat a variety of problems. But we also firmly believe in the power of hemp to beneficially transform the economy for the state of Florida, and eventually, the U.S. The potential for this miracle plant has remained untapped for so long. That's about to change."The two-year pilot project involves processing and market research related solely to industrial products derived from hemp, and is tightly controlled by UF. Project goals include identifying hemp varieties that are suitable for planning in Florida's various natural environments, the development of economically feasible hemp-management practices and cropping systems for Florida, and the assessment of hemp invasion risks for both natural and built Floridian environments. Project outcomes will be reported to the state legislature of Florida for review.Pilot Project Research SpecificsThe pilot project will focus on three specific topics: varieties, management and invasion risks.Varieties: 31 certified varieties of hemp are under study, including growth and plant features such as gemination, flowering, height, biomass, yield, THC and CBD content. Management: There are three production sites, at 7–10 acres each. Management studies will include spacing needed for maximum production as well as fertilizer trials. Invasion Risks: Hemp will be grown in both field trials and greenhouses, studying control measures for each to minimize escape and invasion risks. Differences in Industrial Hemp vs. Medical Marijuana UseCannabis sativa leaves and plant material with THC contents greater than 0.3-percent are those classified and used in medical marijuana applications. Such applications include research into the treatment of a wide range of diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and symptom-treatment for other illnesses like PTSD, pain and nausea.The current study at UF focuses solely on industrial hemp. Industrial hemp has less than 0.3-percent THC per dry weight and is a potentially valuable alternative crop that has been successfully used for a wide variety of commercial and industrial products like textiles, clothing, paper, bioplastics, biofuel, insulation and food. Derived from the cannabis sativa plant, industrial hemp is non-psychoactive and completely safe for consumer use. What makes industrial hemp so useful to industry are its uniquely broad applications. It can be fashioned into fiber (textiles), food (hemp seed oil and greens), building materials (hempcrete), bioplastics and feed for livestock.Learn more about the UF pilot project HERE.
