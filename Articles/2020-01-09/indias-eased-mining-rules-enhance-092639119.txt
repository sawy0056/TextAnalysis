That attracted criticism from the industry which said the rules discouraged bidding.The auctions are aimed at attracting global miners such as Glencore Plc <GLEN.L>, BHP Group <BHP.AX> <BHPB.L>, Anglo American PLC <AAL.L> and Peabody Energy Corp <BTU.N>.India, one of the world's biggest coal producers, expects it to remain its main energy source as the fuel helps produce inexpensive electricity, even as many countries are looking to reduce coal use and cut greenhouse gas emissions."Previously there was a restriction that anybody participating in the auction should have coal mining operations in India. That restriction we are removing," Joshi said.Joshi said recent auctions of coal blocks had drawn a tepid response from mining companies because of restrictions on the way the coal could be used.Out of 99 coal blocks auctioned since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, only 29 attracted firm bids."We feel that because of the end use restriction, the participation in the auction was restricted and comparatively less. Now we are withdrawing all these restrictions," he said.The move could hurt prospects for state-run Coal India Ltd. Shares of the company fell as much as 3.6% after Joshi's comments, but pared some gains to settle down 2.7% at 200.20 rupees ($2.80).Joshi also said the government has amended mining laws to fast-track mining at sites where leases have lapsed, to avert an iron ore shortage."The auction process has already begun," Joshi said.The amended laws will also boost exploration and auction of "deep-seated minerals like gold and diamond," he said.The plans still need presidential approval, and a government spokeswoman said more details will be provided after that. Presidential approval is generally a mere formality.(Reporting by Nidhi Verma and Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Susan Fenton)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIndia insist 'no panic' ahead of must-win New Zealand TestAFPFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergTrump campaign ads target a new audience: Indian AmericansPoliticoUS urges India to allow peaceful assembly after riotsAFPA Delhi neighborhood divided by a highway and now hatredReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
