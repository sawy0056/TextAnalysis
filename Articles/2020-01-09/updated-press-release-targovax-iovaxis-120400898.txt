In IOVaxis we have found an ideal partner committed to neoantigen vaccine development in China, the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world. This is both a commercially attractive arrangement for Targovax and will also enable new TG studies to further demonstrate the clinical benefit of our mutant RAS vaccination concept. Therefore, this is an important step for the TG program and Targovax."Dr. John Wang, CEO of IOVaxis, said: "We are excited to enter into this collaboration with Targovax. IOVaxis is a pioneer in neoantigen cancer vaccine development in China, and we have been searching for suitable shared neoantigen vaccine products to in-license for regional development. Mutant RAS solid tumors are prevalent and a high unmet medical need in China, particularly in pancreatic and colorectal cancers, and we therefore believe the TG01 and TG02 vaccines have significant local commercial potential and can benefit a large number of patients".For further information, please contact:Renate Birkeli, Investor RelationsPhone: +47-922-61-624Email: renate.birkeli@targovax.com Media and IR enquires:Andreas TinglumCorporate Communications (Norway)Phone: +47-9300-1770Email: andreas.tinglum@corpcom.no This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/targovax/r/updated-press-release--targovax-and-iovaxis-therapeutics-enters-option-agreement-for-tg-mutant-ras-v,c3004603CisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/updated-press-release-targovax-and-iovaxis-therapeutics-enters-option-agreement-for-tg-mutant-ras-vaccine-license-and-clinical-development-in-china-300983469.htmlSOURCE TargovaxReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBTS cancel concerts as South Korea coronavirus cases pass 2,000AFPNations take drastic measures as coronavirus outbreak spreadsMarketWatchAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPBaidu says first-quarter revenue may tumble as coronavirus takes toll on business, advertisingReutersGlobal coronavirus cases rise as China’s downward trend continuesPA Media: World NewsBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
