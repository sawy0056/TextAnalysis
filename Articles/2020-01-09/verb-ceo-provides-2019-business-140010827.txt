Our application is perfectly aligned with this fast-growing sales phenomenon and we expect that it will generate the type of impressive results our clients are currently experiencing in the direct sales space.Simultaneously, we intend to continue our expansion into other business sectors, including, automotive sales, education, medical/pharmaceutical, CBD, real estate, among other business sectors each of which will benefit greatly from our platform.We intend to launch the world’s first interactive video webinar platform that will allow anyone, selling anything, the ability to host a live broadcast in which they can showcase and demonstrate their product and then give all the webinar viewers the ability to click on the screen and purchase the products in real time, right in the video while their interest level is peaked.We intend to launch a series of new features and functionality in our CRM platform that will allow us to generate greater revenue per user, not only from new users but immediately from our current 937,000 and growing user base. These features will include in-app purchase capability that our users can subscribe for directly through the app, for behind the pay-wall, sales-driving, affordable features and functionality.We intend to execute on our existing partnership agreements with Salesforce and Microsoft, among others, through the launch of our newly designed and enhanced core interactive video sales enablement, lead-gen, and analytics/tracking/reporting application as an upgrade feature within Salesforce and Microsoft products, offered on a revenue share basis, to their respective current and future clients and customers.We intend to announce new direct sales back-end software provider partnerships, pursuant to which these partners will offer their current and future clients a tightly integrated, enhanced solution combining their back-end application that tracks affiliate rep sales, payments and genealogy, among other things, with our CRM and sales enablement mobile application.We intend to launch a long-planned channel sales initiative, creating an entirely new revenue stream through an extended outside network. We expect this to add substantial leverage to our sales and revenue stream in 2020 and beyond.We remain focused on creating and delivering long-term, sustained shareholder value, based on strong, underlying business fundamentals, achieved through best-of-class, innovative, SaaS-based sales applications for the new social economy that produce measurable results for our continually growing, satisfied client base.”About VERBVERB Technology Company, Inc. (VERB) is rapidly emerging as the market leader in interactive video-based customer relationship management (“CRM”) sales and marketing applications.
