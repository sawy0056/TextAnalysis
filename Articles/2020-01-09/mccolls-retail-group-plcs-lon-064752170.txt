We'll look at McColl's Retail Group plc's (LON:MCLS) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price.

That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does McColl's Retail Group Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio.

That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.McColl's Retail Group shrunk earnings per share by 45% over the last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 6.9% per year over the last five years. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 28% per year over the last three years. This could justify a low P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does McColl's Retail Group's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?McColl's Retail Group has net debt worth a very significant 191% of its market capitalization. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you must keep in mind that these debt levels would usually warrant a relatively low P/E.The Verdict On McColl's Retail Group's P/E RatioMcColl's Retail Group trades on a P/E ratio of 6.7, which is below the GB market average of 18.6.
