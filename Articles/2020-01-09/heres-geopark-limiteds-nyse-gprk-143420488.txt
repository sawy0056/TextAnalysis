We'll look at GeoPark Limited's (NYSE:GPRK) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. What is GeoPark's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 14.68.

I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.GeoPark's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 161% last year.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.So What Does GeoPark's Balance Sheet Tell Us?GeoPark has net debt equal to 27% of its market cap. While that's enough to warrant consideration, it doesn't really concern us.The Verdict On GeoPark's P/E RatioGeoPark trades on a P/E ratio of 14.7, which is below the US market average of 18.7. The company hasn't stretched its balance sheet, and earnings growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified. Because analysts are predicting more growth in the future, one might have expected to see a higher P/E ratio.
