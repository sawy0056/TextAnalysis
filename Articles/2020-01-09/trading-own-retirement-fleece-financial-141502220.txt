You're an accomplished investor. You've done truly well selecting stocks. You probably already own a couple of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like:CNB Financial (CCNE), Armada Hoffler Properties (AHH) and Arbor Realty Trust (ABR).If this sounds like you, then here's a question: With your background and skills, should you manage your own retirement investments?It could be a good idea - that is, if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings. However, if you're like the rest of us, there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals.Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk - reward mindset than investing for retirement.How Diversification Differs from Stock PickingPicking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns - but also carries a lot of risk, which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement.In fact, a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4% of equities produced all of the stock market's gains over the last 90 years. All other stocks "broke even" with the increases of 38% canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58%.Those numbers reinforce that, even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker, your chances of success over a long period are very slim.Is it Possible to Invest "Rationally"?Investors think they can make rational decisions, but research shows that the opposite is often true. A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S&P 500. Over 30 years, the S&P 500 returned 10.35%, but the average investor return was just 3.66%.It is interesting to note that the period covered by this study includes the 1987 crash, the 2000 bear market, and the Great Recession of 2008, as well as the bull market of the 1990s.This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets - and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes.Curiously, even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can't resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices. They might be overly self-assured and miscalculate risk, get attached to a price target, or perceive a pattern that does not exist. This behavioral fallacy, over the long-term, can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement.The Bottom Line for Retirement InvestorsYour retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades - not days, weeks or quarters. Most self-directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long-term results.Does that mean you should quit trading? Not really. One plan is to take 10% of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns.But the point we're making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative, long-term approach designed to produce reliable returns, so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals.Do You Know the Top 9 Retirement Investing Mistakes?Whether you're planning to retire early or not, don't let investing mistakes derail your plans.If you have $500,000 or more to invest and want to learn more, click the link to download our free report, 9 Retirement Mistakes that will Ruin Your Retirement.This report will help you steer clear of the most common mistakes, like trying to time the market, lack of diversification in your portfolio, and many more.
