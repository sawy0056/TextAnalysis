Before fees and expenses, EMGF seeks to match the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Diversified Multiple-Factor Index.The MSCI Emerging Markets Diversified Multiple Factor Index is composed of stocks of large and mid-capitalization companies in emerging markets that have favourable exposure to target style factors subject to constraints.Cost & Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for EMGF are 0.45%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 2.66%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.Looking at individual holdings, Alibaba Group Holding Adr Represen (BABA) accounts for about 3.57% of total assets, followed by Sk Hynix Inc and Yum China Holdings Inc (YUMC).The top 10 holdings account for about 23.32% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -0.86% and was up about 18.27% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 01/08/2020), respectively. EMGF has traded between $38.50 and $46.26 during this last 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.96 and standard deviation of 16.77% for the trailing three-year period. With about 272 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Emerging Markets ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Emerging Market ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are other ETFs in the space which investors should consider.IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has $62.06 B in assets, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has $67.05 B.
