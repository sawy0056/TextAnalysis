There has been a surge in platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions utilizing APIs.The report, The Emergence of API Platforms: Open Banking Drives New Business Models, identifies the technical and regulatory issues that continue to be challenges to lift-off for the European Union's open banking vision and contrasts that situation with the structures that have driven a surge in the availability of cloud platforms that utilize APIs to enable similar services, such as payments."In a past report we identified the game-changing value proposition associated with internet-based application programming interfaces. This report identifies why the implementation of APIs has failed to help the EU Open Banking initiative gain liftoff even as these APIs have created a surge in the number of cloud-based platforms recently announced," commented the author of the report, Tim Sloane, VP, Payments Innovation, and Director, Emerging Technologies Advisory Service at Mercator Advisory Group.Highlights of the research report:Identifies six API deployment strategies, including recent platform-as-a-service (PaaS) business models. Identifies the issues that have delayed, and will continue to delay, broad adoption of the EU Open Banking initiative. Identifies APIs currently available from major U.S. banks as a contrast to the APIs mandated under PSD2. Discusses the new cloud-based platform products and services released by Visa and Mastercard that support and challenge the E.U. initiatives. Indicates the capabilities needed to deploy a platform-as-a-service solution, which also suggests areas of the PSD2 initiative that need to be strengthened.
