This will enable the company to enhance customer experience by facilitating easy integration of its devices with other products.One of the enhanced smart home experiences that iRobot is likely to offer to its customers is the ability to assign its Roomba and Braava products in cleaning rooms with the help of voice assistant integrations. As noted by the company, customers can also schedule the timing for cleaning purposes per their choice. We believe such partnerships are likely to create new opportunities for the company’s automation field and boost its connected product base.Although iRobot’s diversified product portfolio and innovative capabilities have been benefiting it over time, the global industrial robotics market is facing headwinds from the imposition of trade tariffs for robotic vacuums. Higher tariffs on China imports might put additional cost pressure on iRobot, and in turn weigh on revenues and margins. For 2019, the company expects to incur $35-$40 million of tariff-related costs.Analysts have become increasingly bearish about the company over the past seven days.
