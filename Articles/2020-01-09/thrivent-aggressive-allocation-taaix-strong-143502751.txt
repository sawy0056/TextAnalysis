TAAIX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.ObjectiveTAAIX is classified in the Allocation Balanced segment by Zacks, which is an area full of possibilities. Here, investors are able to get a good head start with diversified mutual funds, and play around with core holding options for a portfolio of funds. Allocation Balanced funds look to invest across a balance of asset types, like stocks, bonds, and cash, though including precious metals or commodities is not unusual; these funds are mostly categorized by their respective asset allocation.History of Fund/ManagerThrivent is responsible for TAAIX, and the company is based out of Appleton, WI. Since Thrivent Aggressive Allocation S made its debut in June of 2005, TAAIX has garnered more than $408.20 million in assets. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 8.35%, and is in the top third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 11.66%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of TAAIX over the past three years is 11.14% compared to the category average of 8.63%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 11.47% compared to the category average of 8.7%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should always remember the downsides to a potential investment, and this segment carries some risks one should be aware of. In TAAIX's case, the fund lost 49.34% in the most recent bear market and underperformed comparable funds by 13%. This could mean that the fund is a worse choice than comparable funds during a bear market.Even still, the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.94, so investors should note that it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. TAAIX has generated a negative alpha over the past five years of -1.79, demonstrating that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.ExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, TAAIX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.74% compared to the category average of 0.92%. So, TAAIX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,000 and that each subsequent investment needs to be at $50.Bottom LineOverall, Thrivent Aggressive Allocation S ( TAAIX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.Want even more information about TAAIX?
