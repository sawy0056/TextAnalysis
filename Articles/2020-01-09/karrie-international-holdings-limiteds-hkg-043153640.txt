We'll use ROE to examine Karrie International Holdings Limited (HKG:1050), by way of a worked example.Our data shows Karrie International Holdings has a return on equity of 22% for the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every HK$1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn HK$0.22. View our latest analysis for Karrie International Holdings How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Karrie International Holdings:22% = HK$248m ÷ HK$1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does Return On Equity Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does Karrie International Holdings Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Karrie International Holdings has a superior ROE than the average (9.7%) company in the Electronic industry.SEHK:1050 Past Revenue and Net Income, January 8th 2020MoreThat is a good sign. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example, I often check if insiders have been buying shares.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining Karrie International Holdings's Debt And Its 22% Return On EquityKarrie International Holdings has a debt to equity ratio of 0.64, which is far from excessive. When I see a high ROE, fuelled by only modest debt, I suspect the business is high quality. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
