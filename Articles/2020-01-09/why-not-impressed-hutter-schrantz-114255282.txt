To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Hutter & Schrantz has total liabilities of €3.4m and total assets of €13m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 26% of its total assets. This is a modest level of current liabilities, which will have a limited impact on the ROCE.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Hutter & Schrantz's ROCEThat's not a bad thing, however Hutter & Schrantz has a weak ROCE and may not be an attractive investment.
