(the "Corporation" or "Experion") (EXP.V)(EXPFF)(MB31.F) Given the recent leadership change announced on January 6, 2020, Experion Holdings Ltd.'s newly appointed CEO and Director, Jarret Malnarick, is pleased to share some immediate strategy and objectives going forward for the CompanyAs the Canadian cannabis industry continues to be challenged with inflated financial forecasts, oversupply of low-quality product and delayed licensing of retail outlets to drive sales, investors and financers have lost confidence in the cannabis sector making it difficult to obtain favorable business valuations and to raise capital. During this time, cannabis companies must continue to evolve to address the changing conditions of the industry by becoming laser focused, leverage all assets at its disposal and carve a swift path to profitability. Key strategic objectives must center around revenue generation and rightsizing cannabis companies through cost restructuring.The following is a summary of Experion's efforts to reduce costs while continuing to grow revenue over the quarter: Cost Reduction MeasuresReduce office expenditures including closures of certain offices deemed unnecessaryTerminate roles considered redundantHibernate the clinical trial and related research; to be further reviewed when the market environment improvesRenegotiate consulting and services feesOptimize business processes and functionsAccumulation of the above actions will result in a 30% reduction (minimum) in SG&A annuallyRevenue Growth InitiativesIncrease current facility's cultivation footprint by 20% by mid 2020 with minimal capital expenditureUnlock increased processing space with Health Canada which doubles manufacturing capacity by mid 2020 (renovations completed in FY2019)Improve cultivation capacity with quality grow partnersBecome an efficient premium Consumer Packaging Goods processorOpen additional distribution channels across CanadaIncrease product diversity by offering additional strains and introducing pre-rollsExplore M&A opportunities with another licensed producer to achieve increased cultivation and further economies of scaleDespite a difficult market and some early disappointments with certain sector leaders, there remains a tremendous opportunity for cannabis companies on the path to profitable growth. This is the future that we see for Experion as it continues to develop strong brands (Citizen Stash and Kanabe) backed by premium Consumer Packaged Goods distributed across the Canadian market generating high margin revenue. This strategy will ultimately build a foundation for long term profits.In the coming weeks, we will be publishing an updated corporate presentation as well as an investor update.Thank you,Jarrett Malnarich, CEOAbout Experion Holdings Ltd.Experion Holdings Ltd. is the parent company of Experion Biotechnologies Inc., a Health Canada licensed cultivator and processor of Cannabis, based in Mission, BC.Experion Holdings Ltd. is invested in a portfolio of products to address a wide spectrum of consumer needs' including Medical, Adult-use, and Wellness and Therapeutic products.Experion trades on the TSX Venture Exchange as a Tier 1 issuer under the symbol "EXP" on the OTCQB Venture under the symbol "EXPFF" and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol "MB31"For further information, please visit the Company's website www.experionwellness.com or join our Global Investor Forum on 8020 http://connects.company/ExperionEXP where you can read all press releases or contact Investor Relations, Email: IR@experionwellness.comDisclosureThis press release contains forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws.
