By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Falck Renewables S.p.A. (BIT:FKR).Falck Renewables has a ROE of 11%, based on the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every €1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn €0.11. View our latest analysis for Falck Renewables How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Falck Renewables:11% = €64m ÷ €563m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does ROE Signify?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does Falck Renewables Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Falck Renewables has a superior ROE than the average (5.0%) company in the Renewable Energy industry.BIT:FKR Past Revenue and Net Income, January 8th 2020MoreThat is a good sign. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. One data point to check is if insiders have bought shares recently.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Falck Renewables's Debt And Its 11% ROEIt's worth noting the significant use of debt by Falck Renewables, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.38. There's no doubt the ROE is respectable, but it's worth keeping in mind that metric is elevated by the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
