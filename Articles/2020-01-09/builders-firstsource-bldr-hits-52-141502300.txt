This represents a year-over-year change of 6.86% and 4.81%, respectively.Valuation MetricsBuilders FirstSource may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Builders FirstSource has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 11.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 9.2X versus its peer group's average of 9.7X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Builders FirstSource currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Builders FirstSource meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Builders FirstSource shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Builders FirstSource Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Builders FirstSource have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Lithia Motors (LAD), Dollar General (DG), and Casey's General Stores (CASY), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 17% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Builders FirstSource, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
