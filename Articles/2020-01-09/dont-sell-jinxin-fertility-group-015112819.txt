We'll look at Jinxin Fertility Group Limited's (HKG:1951) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Jinxin Fertility Group has a P/E ratio of 69.73, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 1.4%. Check out our latest analysis for Jinxin Fertility Group How Do I Calculate Jinxin Fertility Group's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price (in reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Jinxin Fertility Group:P/E of 69.73 = HK$10.00 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, CNY ) ÷ HK$0.14 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Jinxin Fertility Group Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. The image below shows that Jinxin Fertility Group has a significantly higher P/E than the average (16.1) P/E for companies in the healthcare industry.SEHK:1951 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Jinxin Fertility Group will outperform other companies in its industry. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Jinxin Fertility Group saw earnings per share decrease by 10% last year. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 36% per year over the last five years. This might lead to muted expectations.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does Jinxin Fertility Group's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Jinxin Fertility Group has net cash of CN¥3.2b. This is fairly high at 13% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Verdict On Jinxin Fertility Group's P/E RatioWith a P/E ratio of 69.7, Jinxin Fertility Group is expected to grow earnings very strongly in the years to come. The recent drop in earnings per share might keep value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
