But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Enstar Group (NASDAQ:ESGR). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for Enstar Group How Fast Is Enstar Group Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, Enstar Group has grown EPS by 15% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). Not all of Enstar Group's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. The good news is that Enstar Group is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 19.0 percentage points to 26%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in my book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.It's a pleasure to note that insiders spent US$8.0m buying Enstar Group shares, over the last year, without reporting any share sales whatsoever. And so I find myself almost expectant, and certainly hopeful, that this large outlay signals prescient optimism for the business. It is also worth noting that it was Co-Founder Dominic Silvester who made the biggest single purchase, worth US$4.7m, paying US$170 per share.On top of the insider buying, it's good to see that Enstar Group insiders have a valuable investment in the business. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$189m. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.While insiders already own a significant amount of shares, and they have been buying more, the good news for ordinary shareholders does not stop there. That's because on our analysis the CEO, Dominic Silvester, is paid less than the median for similar sized companies. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Enstar Group with market caps between US$2.0b and US$6.4b is about US$5.1m.Story continuesEnstar Group offered total compensation worth US$3.4m to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given its below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is Enstar Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Enstar Group is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. On top of that, we've seen insiders buying shares even though they already own plenty. To me, that all makes it well worth a spot on your watchlist, as well as continuing research. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of Enstar Group.The good news is that Enstar Group is not the only growth stock with insider buying. Here's
