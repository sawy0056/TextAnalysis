That's because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses - and with people generally living longer, the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period.The tried - and - true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas at the time of this article, the current rate is under 2% and looks to stay low thanks to an accommodative Fed.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).For example, AT&T and Coca-Cola are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3% or better. Look for stocks like this that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3%, and positive average annual dividend growth. Many stocks increase dividends over time, helping to offset the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.The First of Long Island (FLIC) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.18 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.03%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 1.78% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.8%. In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $0.72 is up 5.88% from last year.H&R Block (HRB) is paying out a dividend of 0.26 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.42% compared to the Consumer Services - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&P 500's yield. Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.04 is up 4% from last year.Currently paying a dividend of 0.16 per share, Navient (NAVI) has a dividend yield of 4.71%. This is compared to the Financial - Consumer Loans industry's yield of 0% and the S&P 500's current yield. Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $0.64 is flat compared to last year.But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs?

If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Story continuesBottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement.To learn more ways to maximize your assets - and avoid pitfalls that could jeopardize your financial security - download our free report:Will You Retire a Multi-Millionaire? 7 Things You Can Do NowThis helpful guide offers our viewpoints about strategic retirement investment planning, based on decades of experience helping our clients prepare for financial security during their golden years.
