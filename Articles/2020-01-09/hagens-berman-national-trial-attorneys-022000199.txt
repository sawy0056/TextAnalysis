Among other things, the Company increased its impairment loss on inventory by about 14% for the fiscal year and announced material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting."We're focused on investors' losses and proving Defendants knowingly provided false financial information to the market," said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.If you purchased HEXO common stock during the Class Period and suffered significant losses, click here to discuss your legal rights with Hagens Berman.Whistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding HEXO should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.
