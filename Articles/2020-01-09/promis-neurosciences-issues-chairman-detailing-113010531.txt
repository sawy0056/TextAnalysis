(PMN.TO) (ARFXF), a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of antibody therapeutics targeting toxic oligomers implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, issued today a Chairman’s Update, which discusses the outlook for the company’s pipeline in light of anticipated regulatory approval for the first disease modifying therapy for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accumulating data continue to validate the need for a drug candidate with improved selectivity for amyloid-beta oligomers (AßO). Compared to Aß-directed antibodies in development, ProMIS’ lead therapeutic antibody candidate, PMN310 demonstrates superior selectivity for toxic AßOs, and great potential as a next-generation, disease-modifying therapy candidate for AD.“We are finally turning the corner in Alzheimer’s disease,” said ProMIS Neurosciences’ Executive Chairman Eugene Williams, who authored the Chairman’s Update. “In this decade, physicians and researchers alike will gain access to new non-invasive biomarkers that will allow them to diagnose Alzheimer’s earlier, monitor disease progression and significantly, develop next-generation therapies faster and with greater efficiency and lower costs than traditional clinical trials have allowed. I believe this will enable drug developers to usher not one but a portfolio of Alzheimer’s therapies to this patient community in dire need of effective treatment.”Mr. Williams continued: “ProMIS is in a unique position to contribute to and benefit from this unprecedented momentum. Our diverse portfolio includes differentiated antibodies selectively targeting toxic forms of Aß and tau along with robust discovery efforts to target additional misfolded proteins involved in neuroinflammation and neuroprotection. At the precipice of what is poised to be a radical phase of progress in addressing this devastating disease, we are invigorated by the promise of our path and steadfast in our commitment to patients, our investors and the research community at large.”To access the Chairman’s Update, please visit www.promisneurosciences.com or visit https://promisneurosciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ProMIS-Chairmans-Note.Jan_.08.2020.pdf.To learn more about the search for therapies for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases, listen to Saving Minds at iTunes or Spotify.About PMN310PMN310 is a next generation drug candidate that offers more precise selectivity for AßOs, which is expected to provide greater clinical benefit and safety. Created using a novel drug discovery and development platform that can uniquely and precisely target the toxic forms of otherwise normal proteins, PMN310 demonstrates a high degree of binding to toxic oligomers without binding to non-toxic forms of amyloid-beta. Data also demonstrate PMN310’s potential for greater therapeutic potency versus other Aß-directed antibodies.
