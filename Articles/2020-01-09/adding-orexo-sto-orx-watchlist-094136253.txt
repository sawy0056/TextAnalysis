But as Warren Buffett has mused, 'If you've been playing poker for half an hour and you still don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy.' When they buy such story stocks, investors are all too often the patsy.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Orexo (STO:ORX). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for Orexo Orexo's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Orexo's earnings per share took off like a rocket; fast, and from a low base. So the actual rate of growth doesn't tell us much. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Like the last firework on New Year's Eve accelerating into the sky, Orexo's EPS shot from kr3.27 to kr6.70, over the last year. Year on year growth of 105% is certainly a sight to behold.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). The good news is that Orexo is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.4 percentage points to 21%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.In the last year insider at Orexo were both selling and buying shares; but happily, as a group they spent kr1.1m more on stock, than they netted from selling it. On balance, that's a good sign. Zooming in, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by President & CEO Nikolaj Sørensen for kr1.1m worth of shares, at about kr72.23 per share.Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Orexo is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Indeed, they hold kr131m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. That amounts to 6.1% of the company, demonstrating a degree of high-level alignment with shareholders.Is Orexo Worth Keeping An Eye On?Orexo's earnings per share have taken off like a rocket aimed right at the moon. What's more insiders own a significant stake in the company and have been buying more shares. Because of the potential that it has reached an inflection point, I'd suggest Orexo belongs on the top of your watchlist. Of course, just because Orexo is growing does not mean it is undervalued.
