CITIC Capital said it is "actively participating" in the bidding process.McDonald's said the transaction would not affect its business strategy and daily operations in mainland China and Hong Kong.The deal comes months after CITIC Capital raised $2.8 billion in its fourth China buyout fund, the firm's biggest private equity fund to date, bolstering its ability to cut deals in the world's second-largest economy.CITIC Ltd is selling the 22% stake via Fast Food Holdings Ltd, a holding firm that it set up with CITIC Capital for the combined controlling stake of 52% in McDonald's China and Hong Kong business.McDonald's Corp in early 2017 agreed to sell 80% of such business to CITIC Ltd <0267.HK>, CITIC Capital and Carlyle Group LP <CG.O> for $2.08 billion, saying at the time that they hoped tying up with local partners could speed up growth in China.CITIC Ltd held 32% of the business, with CITIC Capital and Carlyle holding 20% and 28%, respectively. McDonald's retained the remaining 20%, the companies said in a statement at the time.After the stake sale, CITIC Ltd will retain 10% of the business.In late 2017, the U.S. fast food giant changed its registered business name https://reut.rs/37VX7rB to "Golden Arches (China) Co Ltd" in China and planned to nearly double the number of its outlets in mainland China to 4,500 by 2022.(Reporting by Julie Zhu and Twinnie Siu in Hong Kong, Se Young Lee in Beijing; Additional Reporting by Brenda Goh in Shanghai, Sophie Yu and Zhang Yan in Beijing ; Editing by Tom Hogue and Rashmi Aich)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergGlobal coronavirus cases rise as China’s downward trend continuesPA Media: World NewsChina's February factory PMI seen at lowest since 2009 as coronavirus slams production: Reuters pollReutersThe 6 largest coronavirus outbreaks outside of ChinaCBS NewsHong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested on illegal assembly chargesReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
