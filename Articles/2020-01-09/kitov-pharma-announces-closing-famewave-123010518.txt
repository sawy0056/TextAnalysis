CM-24 has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile and an initial signal of monotherapy efficacy in a phase 1 clinical study.  As previously announced, Kitov, in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, intends to initiate a phase 1b/2a clinical trial of CM-24 in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo®) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the second half of 2020.  Kitov has acquired 100% of FameWave from its shareholders in exchange for $10 million worth of Kitov’s newly issued ADSs with a long-term lock-up period, priced at $1.23 per ADS, plus 50% warrant coverage based on an exercise price of $1.98 per ADS with a 4-year term. Under the terms of the agreement, OrbiMed, Pontifax and Arkin Holdings, leading life-science focused investment funds, are exchanging their shares in FameWave for Kitov ADSs and warrants, and investing $3.5 million in Kitov in exchange for additional newly issued ADSs of Kitov. OrbiMed, Pontifax and Arkin Holdings will now each hold approximately 11% of Kitov’s shares on a non-diluted basis. “The closing of the FameWave acquisition and the addition of CM-24 to our emerging oncology pipeline is a significant milestone for our company and seamlessly aligns with our strategic focus on the development of differentiated oncology product candidates,” said Isaac Israel CEO of Kitov Pharma.  “CM-24 demonstrated encouraging signs of monotherapy anti-tumor activity in a successfully completed phase 1 trial, in addition to preclinical data that showed CM-24’s synergistic benefit with anti-PD(L)1s. This product candidate is an exciting addition to our pipeline, and we will concurrently continue to focus on advancing NT-219, our novel dual inhibitor of IRS 1/2 and STAT3, into a phase 1/2 trial for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, which we expect to commence in 2020.  In addition to acquiring this promising asset, this transaction also further strengthens our leadership team and product development capabilities, as we welcome Dr. Michael Schickler, FameWave’s CEO and pharmaceutical industry veteran, to Kitov.”Dr. Schickler will join Kitov Pharma as the Head of Clinical Operations and will lead the clinical development of CM-24 and NT-219.  “The initial clinical development work with the CM-24 program has suggested the antibody’s potential in overcoming the immune system exhaustion that mitigates the effectiveness and therapeutic duration of approved checkpoint inhibitors, and I am thrilled with Kitov’s commitment to advancing its development,” said Dr. Schickler.  “With manufacturing of the antibody well underway and having collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb on the phase 1/2 protocol, I look forward to the anticipated initiation of this study in the second half 2020.”This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

Story continuesAbout CM-24CM-24 is a clinical-stage monoclonal antibody blocking CEACAM1, a well-validated target which is highly expressed in many solid tumors as well as on immune cells and plays a pivotal role in the immune system by blocking immune cells’ access to tumors by CEACAM1-CEACAM1 and CEACAM1-CEACAM5 interaction. CEACAM1 was also shown to regulate TIM3 which induce immune fatigue. This unique mechanism of action positions CM-24 with a differentiated inhibitor of a multi-role immune checkpoint. In a monotherapy phase 1 study, CM-24 demonstrated safety and efficacy with standard dose in about 30% of patients.About Kitov PharmaKitov Pharma (Kitov Pharma Ltd.; NASDAQ/TASE: KTOV) is a clinical-stage company focusing on advancing first-in-class therapies to overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance, to create successful long-lasting treatments for people with cancer. Kitov’s oncology pipeline includes NT-219 and CM-24. NT-219 is a small molecule targeting the novel cancer drug resistance pathways IRS1/2 and STAT3. Kitov is currently advancing NT-219 in combination with cetuximab as a third-line or second-line treatment option for the treatment of recurrent and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head & neck cancer (SCCHN). CM-24 is a monoclonal antibody blocking CEACAM1, a novel immune checkpoint that supports tumor immune evasion and survival through multiple pathways. Kitov will advance CM-24 as a combination therapy with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Kitov has entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) for the planned Phase 1/2 clinical trials to evaluate the combination of CM-24 with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo®). Kitov is also the owner of Consensi™, a fixed-dose combination of celecoxib and amlodipine besylate, for the simultaneous treatment of osteoarthritis pain and hypertension which was approved by the FDA for marketing in the U.S in May 2018 and is expected to be launched in the U.S. by early 2020 by its partner Coeptis Pharmaceuticals. Kitov has also partnered to commercialize Consensi in China and South Korea. The company is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel.
