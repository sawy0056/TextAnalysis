But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Great Lakes Dredge & Dock (NASDAQ:GLDD). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. View our latest analysis for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock How Fast Is Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Growing Its Earnings Per Share?In a capitalist society capital chases profits, and that means share prices tend rise with earnings per share (EPS). So like the hint of a smile on a face that I love, growing EPS generally makes me look twice. It is therefore awe-striking that Great Lakes Dredge & Dock's EPS went from US$0.044 to US$0.72 in just one year. Even though that growth rate is unlikely to be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 9.3% to 14%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in my book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own Great Lakes Dredge & Dock shares worth a considerable sum. Indeed, they hold US$14m worth of its stock. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 1.9% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Does Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Great Lakes Dredge & Dock's earnings per share growth have been levitating higher, like a mountain goat scaling the Alps. That EPS growth certainly has my attention, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke my interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So to my mind Great Lakes Dredge & Dock is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies.
