We'll look at Floridienne S.A.'s (EBR:FLOB) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Floridienne has a price to earnings ratio of 22.12, based on the last twelve months. That means that at current prices, buyers pay €22.12 for every €1 in trailing yearly profits. Check out our latest analysis for Floridienne How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings

That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.How Does Floridienne's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio.

While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Floridienne increased earnings per share by a whopping 27% last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 104% per year over the last five years. I'd therefore be a little surprised if its P/E ratio was not relatively high.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does Floridienne's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Net debt is 37% of Floridienne's market cap. While that's enough to warrant consideration, it doesn't really concern us.The Verdict On Floridienne's P/E RatioFloridienne's P/E is 22.1 which is above average (17.3) in its market.
