But over the last half decade, the stock has not performed well. In fact, the share price is down 42%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund. View our latest analysis for MS Industrie While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, MS Industrie actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 47% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.We don't think that the 1.5% is big factor in the share price, since it's quite small, as dividends go. In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 4.0% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).XTRA:MSAG Income Statement, January 8th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how MS Industrie has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, MS Industrie's TSR for the last 5 years was -40%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in MS Industrie had a tough year, with a total loss of 23% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 20%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 9.7% per year over five years.
