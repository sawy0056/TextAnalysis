In addition to the strong top-line growth, we have also delivered year-over-year gross margin and adjusted EBITDA1 margin improvements of, respectively, 6.9 percentage points and 6.7 percentage points, mostly from continuous investments in automation and growing scale. This improvement has driven our consistent ability to generate positive cash flow from operating activities, which has in turn helped us grow our business and maintain a solid and stable cash position,” said Neil Cuggy, President and Chief Operating Officer of Goodfood.FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Financial highlights for the three-month periods ended November 30, 2019 and 2018:

Cash provided by operating activities 1,461   1,750   (289)   REVENUE AND GROSS MERCHANDISE SALES1Revenue for the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 increased by 90% to $56.3 million, compared to $29.6 million in the corresponding period of Fiscal 2019. Gross merchandise sales1 (“GMS”), rose 83% for the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 to reach $68.0 million, compared to $37.1 million for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. The increase in revenue and GMS1 was primarily driven by the continued growth in the number of active subscribers1, an increase in average order value and the expansion of our product offering to include private label grocery products, new meal solutions and expanded ready-to-cook plans. The increase in revenue has also been driven by a reduction of incentives and credits as a percentage of GMS1.The GMS run-rate1 was $276 million at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, compared to $226 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, surpassing its previous high of $257 million achieved in the third quarter of Fiscal 2019. This variance is explained by the continued growth of the business and by the first quarter being seasonally stronger than the fourth quarter of the year.The reconciliation of revenue to GMS1 for the three-month periods ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, is as follows: (Amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars – Unaudited)   Q1 2020   Q1 2019
Revenue $ 56,291 $ 29,617
Credits removed from cancelled accounts   -   -
Incentives and credits   11,745   7,488
Gross merchandise sales1 $ 68,036 $ 37,105   GROSS MARGIN AND ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN1The gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 increased substantially to 28.8%, compared to 21.9% for the corresponding period of Fiscal 2019. Adjusted gross margin1 was 41.1% for the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, compared to 37.7% for the corresponding period last year, an improvement of 3.4 percentage points. The increase in gross margin and adjusted gross margin1 resulted from lower production costs as a percentage of revenue and lower unit costs for food, packaging and shipping due to increased operational efficiencies, additional automation investments, increased density among the delivery zones and purchasing power with key suppliers, but also due to lower incentive and credits as a percentage of revenue. This was partially offset by the increase in our product offering, with our ready-to-cook meal solution presenting a higher gross margin at this stage than the new meal solutions and private label grocery products. The Company expects that fixed costs as a percentage of revenues will continue to decrease with Goodfood’s continued growth which should further increase gross margin and adjusted gross margin1 in the future.The reconciliation of adjusted gross profit1 and adjusted gross margin1 for the three-month periods ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, is as follows: (Amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars – Unaudited) Q1 2020   Q1 2019
Gross merchandise sales1 $ 68,036 $ 37,105
Cost of goods sold   40,072   23,123
Adjusted gross profit1 $ 27,964 $ 13,982
Adjusted gross margin1   41.1%   37.7%   ADJUSTED EBITDA1, NET LOSS AND NET LOSS PER SHARE Adjusted EBITDA margin1 improved by 6.7 percentage points in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020. The increase is primarily the result of higher revenues and operating leverage, lower production labour costs as a percentage of revenue, and lower unit costs with regards to food, packaging and shipping which generated a higher gross profit, offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses driven in large part by new salaried hires and the launch of new product offerings. Net loss for the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 was $5.2 million, or $0.09 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.09 per share (basic and diluted) for the corresponding period of Fiscal 2019. The increase in net loss was mainly attributable to factors explained above.Story continuesThe reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA1 and Adjusted EBITDA margin1 for the three-month periods ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, is as follows: (Amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars – Unaudited) Q1 2020   Q1 2019

Adjusted EBITDA margin1 (%)   (6.5%)     (13.2%)   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 amounted to $1.5 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $1.8 million for the same period last year, with the difference primarily due to a change in net working capital.In the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, the Company used its cash mainly for capital expenditures of $1.7 million for continued investments in automation. The Company still expects to spend between $10 million and $12 million in capital expenditures in Fiscal 2020.As at November 30, 2019, the Company had total debt of $14.5 million and $47.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.OUTLOOKThe online grocery industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. As a result, Goodfood believes that there are significant opportunities and advantages to rapidly grow its subscriber1 base by continuing to invest in increased household penetration through highly targeted marketing campaigns, in capacity expansion through additional facilities and investments in automation, and in increasing its product offering and in continuing to expand its national platform.Goodfood's strategy is in part to delay short-term profitability in order to invest in long-term shareholder value creation. Goodfood's strategy continues to focus on growing its subscriber1 base while investing in improving its cost structure to achieve its long-term margin goals. Growing Goodfood's subscriber1 base, market share, scale and product offerings will allow the Company to deliver greater value to its customers while attaining high returns on invested capital. As the Company grows its subscriber1 base, we are confident that Goodfood will achieve economies of scale and additional efficiencies which will lead to improvements in profitability while maintaining an unrivalled experience for subscribers1.CONFERENCE CALLGoodfood will hold a conference call to discuss these results on January 8, 2020, at 8:00AM Eastern Time.

The Company includes these measures because it believes they provide to certain investors a meaningful way of assessing financial performance. For a more complete description of these measures and a reconciliation of Goodfood's non-IFRS financial measures to financial results, please see Goodfood's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three-month period ended November 30, 2019.Goodfood's definition of the non-IFRS terms are as follows:Gross merchandise sales measure the total retail value of all goods sold by the Company before taking into account all incentives and credits.Gross merchandise sales run-rate is defined as gross merchandise sales for the four-week period ended as at the date indicated multiplied by thirteen. Management believes that gross merchandise sales run-rate is a useful measure of financial performance because it is indicative of gross merchandise sales on an annual basis for the Company's current level of active subscribers.Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross merchandise sales less cost of goods sold.Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by gross merchandise sales.EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before net finance expenses (income), depreciation and amortization expense and income tax expense.Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding share-based payments as they are an equity compensation item.Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.ACTIVE SUBSCRIBERSAn active subscriber is defined as an account that is scheduled to receive a delivery or has elected to skip delivery in the subsequent weekly delivery cycle. Active subscribers exclude cancelled accounts. For greater certainty, an active subscriber is only accounted for once, although different products might have been ordered in a given weekly delivery cycle. While active subscribers is not an IFRS or Non-IFRS Financial Measure, and therefore, does not appear in and cannot be reconciled to a specific line item in our financial statements, we believe that active subscribers is a useful metric for investors because it is indicative of future revenues. The Company reports the number of active subscribers at the beginning and end of the period, rounded to the nearest thousand.ABOUT GOODFOOD Goodfood (FOOD.TO) is a leading online grocery company in Canada, delivering fresh meal solutions and grocery items that make it easy for members from coast to coast to enjoy delicious meals at home every week.
