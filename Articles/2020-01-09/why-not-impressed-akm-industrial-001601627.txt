Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. How cyclical is AKM Industrial?

To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.AKM Industrial has total assets of HK$1.7b and current liabilities of HK$430m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 26% of its total assets.
