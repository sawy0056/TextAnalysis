(RIG) announced today that as the offshore drilling market continues to improve, the company is observing an increase in contract opportunities for its ultra-deepwater and harsh environment drilling services.“Customer demand for the highest specification ultra-deepwater floaters now equals or exceeds the number of marketable rigs currently available in many areas,” said Transocean President and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Thigpen. “As a result, new contracts more consistently reflect materially increased dayrates, which will generate significantly improved cash flow.”Since its last Fleet Status Report issued in October 2019, the company has secured an additional $352.9 million of contract backlog from new contracts and extensions to existing contracts, as follows: Rig Name                              Customer      Location          Duration/Days Dayrate                Backlog           Estimate            Contract         Date
