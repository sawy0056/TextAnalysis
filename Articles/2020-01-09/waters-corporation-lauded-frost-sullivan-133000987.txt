It identifies and resolves issues quickly and enables users to independently analyze and resume their experiments," said Janani Balasundar Industry Analyst. "The system is integrated with a high-performance electrospray ionization source with a plug-and-play probe, offering high levels of reproducibility for consistent performance. Consumables, including columns, biopharma-relevant test standards, and vials specific to each application are available with the system to ensure quality results."Significantly, Waters' UNIFI Scientific Information System, provided with the BioAccord system, can merge LC and high-performance MS into a single solution that incorporates data acquisition, processing, visualization, reporting, and configurable compliance tools within a networked laboratory environment. By having all parts of the process in one package, the software itself tracks and leads the workflow process. The system includes a fully integrated ACQUITY UPLC I-Class PLUS System and UNIFI software, which maximize the sensitivity and resolution of customers' methods, while enhancing both sample characterization and productivity.The system features columns specifically designed and tested for critical biopharma applications, including, but not limited to peptide mapping, intact mass, oligonucleotide and glycan analysis. Additional benefits include a binary solvent manager, ultra-low system dispersion, flexible sample support, and gradient smart-start options."Overall, Waters Corporation's outstanding customer service, footprint in 35 countries, including 15 manufacturing facilities, and customer-centricity have positioned it ideally for continued success in the global biopharmaceutical analytical instrumentation market," noted Janani.Each year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has developed an innovative element in a product by leveraging leading-edge technologies.
