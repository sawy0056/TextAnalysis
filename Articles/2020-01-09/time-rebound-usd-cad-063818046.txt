Both of these invalidations are bullish signs.Additionally, the current position of the daily indicators suggests that further improvement is just around the corner. Should this be the case and USD/CAD extends gains from here, the initial upside target will be the previously broken black line – that is the neck line of the head and shoulders formation.Taking all the above into account, opening long positions is justified from the risk/reward perspective.
