In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for SIG:0.036 = UK£34m ÷ (UK£1.6b - UK£658m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, SIG has an ROCE of 3.6%.

What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for SIG.Do SIG's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Current liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.SIG has total liabilities of UK£658m and total assets of UK£1.6b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 41% of its total assets. SIG's middling level of current liabilities have the effect of boosting its ROCE a bit.Our Take On SIG's ROCEDespite this, its ROCE is still mediocre, and you may find more appealing investments elsewhere.
