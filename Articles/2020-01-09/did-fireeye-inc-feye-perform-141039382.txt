They generate significant returns for investors to justify their large fees and they allocate a lot of time and employ complex research processes to determine the best stocks to invest in. A particularly interesting group of stocks that hedge funds like is the small-caps. The huge amount of capital does not allow hedge funds to invest a lot in small-caps, but our research showed that their most popular small-cap ideas are less efficiently priced and generate stronger returns than their large- and mega-cap picks and the broader market. That is why we pay special attention to the hedge fund activity in the small-cap space. Nevertheless, it is also possible to find underpriced large-cap stocks by following the hedge funds' moves. In this article, we look at what those funds think of FireEye Inc (NASDAQ:FEYE) based on that data.FireEye Inc (NASDAQ:FEYE) shares haven't seen a lot of action during the third quarter. Overall, hedge fund sentiment was unchanged. The stock was in 29 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2019. At the end of this article we will also compare FEYE to other stocks including Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. (NASDAQ:COKE), QTS Realty Trust Inc (NYSE:QTS), and Moog Inc (NYSE:MOG) to get a better sense of its popularity.In the 21st century investor’s toolkit there are numerous formulas shareholders put to use to value their holdings.

Intriguingly, Anand Parekh's Alyeska Investment Group cut the largest stake of the "upper crust" of funds watched by Insider Monkey, valued at an estimated $50.9 million in stock, and Cynthia Paul's Lynrock Lake was right behind this move, as the fund said goodbye to about $16 million worth. These transactions are important to note, as total hedge fund interest stayed the same (this is a bearish signal in our experience).Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as FireEye Inc (NASDAQ:FEYE) but similarly valued.
