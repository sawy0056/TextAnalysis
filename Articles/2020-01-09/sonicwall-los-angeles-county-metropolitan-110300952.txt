"It is imperative, now more than ever, that businesses use a layered security approach that doesn't add more surface space for attackers to take aim. Ensuring that communications and traffic are secure is a great starting point when building out a robust security network."Designed for a multi-cloud world, CAS applies an API-based architecture to deliver a much-needed layer of protection for organizations moving to the cloud, whether partially or completely, or using multiple SaaS services. The SonicWall solution protects popular enterprise SaaS email, collaboration and productivity applications including Office 365 email, SharePoint, OneDrive, G Suite, Dropbox and Box. Protection capabilities include advanced email security, data loss prevention (DLP), account takeover (ATO) protection, advanced malware and zero-day threat prevention, and other advanced security capabilities."Security is a large initiative for LA Metro, as we continue to grow our network and infrastructure to meet our growing needs that support those living, working and exploring LA County," said Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Senior Director of Engineering Richard Bezjian. "Our existing email protection would simply not be enough on its own to deliver the strength of protection required to identify and stop today's cyberattacks. SonicWall delivers additional security efficacy with a competitive TCO."CAS can be operational in mere minutes, eliminating expenses, installation and maintenance. It leverages the SonicWall Capture Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) cloud sandbox, the only advanced threat detection offering that combines multi-layer sandboxing to analyze suspicious attachments and URLs within emails.About MetroThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) is building the most ambitious transportation infrastructure program in the United States and is working to greatly improve mobility through its Vision 2028 Plan.
