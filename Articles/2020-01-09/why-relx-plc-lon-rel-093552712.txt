With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand RELX PLC (LON:REL).Our data shows RELX has a return on equity of 68% for the last year. That means that for every £1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated £0.68 in profit. See our latest analysis for RELX How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for RELX:68% = UK£1.5b ÷ UK£2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Mean?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. A higher profit will lead to a higher ROE. So, all else being equal, a high ROE is better than a low one. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does RELX Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, RELX has a higher ROE than the average (13%) in the Professional Services industry.LSE:REL Past Revenue and Net Income, January 8th 2020MoreThat is a good sign. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example, I often check if insiders have been buying shares.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining RELX's Debt And Its 68% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the significant use of debt by RELX, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.92. I think the ROE is impressive, but it would have been assisted by the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Story continuesIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss thisfree list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
