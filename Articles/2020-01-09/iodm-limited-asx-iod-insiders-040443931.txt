The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in IODM Limited (ASX:IOD).What Is Insider Selling?It is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.We don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise. Check out our latest analysis for IODM The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At IODMNon-Executive Director Anthony Smith made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$228k worth of shares at a price of AU$0.085 each. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (AU$0.14), we still think insider buying is a positive. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 7.89m shares worth AU$527k. But they sold 11034715 for AU$452k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by IODM insiders. The average buy price was around AU$0.067. We don't deny that it is nice to see insiders buying stock in the company. However, you should keep in mind that they bought when the share price was meaningfully below today's levels.

In that period Non-Executive Director Anthony Smith spent AU$125k on shares. On the other hand, Non-Executive Director Anthony Smith sold AU$60k worth of shares. While it's good to see the insider buying, the net amount bought isn't enough for us to gain much confidence from it.Does IODM Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that IODM insiders own 38% of the company, worth about AU$27m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At IODM Tell Us?The recent insider purchase is heartening. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of IODM we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.
