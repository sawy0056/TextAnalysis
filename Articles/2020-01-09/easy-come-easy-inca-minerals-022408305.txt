It hits us in the gut when we see fellow investors suffer a loss. For example, we sympathize with anyone who was caught holding Inca Minerals Limited (ASX:ICG) during the five years that saw its share price drop a whopping 92%. And it's not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 63% in the last year.We really feel for shareholders in this scenario. It's a good reminder of the importance of diversification, and it's worth keeping in mind there's more to life than money, anyway. Check out our latest analysis for Inca Minerals We don't think Inca Minerals's revenue of AU$279,333 is enough to establish significant demand. We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. It seems likely some shareholders believe that Inca Minerals will find or develop a valuable new mine before too long.Companies that lack both meaningful revenue and profits are usually considered high risk. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt. Some Inca Minerals investors have already had a taste of the bitterness stocks like this can leave in the mouth.Inca Minerals had liabilities exceeding cash by AU$627k when it last reported in June 2019, according to our data. That makes it extremely high risk, in our view. But with the share price diving 39% per year, over 5 years , it's probably fair to say that some shareholders no longer believe the company will succeed.

There's no way to know its value easily. What if insiders are ditching the stock hand over fist? It would bother me, that's for sure. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?Investors should note that there's a difference between Inca Minerals's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Inca Minerals hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of -90% exceeds its share price return of -92%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Inca Minerals had a tough year, with a total loss of 60%, against a market gain of about 24%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 37% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. If you would like to research Inca Minerals in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.Story continuesIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.
