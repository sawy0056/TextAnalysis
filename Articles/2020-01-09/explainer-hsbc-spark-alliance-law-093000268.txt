The account is said to be linked to Spark Alliance HK, which raises money from crowdfunding to help grease the wheel of protests since 2016. It also posted bail for protesters arrested during the opposition to the ill-fated extradition bill for much of last year, according to its Facebook page.On the eve of Christmas, HSBC's branch in Mong Kok was smashed while facilities on Hennessy Road outlet were damaged as the city ushered in the new year. Even a pair of iconic pre-war lion sculptures were not spared. All told, almost a dozen branches belonging to HSBC and its majority-owned Hang Seng Bank were put out of action for several days.The banking group has distanced itself from any linkages that its decision to close the account was tied to a crackdown by the Hong Kong police and the force's move to freeze about HK$70 million (US$9 million) of its funds.View photosOne of the bronze lions outside the HSBC headquarters in Central was vandalised during an anti-government rally on January 1.

A breach may entail a reprimand and a fine of up to HK$10 million.What banks, brokers, accountants or other relevant bodies need to do under this lawCustomers due diligence is an important part of what these financial and transaction agents need to do under the ordinance, according to Kenneth Leung Kai-cheong, a lawmaker for accountancy sector.Story continues"When a customer opens a bank account, the bank needs to check his/her background and the sources of funding," he said. "Likewise, when an accountant or a lawyer sets up a trust account, they need to conduct the same check to ensure the funds are not related to any illegal activities."Once the accounts are established, banks, brokers or accountants need to do follow-up checks to ensure that the accounts and their purposes have not changed in nature, as well as to screen for any potential suspicious transactions.Man arrested as HSBC cheque deposit machine is smashed in Hong Kong branchWhat banks or other institutions do when they see suspicious transactionsBanks are required to submit a suspicious transaction report to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit, which is jointly run by the police and the Customs & Excise Department, if they have any reason to suspect money laundering or fraud."We do not take the decision to close any account lightly," HSBC said in an email reply on December 29. "As an international bank, the decision to close the account is in accordance with global regulatory standards."How do banks conduct due diligence process on customers?HSBC Hong Kong's chief executive Diana Cesar in a media briefing in 2017 explained how the bank conducted the regular due diligence under the anti-money laundering regulation.For the retail customers, the bank conducts regular checks every few years, and requires retail customers to disclose how their accounts are used, she said then. These are in addition to requiring them to furnish their addresses, contact details, employment and income history.Corporate clients must provide information with supporting documents on the nature of their business, ownership data, the jurisdiction of their operations, source of funding and the purpose of the account.What stockbrokers need to do under the Ordinance"Stockbrokers also need to check the background of their customers to make sure their sources of funding do not come from any illegal activities," said Gordon Tsui, chairman of Hong Kong Securities Association. "If we find any suspicious transaction, we need to make a report to the police."All of the city's 600-odd brokerages are also not allowed to accept cash as payment for stock purchases or for investment products, he added. These transactions must be settled via bank transfers or cheques.Can a company account be used to pay for personal insurance policies?"In general, if it is a company bank account, then the account should be used for corporate transactions," said Leung, the lawmaker for the accountancy sector."The company can buy policies for business use such as credit insurance or property insurance. If anyone uses a corporate account to buy personal insurance products, that would be considered as suspicious and not advisable," he said.HSBC, in an education booklet, also advises small and medium-sized enterprises to not use their corporate accounts for personal transactions.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
