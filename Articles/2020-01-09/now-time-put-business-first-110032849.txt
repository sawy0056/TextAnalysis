But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Business First Bancshares (NASDAQ:BFST). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. View our latest analysis for Business First Bancshares Business First Bancshares's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. As a tree reaches steadily for the sky, Business First Bancshares's EPS has grown 36% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of Business First Bancshares's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note Business First Bancshares's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 41% to US$84m. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own Business First Bancshares shares worth a considerable sum. To be specific, they have US$16m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 4.9% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalizations between US$200m and US$800m, like Business First Bancshares, the median CEO pay is around US$1.7m.The Business First Bancshares CEO received US$1m in compensation for the year ending December 2018. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given its below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Story continuesShould You Add Business First Bancshares To Your Watchlist?For growth investors like me, Business First Bancshares's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. Each to their own, but I think all this makes Business First Bancshares look rather interesting indeed. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Business First Bancshares by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.Although Business First Bancshares certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
