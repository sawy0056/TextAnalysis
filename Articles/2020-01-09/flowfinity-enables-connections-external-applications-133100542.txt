This dynamic data structure can drive the whole organization, whether hosted securely in the cloud or an on-premises server installation.The resulting unified systems feature complete workflow processes that span multiple applications, all connected to provide a seamless experience for end users and more reliable data integrity for managers and admins.   Without adequate integration to enable these streamlined connections, organizations often end up with a collection of disconnected software systems that are confusing to use. This can lead to errors, data bottlenecks and process inefficiencies."Integration allows organizations to unify disparate systems and workflows," said Larry Wilson, VP Sales & Marketing, Flowfinity.
