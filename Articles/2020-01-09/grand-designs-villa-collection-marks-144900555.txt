Wood and stone-clad interiors are meticulously finished with rattan bamboo furniture, woven Sumba textiles and handmade woodcarvings from Bali and Java, giving guests a flavour of Bali's rich history of design and creativity."We have made tremendous efforts to showcase Indonesian heritage in the eyes of the world by incorporating the best local craftsmanship, philosophy and materials into the interior design," said Rudy Dodo, founder of Jakarta-based Trivium Design Group, which is responsible for interiors throughout the resort.Private KingdomsNamed after the kingdom that ruled from east Java in the 13th-Century, Singhasari One-Bedroom Villas offer a generous 202 sq m of living space that's perfect for couples, with a private pool and terrace on the ground floor and a king-sized bedroom and outdoor rain shower upstairs.Sriwijaya Two-Bedroom Villas range from 200 to 460 sq m, with an additional twin bedroom and a rooftop lounge and dining area, while the Majapahit Three-Bedroom Villas open out onto their own tropical gardens, with private kitchens, spacious outdoor living area and room for six adults and three children to sleep, ranging from 637 to 891 sq m. Set at the water's edge adjacent to the Apurva Wedding Chapel, the three-bedroom Nusantara Presidential Villa is the jewel in the resort's collection, with 1,379 sq m of indoor-outdoor space.
