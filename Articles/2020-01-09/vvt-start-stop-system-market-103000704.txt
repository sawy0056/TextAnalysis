In a gasoline engine, the fuel is mixed with air prior to its entrance into the engine cylinder. The fuel–air mixture is controlled by a valve in the gasoline VVT system. The duration and timing of the fuel–air mixture entrance are controlled by the inlet valve. Motor enthusiasts generally prefer gasoline engine vehicles over diesel engine vehicles due to the added performance advantages. Diesel engines are better in terms of economies of scale but lag in performance because of their low power and torque output. Also, particulate emissions in gasoline vehicles are less. Hence, the demand for gasoline vehicles increases worldwide as they comply with emission norms.Cam-phasing plus changing is expected to be the fastest VVT system market  The adoption of Cam-phasing plus changing system is estimated to be higher in Asia Pacific and North America owing to the increase in performance-focused fuel efficient vehicles and stringent emissions regulations. The market for VVT systems is estimated to further increase with the rising production levels of automobiles incorporated with these advanced technologies. Europe is projected to witness moderate growth for VVT systems due to the saturation of VVT technology in countries such as Germany, France, and Spain. The high rate of technological adoption in regions like China, India, and South Korea is also a driving factor for the growth of these systems in the Asia Pacific region. Request FREE Sample Report: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=1206Asia Pacific is expected to be the largest market during the forecast periodAsia Pacific is the largest market for VVT & start-stop system systems because of the increasing automotive production in Japan, China, and India.
