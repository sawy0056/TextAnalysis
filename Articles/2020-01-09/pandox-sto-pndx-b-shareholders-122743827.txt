But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, Pandox AB (publ) (STO:PNDX B) shareholders have seen the share price rise 52% over three years, well in excess of the market return (18%, not including dividends). Check out our latest analysis for Pandox In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the three years of share price growth, Pandox actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 2.6% per year.Companies are not always focussed on EPS growth in the short term, and looking at how the share price has reacted, we don't think EPS is the most important metric for Pandox at the moment. Therefore, it makes sense to look into other metrics.It may well be that Pandox revenue growth rate of 13% over three years has convinced shareholders to believe in a brighter future. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth, and maybe shareholder's faith in better days ahead will be rewarded.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).OM:PNDX B Income Statement, January 8th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Pandox's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Pandox, it has a TSR of 66% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Pandox shareholders have gained 47% (in total) over the last year. That includes the value of the dividend. That gain actually surpasses the 18% TSR it generated (per year) over three years. The improving returns to shareholders suggests the stock is becoming more popular with time.
