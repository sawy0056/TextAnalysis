All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for IMAX China Holding:0.20 = US$56m ÷ (US$342m - US$66m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, IMAX China Holding has an ROCE of 20%.

Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.IMAX China Holding has total assets of US$342m and current liabilities of US$66m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 19% of its total assets. This is quite a low level of current liabilities which would not greatly boost the already high ROCE.What We Can Learn From IMAX China Holding's ROCE, IMAX China Holding looks strong on this analysis,
