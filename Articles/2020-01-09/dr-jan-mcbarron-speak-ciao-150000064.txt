Recognizing that nurses often had more personal, meaningful interactions with patients compared to the doctors, Dr. McBarron decided to become a doctor herself and change the typical less personal doctor-patient relationship.After earning her M.D., Dr. McBarron spent the next three decades specializing in Medical Bariatrics, otherwise known as non-surgical weight loss. Having struggled with her own issues regarding weight and ultimately losing upwards of 50lbs, Dr. Jan McBarron was able to connect more deeply with her patients and provide a more personal and effective experience.Although her time as a practicing physician in the field of medical bariatrics was fulfilling and enjoyable, Dr. Jan McBarron recently decided to stop seeing patients and instead focus on reaching larger numbers of people through her speaking events, written work, and social media presence.For more information on Dr. Jan McBarron or her recently launched Charitable Campaign efforts (Duke and The Doctor Charity), please visit: https://dukeandthedoctorcharity.com.Contact:Jan McBarron MDinfo@drjanmcbarron.comSOURCE: Dr. Jan McBarronView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/572426/Dr-Jan-McBarron-to-Speak-at-Ciao-Bella-LuncheonReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
