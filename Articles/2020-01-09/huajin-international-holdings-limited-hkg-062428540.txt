To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Huajin International Holdings:0.092 = CN¥59m ÷ (CN¥1.7b - CN¥1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Huajin International Holdings has an ROCE of 9.2%.

Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Huajin International Holdings has total liabilities of CN¥1.1b and total assets of CN¥1.7b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 62% of its total assets. Huajin International Holdings has a fairly high level of current liabilities, meaningfully impacting its ROCE.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Huajin International Holdings's ROCENotably, it also has a mediocre ROCE, which to my mind is not an appealing combination.
