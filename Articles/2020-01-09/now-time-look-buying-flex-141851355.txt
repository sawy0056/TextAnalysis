(NASDAQ:FLEX)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosFlex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX), which is in the electronic business, and is based in Singapore, saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Flex’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Flex What's the opportunity in Flex?Good news, investors! Flex is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $24.97, but it is currently trading at US$12.53 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Flex’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Flex generate?NasdaqGS:FLEX Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted revenue growth of 2.0% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Flex, at least in the short term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since FLEX is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor?
