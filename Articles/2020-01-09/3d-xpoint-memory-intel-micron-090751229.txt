Both companies have since introduced support for this technology, Intel with its Optane brand of SSDs and DIMMs, and Micron with its QuantX products. Yet, very little 3D XPoint product is shipping.What is this technology? Why have these companies brought it to the market? Why is it taking so long to grow?This report is an in-depth evaluation of the new Intel-Micron 3D XPoint memory. It explains why and how crosspoint memories work and the manufacturing challenges they present while examining the market and its impact on computing and its competition.In this detailed study the analyst not only explains why and how 3D XPoint memory has been introduced, but it explores its market impact and how it will change the memory business for memory makers, OEMs, and end-users. This study examines the new memory's technology and its place in the memory/storage hierarchy.Key Topics Covered: What Is 3D XPoint Memory?
