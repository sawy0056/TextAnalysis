This means they could return to looking at the fundamentals surrounding individual stocks. With this in mind, here are some companies which are likely to be in focus today.Boeing Co (NYSE:BA). Shares in the airplane manufacturer were hit pre-market by news that a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 airliner crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people aboard in a crash that an initial report blamed on engine failure. A spokesman for the manufacturer said it was gathering more information.Walgreens Boots (NASDAQ:WBA). The drugstore’s first-quarter results came in well short of Wall Street expectations, with its adjusted earnings per share at $1.37 lower than the $1.41 expected by analysts, on average. These figures were hurt by lower payments from insurers on drugs sold.Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Shares in the automotive and energy company have climbed pre-market after rivals Daimler and BMW, through their joint-venture Free Now, a mobility ride-hailing app in Europe, decided to order 60 Tesla vehicles in order to expand their electric vehicle offering in Germany.Beyond Meat Inc (NASDAQ:BYND) Shares in the retailer soared in pre-market trading after the retailer of plant-based burgers said its talks to supply McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) well “going well”. This contrasts with rival Impossible Foods who said it did not have the capacity to supply the quantity needed by the burger giant.Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA) Shares of the oil and gas company soared after it announced a “significant oil discovery” off the coast of Suriname. This could alter the stock investment thesis around the company, and resulted in it becoming the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 index.Related ArticlesSaudi Arabia stocks lower at close of trade; Tadawul All Share down 0.91%Walgreens profit misses estimates on pharmacy weakness, shares fall 6%Goldman Sachs Says 2020 Could Be Good Year for U.K. Stock MarketReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBoeing airplanes boss earns big stock award after strong launch of new divisionAmerican City Business JournalsP&G veteran tapped for C-suite at BoeingAmerican City Business JournalsGovernment leaders talk layoff response and building Wichita’s future to Emerging LeadersAmerican City Business JournalsCanada mulling made-in-Ottawa supplement to Boeing's 737 MAX flight manualReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
