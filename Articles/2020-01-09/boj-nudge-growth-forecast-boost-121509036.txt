But analysts say the boost could be smaller and may not come quickly as a tight labour market delays public works projects.While the situation in the Middle East has emerged as a new risk, the BOJ is likely to maintain its view that Japan's economy will continue to expand moderately, the sources said.BOJ officials hope robust capital spending and some bright signs in the global economy, such as a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, will underpin growth.But some officials fret that soft global demand for cars and machinery - goods where Japanese firms are competitive - could keep any rebound in January-March growth weak, the sources said.The BOJ board will also review its current forecasts for core consumer inflation to hit 1.1% in fiscal 2020 and to accelerate to 1.5% the following year.While rising energy costs and the boost from the fiscal package could offer some lift to inflation, the BOJ is unlikely to make big changes to the current projection, the sources said.Projections of tame inflation will reinforce market expectations that the BOJ will keep monetary policy ultra-loose to achieve its elusive 2% price goal, analysts say.(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Additional reporting by Takahiko Wada; Editing by Hugh Lawson)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIndependent media in the firing line in CubaAFPFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergJapan scrambles for workarounds after Abe urges March school shutdown to stem coronavirusReutersAt least 7 Iranian government officials have coronavirusThe WeekJapan school closure plan stuns parents, officialsAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
