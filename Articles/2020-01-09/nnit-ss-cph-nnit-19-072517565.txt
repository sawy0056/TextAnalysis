This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand NNIT A/S (CPH:NNIT).NNIT has a ROE of 19%, based on the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each DKK1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made DKK0.19 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for NNIT How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for NNIT:19% = ø209m ÷ ø1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does NNIT Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. The image below shows that NNIT has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Healthcare Services industry average (19%).CPSE:NNIT Past Revenue and Net Income, January 8th 2020MoreThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. ROE tells us about the quality of the business, but it does not give us much of an idea if the share price is cheap.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.NNIT's Debt And Its 19% ROEWhile NNIT does have some debt, with debt to equity of just 0.45, we wouldn't say debt is excessive. The fact that it achieved a fairly good ROE with only modest debt suggests the business might be worth putting on your watchlist. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises.But It's Just One MetricReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Story continuesOf course NNIT may not be the best stock to buy.
