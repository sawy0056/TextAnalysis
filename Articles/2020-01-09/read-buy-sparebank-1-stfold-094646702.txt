We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to SpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus's (OB:SOAG), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is SpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus's P/E ratio?

Check out our latest analysis for SpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings

All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does SpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (8.6) for companies in the banks industry is higher than SpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus's P/E.OB:SOAG Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreSpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.SpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus increased earnings per share by 6.1% last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 4.2% per year over the last five years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does SpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus's Balance Sheet Tell Us?SpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus's net debt is considerable, at 164% of its market cap. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you must keep in mind that these debt levels would usually warrant a relatively low P/E.The Verdict On SpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus's P/E RatioSpareBank 1 Østfold Akershus trades on a P/E ratio of 7.9, which is below the NO market average of 14.0. It's good to see EPS growth in the last 12 months, but the debt on the balance sheet might be muting expectations.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
