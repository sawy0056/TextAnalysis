Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Johnson Electric Holdings:0.06 = US$209m ÷ (US$4.3b - US$848m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, Johnson Electric Holdings has an ROCE of 6.0%.

The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Johnson Electric Holdings has total assets of US$4.3b and current liabilities of US$848m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 20% of its total assets. This very reasonable level of current liabilities would not boost the ROCE by much.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Johnson Electric Holdings's ROCEWith that in mind, we're not overly impressed with Johnson Electric Holdings's ROCE, so it may not be the most appealing prospect.
