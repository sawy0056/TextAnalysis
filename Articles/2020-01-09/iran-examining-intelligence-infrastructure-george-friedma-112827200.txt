Not that there was the attack, but that the Iranians seem to be penetrated.”The Department of Homeland Security has warned that Iran has a history of cybercrime, causing defense and intelligence officials to brace for the possibility of a counter attack. Last week, a group claiming to be Iranian hackers broke into a federal government library website, but the FBI has not confirmed the hack to be legitimate. “I don't really see [cyber hacks] as a response,” Friedman says. “A normal response for Iranian intelligence is two things: One, they wait quite a while before carrying out their response, and two, they attack on a populated area, trying to cause as many casualties as possible.”The Trump administration says it is clear that Soleimani was building a network to potentially attack Americans. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doubled down on the decision on Tuesday, saying the Department of Defense “got it right.”U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attends a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., January 7, 2020.

But Friedman says Iran is not equipped for such an attack.“[The] Iranians do not have the ability to wage war against the United States,” Friedman says. “If they were to get into an air war, the United States would very quickly eliminate them.”Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLate-Night Hosts Cough All Over Trump’s ‘Ludicrous’ Coronavirus Attack PlanHuffPostAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPCycling race canceled with 2 virus cases, Froome quarantinedThe Associated PressBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
