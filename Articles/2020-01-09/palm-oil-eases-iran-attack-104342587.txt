Dalian's most-active soyoil contract rose 2.4%, while its palm oil contract also gained 1%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade slid 0.6%.Palm oil is affected by price movements in related oils as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oils market.(Reporting by Mei Mei Chu; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Amy Caren Daniel)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIndonesian government plans to raise palm oil export levy - ministerReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
