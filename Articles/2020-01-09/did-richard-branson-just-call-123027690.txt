The photo was then used by Weeks to ‘endorse’ the alleged scam.Branson’s image, like many other celebrity business people, has been used by fraudsters across the internet for years – often with a battered and bruised face from a bike accident in 2016.Scammers play on the good reputation of successful and well-respected entrepreneurs in a bid to lure people into believing a scheme is being backed by someone they trust.However, Branson himself is now spearheading a campaign to tackle fraud head-on with his videos.Before apparently slamming Bitcoin, the twice-married magnate and adventurist urges people not to respond to social media messages or investment opportunities that feature his name and image.“Even if it’s a verified account with a blue tick, know that I never direct message anyone – nor does any of my team,” he says.“At Virgin, we’re working hard to unmask scammers.“Only trust what we post on our official channels. Help us stop scammers and report anything you think is suspicious. If you think it’s a con, send it on.” Victim of OneCoin scam longs for the day that missing Cryptoqueen will be found…
