Headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, Evolve is a leading adolescent behavioral health services provider, specializing in mental health, trauma, and substance abuse for adolescents in need. Evolve’s mission is to transform the teen mental health space, ensuring that teens and their families have the highest level of compassionate care available.“We are excited about the prospect of building upon Evolve’s excellent clinical programs as we continue to provide the highest quality teen mental health treatment,” said David Jahns, Managing Director at Galen Partners. “The dramatic increase in adolescent anxiety, suicide, and other mental health disorders represent a public health crisis, illustrated by a 400% increase nationally in adolescent suicide attempts since 2011. Despite the clear need for behavioral health care for the adolescent patient population, there remains a shortage of providers and care models focused on serving these patients. Galen believes Evolve is particularly well suited to meet this overwhelming unmet need through its clinically-validated treatment approach, and we look forward to expanding the Evolve platform so that troubled adolescents can get the care they need.”Ken Wood, Evolve’s CEO, stated, “We are proud of Evolve’s history of delivering quality patient care through our best-in-class treatment centers, highly trained and knowledgeable staff, evidence-based treatment approach, and a company culture centered on teamwork and integrity. On behalf of the entire Evolve team, we are excited about our partnership with Galen, and we know Evolve will accomplish even greater things with their backing and support.”The Galen partnership enables Evolve to further expand its Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) and Joint Commission-accredited, evidence-based and highly impactful mental-health services for teens and their families.About Galen PartnersFounded in 1990, Galen Partners is a leading healthcare-focused growth equity investment firm.
