To "hole"-heartedly thank fans for their devotion to Thomas', the brand will be hiding a coveted orange ticket in one free bagel in every city, redeemable for a smart watch. To make the search even more exciting, in one randomly selected city, a golden ticket will hold a grand prize that will have one lucky fan savoring delicious moments all year long thanks to a $2,500 grocery shopping spree."Bagels are a delicious and treasured member of the Thomas' family so we couldn't think of a better way to kick off our year-long, 140th anniversary than with a nationwide celebration of National Bagel Day," said Eduardo Zarate, Senior Director of Marketing for Thomas'. "Fans loved our pop-up celebration in Philadelphia last year, so we're excited to bring together bagel fans from all across the country in 2020 as we 'toast' to this iconic classic on January 15th!"To really keep things "toasty" for everyone this winter season, Thomas' has also partnered with Operation Warm to make a $100,000 donation of 7,500 coats nationwide.
