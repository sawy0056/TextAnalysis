Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.With only a three-year payment history, and a 1.4% yield, investors probably think CMC Markets is not much of a dividend stock. While it may not look like much, if earnings are growing it could become quite interesting. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding CMC Markets for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis LSE:CMCX Historical Dividend Yield, January 8th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, CMC Markets paid out 40% of its profit as dividends. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.Consider getting
our latest analysis on CMC Markets's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. This company's dividend has been unstable, and with a relatively short history, we think it's a little soon to draw strong conclusions about its long term dividend potential. During the past three-year period, the first annual payment was UK£0.11 in 2017, compared to UK£0.02 last year. This works out to a decline of approximately 81% over that time.We struggle to make a case for buying CMC Markets for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past three years.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, and a poor history of shrinking dividends, it's even more important to see if EPS are growing. CMC Markets's earnings per share have been essentially flat over the past five years. Over the long term, steady earnings per share is a risk as the value of the dividends can be reduced by inflation. A payout ratio below 50% leaves ample room to reinvest in the business, and provides finanical flexibility. However, earnings per share are unfortunately not growing much. Might this suggest that the company should pay a higher dividend instead?ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. We're glad to see CMC Markets has a low payout ratio, as this suggests earnings are being reinvested in the business. Second, earnings have been essentially flat, and its history of dividend payments is chequered - having cut its dividend at least once in the past. In summary, we're unenthused by CMC Markets as a dividend stock. It's not that we think it is a bad company; it simply falls short of our criteria in some key areas.Story continuesEarnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
