That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.How Does Miricor Enterprises Holdings's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. As you can see below, Miricor Enterprises Holdings has a higher P/E than the average company (14.4) in the consumer services industry.SEHK:1827 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Miricor Enterprises Holdings shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.Miricor Enterprises Holdings saw earnings per share decrease by 9.3% last year. And over the longer term (3 years) earnings per share have decreased 4.3% annually. So we might expect a relatively low P/E.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Miricor Enterprises Holdings's Balance SheetWith net cash of HK$137m, Miricor Enterprises Holdings has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 35% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On Miricor Enterprises Holdings's P/E RatioMiricor Enterprises Holdings's P/E is 18.1 which is above average (10.7) in its market. The recent drop in earnings per share might keep value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
