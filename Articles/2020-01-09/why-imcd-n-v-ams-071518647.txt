We'll show how you can use IMCD N.V.'s (AMS:IMCD) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. IMCD has a P/E ratio of 37.13, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 2.7%. View our latest analysis for IMCD How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for IMCD:P/E of 37.13 = €78.30 ÷ €2.11 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does IMCD Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. The image below shows that IMCD has a higher P/E than the average (15.2) P/E for companies in the trade distributors industry.ENXTAM:IMCD Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreIMCD's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Notably, IMCD grew EPS by a whopping 25% in the last year. And earnings per share have improved by 17% annually, over the last three years. With that performance, I would expect it to have an above average P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting IMCD's P/E?Net debt totals 17% of IMCD's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Verdict On IMCD's P/E RatioIMCD's P/E is 37.1 which is above average (20.7) in its market. Its debt levels do not imperil its balance sheet and it is growing EPS strongly. Therefore, it's not particularly surprising that it has a above average P/E ratio.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
