As a small cap stock, hardly covered by any analysts, there is generally more of an opportunity for mispricing as there is less activity to push the stock closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity here to buy? Let’s take a look at Pricer’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Pricer What's the opportunity in Pricer?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 11.00% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Pricer today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth SEK18.60, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Pricer’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Pricer look like?OM:PRIC B Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 24% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Pricer. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? PRIC B’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PRIC B, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
