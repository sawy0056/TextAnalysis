Air Burners, Inc.

The balance went into our already at-capacity landfills. So, where is this waste to go?  We need to eliminate as much of it as possible. Biomass Energy is a partial solution. However, traditional Biomass to Energy plants are not cost effective due to the significant preprocessing required.  Today's biomass to energy plants are very good at extracting energy from wood waste but that means their efficiency at eliminating the waste is very poor. They are solving an energy problem not a waste problem.  In today's world we need to solve the waste problem.  The new Air Burners PGFireBox® does exactly that, eliminate the waste at a significantly higher rate with less cost and less impact on our environment.We are excited to announce Air Burners' participation at the International Biomass Conference and Expo on February 3-5, 2020 at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee.  Join us at BOOTH #602 and, catch our President, Brian O'Connor at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, February 5th speaking about solutions to solve the wood and vegetative waste elimination problem while also producing electric and thermal energy.For the past 23 years, Air Burners has been the world leader in the design and manufacturing of Air Curtain Burners.  Air Burners, Inc. is located in Palm City, Florida.
