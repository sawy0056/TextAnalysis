It will increase the demand for advanced ART technologies and procedures. The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) stated that around 6.7% of women residing in the U.S. were affected by infertility in 2018. The age group was between 15 to 44 years. Moreover, it is not only the women who are suffering from infertility nowadays. The Oxford Journals published a study that mentioned that in the U.K., one out of ten men from the age group of 16 to 74 years is affected by infertility. The rate is rising worldwide owing to the increasing cases of obesity, rising stress level and a rapid inclination towards a sedentary lifestyle.  Besides, numerous government and non-profit agencies in the developed, as well as developing nations, are implementing awareness campaigns to educate the general populaces regarding the cost-effective fertility treatments. These are some of the crucial assisted reproductive technologies market trends that are set to augment ART market growth.Fresh Non-donor Segment to Lead Backed by High Success Rate of ProceduresBy procedure, the Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) Market is divided into fresh donor, frozen donor, fresh non-donor, and frozen non-donor. Amongst these, the fresh non-donor segment is expected to acquire a high CAGR in the coming years owing to the high success rate of procedures by utilizing fresh embryos or eggs.

The frozen non-donor segment, on the other hand, currently holds the second position owing to its cost-effective nature as compared to those cycles that use fresh embryos or eggs. The rest of the segments would also exhibit a healthy CAGR in the coming years.Story continuesRequest a Sample Copy of the Research Report: https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/enquiry/request-sample-pdf/assisted-reproductive-technology-art-market-101811Europe to Dominate: Increasing Prevalence of Fertility to Favor Growth The assisted reproductive technologies market is geographically segregated into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, and Latin America.
