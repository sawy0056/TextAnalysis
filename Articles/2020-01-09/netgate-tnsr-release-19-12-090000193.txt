TNSR is advanced firewall, router, and VPN software with breakthrough price-performance, management, and service expansion flexibility. Built on FD.io's Vector Packet Processing (VPP), of which Netgate is a leading contributor, TNSR delivers extraordinary packet processing performance in software. This enables enterprises and service providers to scale networks far less expensively than with legacy brand solutions.TNSR Release 19.12 expands deployment options, increases IPSec stream performance, and strengthens overall routing functionality. Notable features include: Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) – now an officially supported platform Multi-core IPSec – enables multiple encrypted streams, critical to scale up / scale out use cases including data center replication and Site-to-Site VPN Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with dynamic routing – identifies forwarding path failure(s), enabling rapid routing adjustments for OSPF and BGP networks Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) interface tracking – enables management of VRRP instance priorities based on the state of TNSR interfaces, thus ensuring traffic continues to flow through an available VRRP peer if an interface upstream of a VRRP instance goes down OSPFv3 (OSPF6) – enables OSPF for IPv6 RIPv2 – provides support for legacy routing use cases"Release 19.12 represents another significant step forward for our customers as they continue to build out high-speed routed networks," said Jim Thompson, Netgate CTO. "We are seeing rising demand for TNSR in vRouter and high-speed IPSec use cases. And, while cloud containers may dominate the world's networking headlines, traditional network function virtualization (NFV) is still our biggest deployment driver."TNSR is available for deployment on Netgate's SG-5100, XG-1537, XG-1541 appliances; as a bare metal image for non-Netgate appliances and virtual machines; as software instances on AWS and Microsoft Azure Marketplaces; and from AWS Solution Providers and Microsoft Azure partners.Contact sales@netgate.com to request a free trial version of the software.
