The global population is expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, according to the UN. Subsequently, food production must increase significantly as well. Artificial intelligence enables efficient and potential farming techniques for increased crop productivity and yield. For instance, the artificial intelligence Sowing App developed by Microsoft sends sowing advisories on the optimal date for crop sowing to farmers. It enhances the farmers' efficiency in terms of planting and forecasting weather conditions. The Asia Pacific market is expected to witness substantial growth over the forecast period, owing to increasing adoption of artificial intelligence -enabled solutions and services by agriculture-technology-based companies in emerging economies. Emerging economies such as India and China have started implementing artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning and computer vision to increase crop yield. Favorable regulations and standards in these countries encourage the implementation of modern techniques in farming and agriculture. For instance, in July 2019, the government of India began the use of artificial intelligence for yield estimation and crop cutting to cut down the cost of farming and increase productivity.Grand View Research has segmented the global artificial intelligence in agriculture market based on component, technology, application, and region:Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture Component Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2014 - 2025) Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture Technology Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2014 - 2025) Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture Application Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2014 - 2025) Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture Regional Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2014 - 2025) Find more research reports on Next Generation Technologies Industry, by Grand View Research:Quantum Computing Market – This concept is highly driven by the yearning to escalate the capability of simulating and modeling complex data, advance the optimization and efficiency of systems or processes, and analyze problems with further precision. 4K Display Market – High definition has been a significant trend in smart devices and provides an improvement to viewing experience.
