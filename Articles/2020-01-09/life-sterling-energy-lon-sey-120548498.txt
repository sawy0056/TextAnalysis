But along the way some stocks are going to perform badly. To wit, the Sterling Energy plc (LON:SEY) share price managed to fall 57% over five long years. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 23%. There was little comfort for shareholders in the last week as the price declined a further 2.0%. View our latest analysis for Sterling Energy Sterling Energy didn't have any revenue in the last year, so it's fair to say it doesn't yet have a proven product (or at least not one people are paying for). This state of affairs suggests that venture capitalists won't provide funds on attractive terms. So it seems that the investors focused more on what could be, than paying attention to the current revenues (or lack thereof). For example, they may be hoping that Sterling Energy finds fossil fuels with an exploration program, before it runs out of money.Companies that lack both meaningful revenue and profits are usually considered high risk. You should be aware that there is always a chance that this sort of company will need to issue more shares to raise money to continue pursuing its business plan. While some such companies do very well over the long term, others become hyped up by promoters before eventually falling back down to earth, and going bankrupt (or being recapitalized). It certainly is a dangerous place to invest, as Sterling Energy investors might realise.Sterling Energy has plenty of cash in the bank, with cash in excess of all liabilities sitting at US$45m, when it last reported (June 2019). This gives management the flexibility to drive business growth, without worrying too much about cash reserves. But with the share price diving 15% per year, over 5 years , it could be that the price was previously too hyped up.

Given that situation, would you be concerned if it turned out insiders were relentlessly selling stock? I would feel more nervous about the company if that were so.

However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 15% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
