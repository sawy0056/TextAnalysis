The patent is for “Methods of Measuring Potential for Therapeutic Potency and Defining Dosages for Autologous Cell Therapies.” The Company also has European patent coverage for this technology.This CardiAMP patent addresses the problem of patient cell variability and high manufacturing costs associated with typical autologous cell therapy by identifying a specific biomarker signature in a patient’s bone marrow that is utilized in the CardiAMP pre-procedural selection diagnostic assay. The test enables physicians to determine if a patient is a good candidate for CardiAMP cell therapy prior to treatment, enabling point-of-care therapy processing and eliminating costly remote cell selection and processing.“We are vigorously protecting the proprietary technologies that differentiate our CardiAMP Cell Therapy System from cardiac cell therapies that have been previously studied. By adding a pre-procedural assay for patient selection, we believe we have improved upon what has come before us,” said BioCardia CEO Peter Altman, PhD. “Our cell potency assay is currently being studied in our Phase III pivotal CardiAMP Heart Failure Trial and is part of our second Phase III pivotal trial of the CardiAMP cell therapy for the treatment of chronic myocardial ischemia, which has been FDA-approved and whose start is pending.”“We are enthusiastic about the potential of CardiAMP cell therapy to improve the heart without requiring cells to become heart cells, avoiding the potential for cells to become ectopic foci causing life-threatening arrhythmias and eliminating the need for chronic immunosuppression drugs.”Two additional, newly-issued patents relate to a Radial and Trans-Endocardial Delivery Catheter for intramyocardial delivery of cardiac cell therapy, a new delivery approach for the Company. The Japan Patent Office issued Patent No: 6600301 and the China National Intellectual Property Administration issued Patent No: XL 2014 8 00653862, both of which expire in September 2034.The issued claims cover the Company’s new “Trillium” delivery catheter design for transradial arterial access that is distinct from, but built upon the design of, the company’s Helix™ Biotherapeutic Delivery System.  In the new design, the penetrating element uses a straight needle system with perforation protection “petals” that deploy automatically from the guide catheter. The “petal” configuration is designed to prevent myocardial perforation, an issue that has been seen with other straight needle catheter systems. Additional transradial designs using BioCardia’s existing 5 French Helix platform are also disclosed in the patents.Cardiac catheter insertion through the small transradial artery in the wrist is growing in popularity as a delivery approach for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). This is due to increasing evidence that it increases patient safety by reducing bleeding complications, and may help reduce costs by decreasing hospital admissions, length of stay and patient risk. Radial access is widely used outside the U.S. and has grown to more than 23 percent of PCIs, according to some estimates.“Based on physician adoption and interest in transradial access to date, we believe that our new, patented Helix and Trillium transradial designs have implications for the future of local biotherapeutic intervention in cardiology, and may play a role in the further development of our CardiAMP and CardiALLO™ biotherapeutics,” said Dr. Altman. “In the future, we would like to enable our cell therapies as an outpatient transradial procedure where patients are sent home the same day with their arm in a sling and only a simple bandage on their wrists.” About BioCardia® BioCardia, Inc., headquartered in San Carlos, California, is developing regenerative biologic therapies to treat cardiovascular disease. CardiAMP™ and CardiALLO™ cell therapies are the Company’s biotherapeutic product candidates in clinical development. The Company's current products include the Helix™ Biotherapeutic Delivery System and the Morph® steerable guide and sheath catheter portfolio, including the new AVANCE™ Steerable Introducer family. BioCardia also partners with other biotherapeutic companies to provide its Helix systems and clinical support to their programs studying therapies for the treatment of heart failure, chronic myocardial ischemia and acute myocardial infarction.Story continuesForward Looking Statements  This press release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to many risks and uncertainties.
