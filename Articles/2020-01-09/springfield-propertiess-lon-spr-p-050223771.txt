And the full year gain of 46% isn't too shabby, either!All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. See our latest analysis for Springfield Properties Does Springfield Properties Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?Springfield Properties's P/E is 11.51. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (11.8) for companies in the consumer durables industry is roughly the same as Springfield Properties's P/E.AIM:SPR Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that Springfield Properties shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. The company could surprise by performing better than average, in the future. I would further inform my view by checking insider buying and selling., among other things.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.It's nice to see that Springfield Properties grew EPS by a stonking 33% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 13%. I'd therefore be a little surprised if its P/E ratio was not relatively high.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does Springfield Properties's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Net debt totals 19% of Springfield Properties's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Verdict On Springfield Properties's P/E RatioSpringfield Properties trades on a P/E ratio of 11.5, which is below the GB market average of 18.6. The company hasn't stretched its balance sheet, and earnings growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified. What we know for sure is that investors have become more excited about Springfield Properties recently, since they have pushed its P/E ratio from 8.7 to 11.5 over the last month. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But the contrarian may see it as a missed opportunity.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
