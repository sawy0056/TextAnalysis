But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Baozun (NASDAQ:BZUN). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. See our latest analysis for Baozun How Fast Is Baozun Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Baozun has grown earnings per share (EPS) like young bamboo after rain; fast, and from a low base. So I don't think the percent growth rate is particularly meaningful. As a result, I'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Like a falcon taking flight, Baozun's EPS soared from CN¥4.07 to CN¥5.70, over the last year. That's a impressive gain of 40%.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Baozun maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 41% to CN¥6.7b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

To that end, right now and today, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for future Baozun EPS 100% free.Are Baozun Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I like company leaders to have some skin in the game, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. So it is good to see that Baozun insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at CN¥158m. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.Is Baozun Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors like me, Baozun's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Further, the high level of insider ownership impresses me, and suggests that I'm not the only one who appreciates the EPS growth. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research. So the answer is that I do think this is a good stock to follow along with. If you think Baozun might suit your style as an investor, you could go straight to its annual report, or you could first check our discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for the company.Although Baozun certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
