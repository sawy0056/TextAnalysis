And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like First Bancshares (NASDAQ:FBMS). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. View our latest analysis for First Bancshares How Quickly Is First Bancshares Increasing Earnings Per Share?As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. First Bancshares managed to grow EPS by 10.0% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). I note that First Bancshares's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort my analysis of its margins. First Bancshares maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 50% to US$136m. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of First Bancshares's forecast profits?Are First Bancshares Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?I like company leaders to have some skin in the game, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. As a result, I'm encouraged by the fact that insiders own First Bancshares shares worth a considerable sum. Indeed, they hold US$26m worth of its stock. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 4.0% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like First Bancshares with market caps between US$400m and US$1.6b is about US$2.6m.The CEO of First Bancshares only received US$894k in total compensation for the year ending December 2018. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance, that arrangement seems generous to shareholders, and points to a modest remuneration culture. While the level of CEO compensation isn't a huge factor in my view of the company, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Story continuesShould You Add First Bancshares To Your Watchlist?One positive for First Bancshares is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for First Bancshares, but the pretty picture gets better than that. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if First Bancshares is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Although First Bancshares certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
