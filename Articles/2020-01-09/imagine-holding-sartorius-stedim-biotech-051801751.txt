And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. Don't believe it? Then look at the Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A. (EPA:DIM) share price. It's 427% higher than it was five years ago. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. On top of that, the share price is up 21% in about a quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 9.2% in the last three months. View our latest analysis for Sartorius Stedim Biotech While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Sartorius Stedim Biotech achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 28% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 39% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 55.50.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).ENXTPA:DIM Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreWe know that Sartorius Stedim Biotech has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Sartorius Stedim Biotech the TSR over the last 5 years was 443%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Sartorius Stedim Biotech has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 71% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 40%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
