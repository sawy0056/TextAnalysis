It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Asia Orient Holdings Limited (HKG:214) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Asia Orient Holdings How Much Debt Does Asia Orient Holdings Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2019 Asia Orient Holdings had HK$16.6b of debt, an increase on HK$16.5k, over one year. But on the other hand it also has HK$17.0b in cash, leading to a HK$466.7m net cash position.SEHK:214 Historical Debt, January 8th 2020MoreHow Strong Is Asia Orient Holdings's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Asia Orient Holdings had liabilities of HK$4.73b due within a year, and liabilities of HK$13.6b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of HK$17.0b as well as receivables valued at HK$652.4m due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by HK$639.4m.This deficit is considerable relative to its market capitalization of HK$1.05b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on Asia Orient Holdings's use of debt.
