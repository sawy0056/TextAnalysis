A trial in New York is underway.Cicilline noted that Delrahim wrote to Ergen: "Today would be a good day to have your Senator friends contact the chairman," a reference to the chair of the Federal Communications Commission which has since approved the merger.Cicilline asked Delrahim if he had offered lobbying advice to other merging companies and if it was appropriate to offer such advice.Cicilline also pressed the antitrust chief on a report that the Trump administration has brought fewer criminal antitrust cases, essentially price-fixing, than any in 50 years. "Is it your view that market participants are no longer engaging in price-fixing at the rates they previously had?" Cicilline asked.Cicilline asked Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joe Simons about the November approval of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's <BMY.N> $74 billion purchase of Celgene on the condition it divest the drug Otezla.Cicilline asked the agency whether its practice of focusing on product overlap is enough when analyzing this and other pharmaceutical mergers.Cicilline also pressed Simons on the FTC's record $5 billion settlement with Facebook Inc <FB.O> for the social media company's violation of an earlier settlement with the agency. He cited criticism that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was not held responsible for the order violations."What is the Commission doing to ensure that CEOs of large companies are held accountable when their companies violate antitrust law with the CEOs' knowledge or at his or her direction?," Cicilline asked.An FTC spokesman declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Richard Chang)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextU.S. Moves to Raise Fees for Deportation Appeals by Nearly NinefoldThe Wall Street JournalAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Jesus Would Be Maligned As ‘Radical’ By Today’s CongressHuffPostThe Atlantic Politics Daily: Bernie’s Big VulnerabilityThe AtlanticTrump Spends 45 Minutes With ‘Deep State’ Play Actors Amid Coronavirus MayhemThe Daily BeastChinese scientist sentenced to prison in US for technology theftAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
