We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to AQ Group AB (publ)'s (STO:AQ), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is AQ Group's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 16.00. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 6.2%. Check out our latest analysis for AQ Group How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for AQ Group:P/E of 16.00 = SEK229.50 ÷ SEK14.34 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each SEK1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.How Does AQ Group's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. If you look at the image below, you can see AQ Group has a lower P/E than the average (17.7) in the electrical industry classification.OM:AQ Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that AQ Group shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.AQ Group's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 116% last year. The sweetener is that the annual five year growth rate of 16% is also impressive. With that kind of growth rate we would generally expect a high P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.So What Does AQ Group's Balance Sheet Tell Us?AQ Group's net debt is 12% of its market cap. This could bring some additional risk, and reduce the number of investment options for management; worth remembering if you compare its P/E to businesses without debt.The Verdict On AQ Group's P/E RatioAQ Group's P/E is 16.0 which is below average (19.4) in the SE market. The company hasn't stretched its balance sheet, and earnings growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.
