We'll show how you can use Sopheon plc's (LON:SPE) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Sopheon has a price to earnings ratio of 17.31, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 5.8%. Check out our latest analysis for Sopheon How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share (in the reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Sopheon:P/E of 17.31 = £8.40 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, USD ) ÷ £0.48 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each £1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Sopheon Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Sopheon has a lower P/E than the average (30.8) in the software industry classification.AIM:SPE Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Sopheon shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Sopheon's earnings per share fell by 32% in the last twelve months. But EPS is up 2.8% over the last 3 years.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does Sopheon's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Sopheon has net cash of US$19m. This is fairly high at 22% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Bottom Line On Sopheon's P/E RatioSopheon has a P/E of 17.3. That's around the same as the average in the GB market, which is 18.6. While the lack of recent growth is probably muting optimism, the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. So it's not surprising to see it trade on a P/E roughly in line with the market.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
