In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Inwido:0.091 = kr589m ÷ (kr8.0b - kr1.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Inwido has an ROCE of 9.1%. Check out our latest analysis for Inwido Is Inwido's ROCE Good?One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies. In this analysis, Inwido's ROCE appears meaningfully below the 13% average reported by the Building industry. This could be seen as a negative, as it suggests some competitors may be employing their capital more efficiently. Independently of how Inwido compares to its industry, its ROCE in absolute terms appears decent, and the company may be worthy of closer investigation.You can click on the image below to see (in greater detail) how Inwido's past growth compares to other companies.OM:INWI Past Revenue and Net Income, January 8th 2020MoreRemember that this metric is backwards looking - it shows what has happened in the past, and does not accurately predict the future. Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Are Current Liabilities, And How Do They Affect Inwido's ROCE?Current liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Inwido has total liabilities of kr1.6b and total assets of kr8.0b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 20% of its total assets. Low current liabilities are not boosting the ROCE too much.The Bottom Line On Inwido's ROCEWith that in mind, Inwido's ROCE appears pretty good. Inwido shapes up well under this analysis,
