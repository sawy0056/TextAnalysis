Macy's operates about 860 stores in the United States.For the full quarter, analysts were expecting a 1.8% decline in same-store sales, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."It's bit of a relief for investors, as they were concerned sales were going to be down more than that," Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics told Reuters.Given the traffic at stores did not look particularly great during the holidays, the sales number looks good, Perkins said.He cautioned, however, that heavy discounting during the season could dent the company's margins.Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said Macy's holiday sales benefited from online purchases and demand for gift products, as well as a complete revamp of about 150 stores with fresh interiors and better merchandise.U.S. consumers are increasingly spending more money online rather than queuing up at physical stores during the holiday season, forcing traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to invest in more shopping and delivery options.U.S. e-commerce sales in the period from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve rose 18.8%, according to a Dec. 25 report by Mastercard Inc <MA.N>, while overall holiday retail sales, excluding autos, rose just 3.4%.Consumer spending in the country is benefiting from wage growth and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century.Shares of the company, which rose as much as 5%, were marginally up at $17.78.(Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru and Melissa Fares in New York; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Shounak Dasgupta)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth-quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersWRAPUP 2-U.S. economy grows steadily in Q4, but coronavirus looms largeReutersThe Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Buckle, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Deckers Outdoor, Malibu Boats and Ralph LaurenZacksIs Coronavirus a Short-lived Slump for Payment Stocks?ZacksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
