FeNO—Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide- is exhaled in a patient's breath."Offering Fenom Pro is another example of Vyaire offering healthcare providers best-in-class, easy-to-use diagnostic, management and treatment tools for respiratory conditions in any healthcare setting," said Lisa Rose, chief innovation officer.

The measurements obtained from Fenom Pro can assist in evaluating treatment response for certain conditions, such as asthma. Data from Fenom Pro will also integrate with Vyaire's SentrySuite™ software platform, offering healthcare providers more context and information about each patient's unique respiratory condition."Partnering with Vyaire will enable Spirosure to offer easy and reliable FeNO measurement to top respiratory labs in the US and Europe," said Vivek Balasubramanyam, VP of Sales and Marketing. "This is a tremendous opportunity for us, and for all asthma patients to gain access to routine FeNO monitoring as part of their care."About FeNONitric Oxide (NO) is produced in the lungs and becomes more concentrated when the lungs are inflamed due to allergic asthma. FeNO is a standardized measure of this concentration and provides a quick and non-invasive biomarker for airway inflammation. Measurement of FeNO helps assess the need for anti-inflammatory medication and supports ongoing monitoring of anti-inflammatory therapy for conditions like asthma. Routine FeNO testing can help allergists, pulmonologists and respiratory therapists determine the best treatment path, and avoid potentially unnecessary medicines.About SPIROSURESpirosure Inc. was founded in 2011 in Pleasanton, California by Dr. Solomon Ssenyange and Ryan Leard.
