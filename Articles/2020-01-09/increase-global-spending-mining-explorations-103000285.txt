Rising global demand for natural resources and increasing investments by mining MNCs in developing economies were identified as the key trends driving the revenue boost."As multinational mining companies have expanded their geographic footprint, the focus on developing a safe working environment has increased and has resulted in the industry adopting a 'safety-first' culture," said Sanjiv Bhaskar, Vice President of Research, Frost & Sullivan.

However, Latin America and the Rest of the World (RoW), especially Asia-Pacific, are most likely to emerge as the fastest-growing mining PPE markets in the next five years. An abundance of natural resources, the adoption of progressive mining policies, and the permeation of a robust work safety culture from MNCs to smaller mining organizations are expected to play a pivotal role in driving these markets."Geological potential, coupled with the political stability of the host countries, is expected to play a key role in fostering mining activities," noted Bhaskar. "In turn, it is likely to provide PPE manufacturers with additional revenue-generation opportunities in the future."PPE manufacturers could potentially supplement their revenues by: Entering into partnerships with mining companies to supply PPE products. Helping mining companies develop and implement effective work-safety procedures. Offering training services for the selection and usage of PPE. Establishing an efficient supply chain to ensure timely delivery of products to remotely located mines.Global Mining Industry Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Market, Forecast to 2023, is a part of Frost & Sullivan's Chemicals, Materials & Food Growth Partnership Service program, which helps organizations identify a continuous flow of growth opportunities to succeed in an unpredictable future.About Frost & SullivanFor over five decades, Frost & Sullivan has become world-renowned for its role in helping investors, corporate leaders and governments navigate economic changes and identify disruptive technologies, Mega Trends, new business models and companies to action, resulting in a continuous flow of growth opportunities to drive future success.
