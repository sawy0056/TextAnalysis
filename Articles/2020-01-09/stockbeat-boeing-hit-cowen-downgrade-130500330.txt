But later the embassy removed the statement and claimed that "the causes of the accident prior to the decision of the commission are not official."The latest crash raised concerns about Boeing's operational fleet at a time when its 737 Max, which was involved in two fatal crashes last year, remains grounded costing the aircraft maker billions.In the third quarter of 2019, the jet's continued grounding cost Boeing $900 million, taking the total to $9.2 billion.And costs will likely continue to increase as federal regulators have repeatedly said there is no firm timeline to allow the Max to hit the skies again.Related ArticlesLennar Numbers Give Hope to HomebuildersBond Bears See Ray of Light as U.S.-Iran Tensions Appear to EaseGermany stocks higher at close of trade; DAX up 0.71%ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBoeing airplanes boss earns big stock award after strong launch of new divisionAmerican City Business JournalsP&G veteran tapped for C-suite at BoeingAmerican City Business JournalsGovernment leaders talk layoff response and building Wichita’s future to Emerging LeadersAmerican City Business JournalsCanada mulling made-in-Ottawa supplement to Boeing's 737 MAX flight manualReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
