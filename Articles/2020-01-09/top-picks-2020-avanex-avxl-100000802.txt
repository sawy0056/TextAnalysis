Though there are 4 drugs approved, none of them really works beyond 6 months. It is currently in a 1-year, 450-patient Phase 2b/3 Alzheimer’s trial that is halfway through enrollment. If successful, the company will file for provisional approval.See also:

Nothing on the market today can come even close to this and if the company can prove this in the Australian trial it will be on track to become the lead Alzheimer’s drug in a market that is at least $10 billion worldwide.See also: Top Picks 2020: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Proof of the pudding, 94% of those who have completed the current 1-year trial period are voluntarily continuing to take A2-73, and some (from the earlier Phase 2a trial) have continued for as much as 3 to 4 more years now. Sometimes that speaks louder than the hard data.In addition, Anavex is currently wrapping up a Phase 2, 120-patient study with A2-73 for Parkinson’s dementia and is working on three Phase 2 trials for Rett Syndrome, a devastating disease that strikes girls in infancy handicapping them severely in almost every function.Data from these trials are expected in 2020. I could go on for pages. There are no guarantees on Wall Street, but I hope you will agree that the above at least stacks the odds in our favor.More From MoneyShow.com:Top Picks 2020: Alphabet (GOOGL)Top Picks 2020: Americold Realty Trust (COLD)Top Picks 2020: Signet Jewelers (SIG)Top Picks 2020: Boeing Company (BA)Top Picks 2020: Best Buy (BBY)Top Picks 2020: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
