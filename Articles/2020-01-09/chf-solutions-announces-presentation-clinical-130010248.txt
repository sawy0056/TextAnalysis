The study was presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s Kidney Week in Washington, D.C. in November 2019.“We have found that aquapheresis with Aquadex FlexFlow can be safely utilized in situations other than diuretic resistant heart failure, such as critical care in patients experiencing cardiogenic shock, anasarca, ATN with fluid overload, ESRD with bridge ultrafiltration between hemodialysis treatment, and post-op volume overload,” said Dr. Maria V. DeVita, Nephrologist, Lenox Hill Hospital. “Because the Aquadex FlexFlow system is safe and easy to use when compared to more complex hemodialysis systems, these patients were treated in different critical care settings including the cardiothoracic ICU, CCU, medical ICU and the post-op ICU.”“These results continue to support our assertion that the Aquadex FlexFlow system is a key component in cardiorenal care. This analysis from a leading center in New York City is further validation of this assertion,” said John Erb, CEO of CHF Solutions. “We are extremely pleased with the feedback we consistently receive from healthcare providers on the benefits of aquapheresis with the Aquadex FlexFlow system to manage fluid volume in a variety of contexts.”The analysis looked at 23 patients who received aquapheresis treatment following cardiogenic shock, including post cardiothoracic procedure, anasarca, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with volume overload, bridge ultrafiltration in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) between hemodialysis, and post-operative volume overload. The average duration of treatment with Aquadex FlexFlow per patient was 4.26 days. Researchers noted that, despite the significant volume removed per day (1,954 mls) and per encounter (8,323mls), there was no significant change in creatinine (an indicator of renal function). Investigators also noted the ease of using the Aquadex FlexFlow system compared to the more complicated operation of hemodialysis equipment.About CHF SolutionsCHF Solutions, Inc.
