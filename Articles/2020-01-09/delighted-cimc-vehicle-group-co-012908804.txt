With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of CIMC Vehicle (Group) Co., Ltd. (HKG:1839).Our data shows CIMC Vehicle (Group) has a return on equity of 17% for the last year. That means that for every HK$1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated HK$0.17 in profit. View our latest analysis for CIMC Vehicle (Group) How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for CIMC Vehicle (Group):17% = CN¥1.4b ÷ CN¥8.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does ROE Mean?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else being equal, a high ROE is better than a low one. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does CIMC Vehicle (Group) Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, CIMC Vehicle (Group) has a higher ROE than the average (9.8%) in the Machinery industry.SEHK:1839 Past Revenue and Net Income, January 8th 2020MoreThat's what I like to see. I usually take a closer look when a company has a better ROE than industry peers. One data point to check is if insiders have bought shares recently.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining CIMC Vehicle (Group)'s Debt And Its 17% Return On EquityCIMC Vehicle (Group) has a debt to equity ratio of 0.22, which is far from excessive. Its very respectable ROE, combined with only modest debt, suggests the business is in good shape. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.In SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Story continuesBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
