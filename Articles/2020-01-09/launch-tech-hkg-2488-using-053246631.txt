So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Launch Tech Company Limited (HKG:2488) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Launch Tech What Is Launch Tech's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2019 Launch Tech had CN¥231.0m of debt, an increase on CN¥353, over one year. But it also has CN¥277.1m in cash to offset that, meaning it has CN¥46.1m net cash.SEHK:2488 Historical Debt, January 8th 2020MoreHow Healthy Is Launch Tech's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Launch Tech had liabilities of CN¥636.7m due within 12 months and liabilities of CN¥18.7m due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of CN¥277.1m as well as receivables valued at CN¥369.0m due within 12 months. So its total liabilities are just about perfectly matched by its shorter-term, liquid assets.This state of affairs indicates that Launch Tech's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the CN¥1.15b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Launch Tech also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Also positive, Launch Tech grew its EBIT by 29% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward.

Launch Tech may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. In the last three years, Launch Tech's free cash flow amounted to 36% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.Story continuesSumming upWe could understand if investors are concerned about Launch Tech's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of CN¥46.1m.
