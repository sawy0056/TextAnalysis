To name a few, Accenture Interactive, PwC Digital Services, IBM iX and Deloitte Digital.These new agencies offer traditional marketing services but their main value-add is in the integration of the emerging technologies along with strategic consultation to provide a one-stop shop solution to help build brands.This has greatly benefitted the Fortune 500 companies of the world but have left the rest behind. Medium-sized enterprises and smaller start-ups simply cannot afford these consultancies, which can charge upwards of $2000 per hour. At the other end of the marketing industry are smaller digital agencies made up of teams with no real experience,These SMEs are often faced with the decision to either splash out on a top tier digital marketing agency or hire a cheaper but unproven team.Decade Digital is a digital marketing agency that was born to bridge this gap, by offering best-in-class and enterprise grade digital marketing solutions to companies at a fraction of what the biggest ad agencies charge.
