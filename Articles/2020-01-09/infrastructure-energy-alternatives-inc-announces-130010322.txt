(IEA) (“IEA” or the “Company”), a leading infrastructure construction company with specialized energy and heavy civil expertise, today announced a wind energy project award in Illinois.The award is for construction of the Blooming Grove Wind Energy Center in McLean County. The project’s planned 94 turbines will generate an estimated 250 megawatts of power that will be delivered into the Illinois electrical grid. It is estimated that the project will generate enough energy to power 69,000 homes annually.Work began in September 2019 and the project is expected to be fully operational in late 2020.
