Toshiba's speech recognition AI not only recognizes speech with high accuracy, but also detects fillers and hesitation markers. By using the increasingly popular model known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as well as Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), the AI was taught about speech peculiarities such as fillers and hesitation markers that are exclusive to human beings.Story continuesUsing lectures as an opportunity for verification testing, the speech recognition AI has achieved an average speech recognition ratio of 85%, recognizing the contents of speech above a certain level without editing or advance learning. Toshiba will continue to work on the improvement of this technology to achieve a fully accurate speech recognition offering with the goal of creating an environment where speakers of different languages will be able to enjoy a smooth conversation with one another.Toshiba also sees potential in applying speech recognition AI to the manufacturing sector, where there is a need for hands-free voice collection and recording in factories during maintenance and inspections. In the future, Toshiba aims to use its accumulated knowledge and know-how on manufacturing facilities to seamlessly integrate speech recognition into their operations.Photo - https://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20191223/2678594-1-aPhoto - https://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20191223/2678594-1-bPhoto - https://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20191223/2678594-1-cSOURCE Toshiba CorporationReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
