The combination of Accruent and Attainia delivers accurate information to aid in all MELC phases and increase confidence in capital planning decisions.In order to truly know and reduce the total cost of asset ownership, organizations must implement full asset lifecycle management – from pre-assessment through acquisition and support to final disposition. Informed purchasing decisions based on total visibility of organizational needs, can further reduce the total cost of ownership of assets and positively impact organizational bottom lines. In addition, using objective data to create multi-year strategic capital replacement plans increases the ability to negotiate discounts and improves outcomes from construction and facility renovation projects.Hospital systems struggle with complete equipment lifecycle management challenges across healthcare technology and facilities management departments. The partnership between Accruent and Attainia brings together two of the most powerful tools available to identify additional cost-saving opportunities for HTM and HFM professionals.Effective medical equipment lifecycle management tools help healthcare organizations:Improve patient care through streamlined processes, efficiencies and cost reduction Quickly generate and update accurate equipment budgets Collaborate and centralize capital equipment decision processes Reduce expensive change orders and project completion delays Prioritize, forecast and control capital expenditures for immediate and long-term budgetsThe combination of Accruent and Attainia delivers these benefits by providing:A standardized equipment catalog with more than 63,000 SKUs for medical furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E) that improves asset data integrity, reduces complexity and streamlines project creation Tools for collaboration on equipment planning and approval workflows to ensure that these processes are efficient and predictable with minimal deviations, which dramatically reduces the number of change orders  A single, consolidated, real-time view of all capital equipment spend, comparisons of planned and actual spend, and breakdowns of strategic and routine system-wide spend which enables cross-organizational strategic planning, resulting in larger purchasing discounts  Aggregated analytics that facilitate data-driven planning to help reduce the total cost of equipment ownership "The Accruent and Attainia partnership will dramatically impact the way our healthcare clients and future prospects manage their capital equipment," said DJ Chhabra, Attainia CEO and chairman of the board.
