(TSE:EXE) For The 5.6% DividendSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosDividend paying stocks like Extendicare Inc. (TSE:EXE) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.With Extendicare yielding 5.6% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Extendicare for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis TSX:EXE Historical Dividend Yield, January 8th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 1376% of Extendicare's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, from the perspective of an investor who hopes to own the company for many years, a payout ratio of above 100% is definitely a concern.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Extendicare paid out 1453% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. As Extendicare's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.Is Extendicare's Balance Sheet Risky?As Extendicare's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). Extendicare is carrying net debt of 4.23 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the upper limit of our comfort range on a dividend stock that the investor hopes will endure a wide range of economic circumstances.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 2.05 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Extendicare, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Extendicare's latest financial position,

Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Extendicare's dividend payments. This company's dividend has not fluctuated wildly, but its dividend per share payments have still decreased substantially over this time, which is not ideal. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was CA$0.84 in 2010, compared to CA$0.48 last year. This works out to be a decline of approximately 5.4% per year over that time.Story continuesWhen a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Over the past five years, it looks as though Extendicare's EPS have declined at around 22% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective, as even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Extendicare's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Extendicare paid out almost all of its cash flow and profit as dividends, leaving little to reinvest in the business. It's not great to see earnings per share shrinking. The dividends have been relatively consistent, but we wonder for how much longer this will be true. There are a few too many issues for us to get comfortable with Extendicare from a dividend perspective. Businesses can change, but we would struggle to identify why an investor should rely on this stock for their income.Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from costs or inflation. Very few businesses see earnings consistently shrink year after year in perpetuity though, and so it might be worth seeing what the 3 analysts we track are forecasting for the future.Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
