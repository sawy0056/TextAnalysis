I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.EPAM Systems's 62% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. The cherry on top is that the five year growth rate was an impressive 25% per year. So I'd be surprised if the P/E ratio was not above average.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Is Debt Impacting EPAM Systems's P/E?The extra options and safety that comes with EPAM Systems's US$828m net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.The Verdict On EPAM Systems's P/E RatioEPAM Systems trades on a P/E ratio of 47.6, which is above its market average of 18.7.
