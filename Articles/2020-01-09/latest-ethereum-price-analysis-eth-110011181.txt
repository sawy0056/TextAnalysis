Looking at the current Bitcoin trend, I expect price to continue pumping towards the 50-day and 200-day EMAs over the next week.For now, I would aim at making minor entries while the price is still below the 200-day EMA. Volume-wise, ETH is hovering close to $10 billion – close to five times higher than the previous weeks.At the moment, buyers are taking control, which means volatility can be expected to increase.Since ETH is also close to the lowest support level intervals (according to the volume profile), we should expect the price to keep rebounding.Right now, Ethereum is holding above $140. If there’s another swing to the upside, I expect ETH to face resistance near the 200-day EMA, between $170 and $180.On an equally positive note, the Istanbul upgrade has been implemented successfully with only a few minor issues. This hard fork was quite an important step towards ETH 2.0 and has implemented improved functionality and lower gas fees.I personally believe we can expect a testnet release of the new Casper PoS soon, at least by the first quarter of 2020.Safe trades!About EthereumEthereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015.
