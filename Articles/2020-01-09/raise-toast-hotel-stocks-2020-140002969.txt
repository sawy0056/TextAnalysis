Visa restrictions will certainly make it difficult for international travelers to gain entry into the United States. Also, election-related uncertainty this year may affect demand. At the same time, apprehensions of a recession and saturation of some branded hoteliers add to the concerns.But the U.S. economy continues to hold ground, displaying outstanding resilience. What’s more, consumer spending has increased significantly and consumers are now more confident about their well-being.

The U.S. Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence continues to remain high, as it came in at 126.5 for December. In fact, November’s reading was raised from 125.5 to 126.8. Moreover, the index that shows how consumers feel about the economy right now rose 4.4 points to 170. But what made Americans feel so confident? It’s a strong labor market and the lowest level of The unemployment in a half-century.Needless to say, tax cuts have been a blessing in disguise for the hotel industry. On an individual level, tax cuts will boost paychecks for many workers, resulting in higher discretionary income for leisure travel. This in turn will boost revenues for hoteliers. Major hotels, in the meantime, will advantage from the corporate tax cut and spend the surplus money on business development and growth in America.The Average daily rate (ADR), in the meantime, is expected to increase to $131 by the end of 2020, representing an average yearly increase of 0.6%.
