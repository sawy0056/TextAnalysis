"Recently, we've been focused on sharing of documents across platforms. Now we'll be able to look at discrete data. Additionally, we'll continue to standardize around data elements and see better collaboration between EMS and hospital emergency departments."Key Hospital Predictions for 2020:Evolution of interoperability to improve delivery of care: In the last few years, the industry has focused on interoperability as a sharing of forms and documents between organizations. We will see much more sophistication around interoperability in 2020, with an emphasis on sharing of discrete data elements – including specific treatment fields and specific types of clinical data – between systems, platforms and registries (such as trauma registries). Standardization around data elements: As smart and discrete data continue to play crucial roles across the entire healthcare spectrum, it will be essential for organizations to standardize around data elements to better share information – both internally and with outside partners – to ensure consistency of care. Additionally, standardizing around data elements will help with reimbursement challenges. Stronger cooperation between EMS agencies and hospital emergency departments: There will be a greater emphasis on integrated and efficient communication between hospital emergency departments and EMS agencies. Not only will hospitals be looking for improved communication to better prepare for incoming patients, EMS agencies will be looking for outcome data to improve training. Additionally, as hospitals deal with reimbursement challenges, EMS can partner with hospitals to help them be financially viable and accelerate reimbursements. Hospitals are getting more and more squeezed dealing with reimbursement challenges: Hospital reimbursement from federal, state and third-party payers continues to decline. This increases pressure on hospitals to reduce expenses and control costs while continuing to improve the care delivered to patients. The costs can be significant.
