But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Neurones (EPA:NRO). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. See our latest analysis for Neurones Neurones's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). It's no surprise, then, that I like to invest in companies with EPS growth. Over the last three years, Neurones has grown EPS by 9.6% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Neurones maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 3.7% to €501m. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So as you can imagine, the fact that Neurones insiders own a significant number of shares certainly appeals to me. Indeed, with a collective holding of 69%, company insiders are in control and have plenty of capital behind the venture. To me this is a good sign because it suggests they will be incentivised to build value for shareholders over the long term. At the current share price, that insider holding is worth a whopping €341m. That means they have plenty of their own capital riding on the performance of the business!It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalizations between €180m and €718m, like Neurones, the median CEO pay is around €397k.Neurones offered total compensation worth €220k to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. I'd also argue reasonable pay levels attest to good decision making more generally.Does Neurones Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As I already mentioned, Neurones is a growing business, which is what I like to see. Earnings growth might be the main game for Neurones, but the fun does not stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, I'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least.
