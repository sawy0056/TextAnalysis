We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to NV Bekaert SA's (EBR:BEKB), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. NV Bekaert has a P/E ratio of 33.32, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 3.0%. Check out our latest analysis for NV Bekaert How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings

That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does NV Bekaert Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (10.5) for companies in the metals and mining industry is a lot lower than NV Bekaert's P/E.ENXTBR:BEKB Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects NV Bekaert will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.NV Bekaert's earnings per share fell by 71% in the last twelve months. And EPS is down 10% a year, over the last 5 years. This might lead to muted expectations.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).NV Bekaert's Balance SheetNV Bekaert's net debt is 82% of its market cap. This is a reasonably significant level of debt -- all else being equal you'd expect a much lower P/E than if it had net cash.The Bottom Line On NV Bekaert's P/E RatioNV Bekaert's P/E is 33.3 which is above average (17.3) in its market.
