INRIX Signal Analytics powered by the Center for Advanced Transportation Technology (CATT Lab) is a scalable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective analytics platform to help cities and transportation agencies monitor, manage and measure the performance of individual or an entire road network of signalized intersections.INRIX provides unique insight into the movement of people and commerce across transportation networks worldwide. Our services help millions of drivers find a better way to go as well as help cities make our transportation networks work smarter. (PRNewsfoto/INRIX)MoreTraditionally, attempts to qualify and reduce unnecessary delays at intersections have required installing hardware and conducting fieldwork. Signal Analytics enables transportation agencies to implement industry-defined signal performance measures – by intersection, movement, time of day and day of week – purely from vehicle movement data; no roadside infrastructure required. The platform also allows agencies to easily identify, rank and prioritize intersection signal projects to achieve maximum impact on traffic flow."INRIX has achieved the necessary intersection penetration rates and device ping frequencies required to calculate the desired intersection metrics to aid cities in making decisions about how to best manage their intersections. Sufficient data granularity at the intersection level is a high bar but with the right data and insights, we knew we had a solution for traffic operators," said Jeff Summerson, Director – Product Management, INRIX.Actionable, Effective Metrics With a 1.5-5.5% penetration rate at every relevant intersection in the U.S., transportation agencies can assess and make key decisions to prioritize projects, then quantify the effectiveness on individual intersections, corridors or an entire system. Initial metrics available at all intersections include:Arrival on Green: Percent of vehicles without a stop recorded within the intersection crossing Stopped Vehicles: Number of observed vehicles that stopped at the intersection Actual Movements: Number of observed movements at the intersection for a chosen time period Travel Time: Distribution of time for each movement sequence in the intersection Approach Speed: Speed distribution of vehicles directly before the intersection Intersection Delay: Observed vehicle delays at the intersection by movement"Studies show classic signal retiming can achieve near the same benefits as expensive adaptive systems. Utilizing expanded anonymous data from connected vehicles, INRIX is eliminating traditional cost, time and equipment expenditures while enabling robust and accurate insights of intersections. With over 300,000 traffic signals in the U.S. alone, the benefit to travellers, transportation agencies and the environment is nearly unquantifiable," said Ted Trepanier, P.E., Sr. Director – Public Sector Services, INRIX.Signal Analytics is part of a new global suite of innovative road performance analytics and data visualizations also announced today. INRIX Analytics powered by the CATT Lab offers access to highly accurate data and tools to help transportation agencies assess and make key decisions on the performance of national, regional and city road networks. INRIX Analytics combines decades of expertise and development that INRIX and the CATT Lab have both made in transportation analytics.INRIX Signal Analytics will be available in North America starting later this year.
