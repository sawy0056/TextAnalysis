"The Solutionary Guidebook provides a clear process with examples and resources that any teacher can use to develop the research, systems analysis, and critical and creative thinking skills that young people need to become solutionaries. This amazing guide offers teachers a dependable companion as they dive into this essential work with their students. I haven't seen anything quite like it in my 25 years as an educator."The Solutionary Guidebook provides an easy-to-use, fully accessible solutionary process for teachers to use in their classrooms.The guidebook is divided into three parts. Part I outlines the rationale for educating students to be solutionaries; Part II offers a step-by-step process and grade- and subject-specific case studies from many Maine teachers who have used IHE's solutionary approach; and Part III provides supplementary resources.IHE will be launching a Solutionary YouTube channel in the spring so that students from across Maine, as well as around the world, can share their solutions to problems. The process for submitting videos is described in the Solutionary Guidebook as well.For more information about the Institute for Humane Education and its efforts to educate students to be solutionaries, please visit http://www.humaneeducation.org. SOURCE Institute for Humane EducationReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextInside Wendy ’s New NeverlandArchitectural DigestWhen I'm Feeling Bogged Down, I Turn to These 4 Tips to Boost My CreativityPopSugarBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
