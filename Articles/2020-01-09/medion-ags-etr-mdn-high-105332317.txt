We'll look at Medion AG's (ETR:MDN) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. Medion has a P/E ratio of 21.72, based on the last twelve months. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying €21.72 for every €1 in prior year profit. See our latest analysis for Medion How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Medion:P/E of 21.72 = €14.30 ÷ €0.66 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Medion Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that Medion has a higher P/E than the average (13.1) P/E for companies in the retail distributors industry.XTRA:MDN Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Medion will outperform other companies in its industry. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Medion saw earnings per share decrease by 8.6% last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 1.7%.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting Medion's P/E?With net cash of €126m, Medion has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 20% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On Medion's P/E RatioMedion trades on a P/E ratio of 21.7, which is fairly close to the DE market average of 20.9. While the lack of recent growth is probably muting optimism, the net cash position means it's not surprising that expectations put the company roughly in line with the market average P/E.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. People often underestimate remarkable growth -- so investors can make money when fast growth is not fully appreciated. We don't have analyst forecasts, but shareholders might want to examine this detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesYou might be able to find a better buy than Medion.
