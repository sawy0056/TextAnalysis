To keep it practical, we'll show how Enea AB (publ)'s (STO:ENEA) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Enea has a P/E ratio of 18.14, based on the last twelve months. That means that at current prices, buyers pay SEK18.14 for every SEK1 in trailing yearly profits. See our latest analysis for Enea How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Enea:P/E of 18.14 = SEK180.00 ÷ SEK9.92 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does Enea Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. As you can see below Enea has a P/E ratio that is fairly close for the average for the it industry, which is 18.6.OM:ENEA Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that Enea shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. So if Enea actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Enea's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 79% last year. The sweetener is that the annual five year growth rate of 18% is also impressive. So I'd be surprised if the P/E ratio was not above average.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.So What Does Enea's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Enea has net debt worth just 4.7% of its market capitalization. It would probably trade on a higher P/E ratio if it had a lot of cash, but I doubt it is having a big impact.The Bottom Line On Enea's P/E RatioEnea's P/E is 18.1 which is about average (19.4) in the SE market. Given it has reasonable debt levels, and grew earnings strongly last year, the P/E indicates the market has doubts this growth can be sustained.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If it is underestimating a company, investors can make money by buying and holding the shares until the market corrects itself.
