However, the annual gain of 6.3% wasn't so impressive.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. See our latest analysis for Taiga Building Products Does Taiga Building Products Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 6.33 that sentiment around Taiga Building Products isn't particularly high. The image below shows that Taiga Building Products has a lower P/E than the average (13.7) P/E for companies in the trade distributors industry.TSX:TBL Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreTaiga Building Products's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with Taiga Building Products, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.Taiga Building Products's 463% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. Regrettably, the longer term performance is poor, with EPS down 11% per year over 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Taiga Building Products's Balance SheetNet debt totals 69% of Taiga Building Products's market cap. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you should absolutely keep in mind it has significant borrowings.The Verdict On Taiga Building Products's P/E RatioTaiga Building Products trades on a P/E ratio of 6.3, which is below the CA market average of 15.7. While the EPS growth last year was strong, the significant debt levels reduce the number of options available to management. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low. What we know for sure is that investors are becoming less uncomfortable about Taiga Building Products's prospects, since they have pushed its P/E ratio from 4.8 to 6.3 over the last month. If you like to buy stocks that could be turnaround opportunities, then this one might be a candidate; but if you're more sensitive to price, then you may feel the opportunity has passed.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
