But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Central Valley Community Bancorp (NASDAQ:CVCY) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 108% in five years. In the last week shares have slid back 2.0%. See our latest analysis for Central Valley Community Bancorp To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Central Valley Community Bancorp achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 16% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqCM:CVCY Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Central Valley Community Bancorp, it has a TSR of 126% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveCentral Valley Community Bancorp provided a TSR of 16% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 18% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market.
