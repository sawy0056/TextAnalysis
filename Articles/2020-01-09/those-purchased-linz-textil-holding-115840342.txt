But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term Linz Textil Holding AG (VIE:LTH) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 21% in three years, versus a market return of about 34%. See our latest analysis for Linz Textil Holding While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Although the share price is down over three years, Linz Textil Holding actually managed to grow EPS by 8.2% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.With a rather small yield of just 1.4% we doubt that the stock's share price is based on its dividend. Arguably the revenue decline of 4.9% per year has people thinking Linz Textil Holding is shrinking. After all, if revenue keeps shrinking, it may be difficult to find earnings growth in the future.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).WBAG:LTH Income Statement, January 8th 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at Linz Textil Holding's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Linz Textil Holding, it has a TSR of -3.7% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveLinz Textil Holding shareholders are down 5.4% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 13%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 3.3%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.
