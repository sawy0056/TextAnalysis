any Effect resulting from any actions taken by the Company at the express request or direction of the Offeror; or any Effect attributable to (i) an act or omission carried out or omitted by the Offeror in connection with the Tender Offer or (ii) the Tender Offer (for the sake of clarity, including but not limited to Effects arising out of the announcement of, entry into, pendency of, anticipated completion of actions required or contemplated by or performance of obligations under, the Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby), including any termination of, reduction in or similar adverse impact on contractual relationships with any customers, suppliers, distributors, partners or employees of the Pihlajalinna Group.Further and notwithstanding the above, Material Adverse Change shall not be deemed to exist as a result of any Effect attributable to (i) any requirement or condition set by the antitrust authorities for the Authority Approval or (ii) any matters that have been fairly disclosed by or on behalf of the Company prior to the signing of the Combination Agreement.With respect to the Condition to Completion in section 10) above, the terms and conditions of the external financing provided to the Offeror and/or its affiliates for the purposes of the Tender Offer are described in section "Background and Objectives--Financing of the Tender Offer" above.The Offeror reserves the right to withdraw the Tender Offer in the event that any of the above Conditions to Completion is not fulfilled.The Offeror can only invoke any of the Conditions to Completion so as to cause the Tender Offer not to proceed, to lapse or to be withdrawn if the circumstances which give rise to the right to invoke the relevant Condition to Completion have a significant meaning to the Offeror in view of the Tender Offer, as referred to in the Regulations and Guidelines 9/2013 on Takeover Bids and Mandatory Bids (as amended) issued by the FFSA.The Conditions to Completion set out herein are the exhaustive conditions for the completion of the Tender Offer.The Offeror reserves the right to waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any of the Conditions to Completion that have not been satisfied.Obligation to Increase the Tender Offer or to Pay CompensationThe Offeror reserves the right to acquire Shares in public trading on Nasdaq Helsinki or otherwise outside the Tender Offer before, during and after the Offer Period (including any extension thereof) and any Subsequent Offer Period to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.Should the Offeror or any party acting in concert with it as referred to in Chapter 11, Section 5 of the Securities Market Act acquire Shares after the Announcement and before the expiry of the Offer Period at a higher price than the Offer Price, or otherwise on terms that are more favorable than those of the Tender Offer, the Offeror must, according to Chapter 11, Section 25 of the Securities Market Act, amend the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer to correspond to such acquisition on more favorable terms (obligation to increase the offer). The Offeror shall then, without delay, make public the increase obligation and pay, in connection with the completion of the Tender Offer, the difference between the more favorable acquisition terms and the consideration offered in the Tender Offer to the holders of securities who have accepted the Tender Offer.Should the Offeror or any party acting in concert with it as referred to in Chapter 11, Section 5 of the Securities Market Act acquire Shares within nine (9) months after the expiry of the Offer Period at a higher price than the Offer Price, or otherwise on more favorable terms than those of the Tender Offer, the Offeror must, according to Chapter 11, Section 25 of the Securities Market Act, compensate those holders of securities who have accepted the Tender Offer for the amount equal to the difference between the more favorable acquisition terms and the consideration offered in the Tender Offer (obligation to compensate). The Offeror shall then, without delay, make public the compensation obligation and pay the difference between the more favorable acquisition terms and the consideration offered in the Tender Offer within one (1) month after the date when the compensation obligation arose to the holders of securities who have accepted the Tender Offer.However, according to Chapter 11, Section 25, Subsection 5 of the Securities Market Act, the compensation obligation shall not arise in case the payment of a higher price than the Offer Price is based on an arbitral award pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, provided that the Offeror or any party acting in concert with it as referred to in Chapter 11, Section 5 of the Securities Market Act has not offered to acquire Shares on terms that are more favorable than those of the Tender Offer before or during the arbitral proceedings.Acceptance Procedure of the Tender OfferThe Tender Offer may be accepted by a shareholder registered during the Offer Period in the shareholders' register of Pihlajalinna, with the exception of Pihlajalinna and its subsidiaries. The Tender Offer must be accepted separately for each book-entry account. A shareholder of the Company giving the acceptance must have a cash account with a financial institution operating in Finland or abroad (see also sections "-Terms of Payment and Settlement of Shares" and "Important Information"). A shareholder may only accept the Tender Offer unconditionally and with respect to all Shares on the book-entry account mentioned in the acceptance form on the date and time of the execution of the sale and purchase of the Shares. An acceptance given during the Offer Period is effective also until the end of any extended Offer Period.Most of the Finnish book-entry account operators are expected to send a notification of the Tender Offer, including instructions and the relevant acceptance form to their customers who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of the Company maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy ("Euroclear"). Shareholders of Pihlajalinna who do not receive such instructions or an acceptance form from their book-entry account operator or asset manager should primarily contact their book-entry account operator or asset manager. Shareholders can contact Nordea Bank Abp ("Nordea") by sending an email to PIHLISoffer@nordea.com in order to receive information for submitting their acceptance, or, if such shareholders are U.S. residents or located within the United States, they may contact their brokers for the necessary information.A shareholder in the Company whose shareholdings are registered in the name of a nominee and who wishes to accept the Tender Offer shall effect such acceptance in accordance with the nominee's instructions. The Offeror will not send acceptance forms or other documents related to the Tender Offer to such shareholders of the Company.Pledged Shares may only be tendered with the consent of the relevant pledgee. The obtaining of such consent shall be the responsibility of the relevant shareholder in the Company. The consent by the pledgee shall be delivered to the book-entry account operator in writing.A shareholder in the Company who is registered as a shareholder in the shareholders' register of the Company and who wishes to accept the Tender Offer shall submit a properly completed and duly executed acceptance form to the book-entry account operator managing the shareholder's book-entry account in accordance with its instructions and within the time limit set by the book-entry account operator or, in the case such book-entry account operator does not accept acceptance notifications, such shareholder shall contact primarily its own bank to give its acceptance to tender its Shares, or secondarily contact Nordea by sending an email to PIHLISoffer@nordea.com  for further information. The acceptance form shall be submitted so that it is received during the Offer Period or, if the Offer Period has been extended, during such extended Offer Period, however, always in accordance with the instructions of the relevant book-entry account operator. In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period, the acceptance form shall be submitted so that it is received during the Subsequent Offer Period, however, always in accordance with the instructions of the relevant book-entry account operator. The method of delivery of acceptance forms is at the shareholder's option and risk, and the delivery will be deemed made only when actually received by the relevant book-entry account operator. The Offeror reserves the right to reject any acceptance given in an incorrect or incomplete manner. The Offeror may also reject any partial tender of the Shares per book-entry account.By accepting the Tender Offer, the shareholder of the Company authorizes the book-entry account operator managing the shareholder's book-entry account to enter a transfer restriction or a sales reservation on the shareholder's book-entry account after the shareholder has delivered its acceptance of the Tender Offer. In addition, the shareholder who has accepted the Tender Offer authorizes the book-entry account operator managing the shareholder's book-entry account to perform the necessary entries and to take all other actions required to technically execute the Tender Offer and to sell all the Shares held on such book-entry account at the time of the execution of trades under the Tender Offer to the Offeror in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer.A shareholder that has validly accepted the Tender Offer and that has not properly withdrawn its acceptance in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer may not sell or otherwise dispose of its tendered Shares. A transfer restriction in respect of the Shares will be registered in the relevant book-entry account after a shareholder has submitted the acceptance for the Tender Offer. If the Tender Offer is not completed or if the acceptance is properly withdrawn by the shareholder in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, the transfer restriction registered on the tendered Shares in the relevant book-entry account will be removed as soon as possible and within approximately three (3) Finnish banking days following the announcement that the Tender Offer will not be completed or the receipt of a notice of withdrawal in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer.Right of Withdrawal of the Acceptance In accordance with Chapter 11, Section 16, Subsection 1 of the Securities Market Act, the acceptances for the Shares validly tendered in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer may be withdrawn at any time during the Offer Period or, if the Offer Period has been extended, during such extended Offer Period, until the Offeror has announced that all the Conditions to Completion have been fulfilled or the Offeror has waived the right to invoke them, that is, the Offeror has announced the Tender Offer unconditional. After such announcement, the acceptances for the Shares already tendered may not be withdrawn except in the event that a third party announces a competing public tender offer for the Shares before the execution of the sale and purchase of the Shares in accordance with section "-Terms of Payment and Settlement of Shares" below.The proper withdrawal of the acceptance for the Shares validly tendered requires that a written notice of withdrawal is submitted to the same book-entry account operator to whom the acceptance form with respect to such Shares was submitted. In case of holdings that are registered in the name of a nominee, the holders of Shares shall instruct the nominee to submit the notice of withdrawal.If a holder of Shares registered in the Finnish book-entry securities system withdraws his/her acceptance of the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, the transfer restriction registered on the tendered Shares in the relevant book-entry account will be removed as soon as possible and within approximately three (3) Finnish banking days following the receipt of a notice of withdrawal in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer.A holder of Shares who has validly withdrawn its acceptance of the Tender Offer may accept the Tender Offer again during the Offer Period at any time prior to the expiry of the Offer Period or, if the Offer Period has been extended, prior to the expiry of such extended Offer Period or during the Subsequent Offer Period, if any, by following the acceptance procedures described in section "-Acceptance Procedure of the Tender Offer" above.The book-entry account operator managing the relevant book-entry account or the nominee may charge a fee for withdrawals in accordance with its price list.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period, the acceptance of the Tender Offer shall be binding and cannot be withdrawn, unless otherwise provided under mandatory law.Announcement of the Result of the Tender OfferThe Offeror will announce the preliminary result of the Tender Offer on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Offer Period or, if applicable, the extended or discontinued Offer Period. In connection with the announcement of the preliminary result of the Tender Offer, the Offeror will announce whether the Tender Offer will be completed subject to the Conditions to Completion being fulfilled or waived on the date of the announcement of the final result of the Tender Offer, and whether the Offer Period will be extended. The Offeror will announce the final result on or about the third (3rd) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Offer Period or, if applicable, the extended or discontinued Offer Period. The announcement of the final result will confirm (i) the percentage of the Shares that have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and (ii) whether the Tender Offer will be completed.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period, the Offeror will announce the initial percentage of the Shares validly tendered during the Subsequent Offer Period on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Subsequent Offer Period and the final percentage on or about the third (3rd) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Subsequent Offer Period.Terms of Payment and Settlement of SharesThe sale and purchase of the Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer will be executed no later than on the twelfth (12th) Finnish banking day following the announcement of the final result of the Tender Offer (the "Closing Date"). This takes into account the internal timetables concerning the withdrawal of funds of the Equity Financiers that operate in an investment fund structure. The sale and purchase of the Shares will take place on Nasdaq Helsinki if permitted by the rules applicable to securities trading on Nasdaq Helsinki. Otherwise, the sale and purchase of the Shares will take place outside of Nasdaq Helsinki.The date for the settlement of the above completion of trades (the "Settlement Date") will be the Closing Date or the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the Closing Date. The payment of the Offer Price will be made on the Settlement Date into the bank account connected to the shareholder's book-entry account or, in the case of shareholders whose holdings are registered in the name of a nominee, into the bank account specified by the custodian or nominee. In any event, the Offer Price will not be paid to a bank account situated in Canada, Japan, Australia, South Africa, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China or New Zealand, or any other jurisdiction where the Tender Offer is not to be made (see "Important Information" above), and all guidance from custodians or nominees specifying bank accounts in such jurisdictions will be rejected. The actual time of receipt for the payment by the shareholder will depend on the schedules of money transactions between financial institutions and agreements between the holder and book-entry account operator, custodian or nominee in each case.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period, the Offeror shall in connection with the announcement thereof announce the terms of payment and settlement for the Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offer Period. The completion trades of the Shares validly tendered in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer during the Subsequent Offer Period shall, however, be executed at least within two (2) week intervals.The Offeror reserves the right to postpone the payment of the Offer Price if payment is prevented or suspended due to a force majeure event, but shall immediately effect such payment once the force majeure event preventing or suspending payment is resolved.If all the Conditions to Completion are not met and the Offeror does not waive these conditions or extend the Offer Period, the Tender Offer will be terminated, and no consideration will be paid for the tendered Shares.Transfer of OwnershipTitle to the Shares validly tendered in the Tender Offer will pass to the Offeror against the payment of the Offer Price by the Offeror to the tendering shareholder.Transfer Tax and Other PaymentsThe Offeror will pay the transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale and purchase of the Shares in connection with the completion of the Tender Offer.Fees charged by book-entry account operators, asset managers, nominees or any other person for registering the release of any pledges or other possible restrictions preventing a sale of the relevant Shares, as well as fees relating to a withdrawal of the tender by a shareholder in accordance with section "-Right of Withdrawal of the Tender Offer" above, will be borne by each shareholder. The Offeror shall be responsible for other customary fees relating to book-entry registrations required for the purposes of the Tender Offer, the sale and purchase of the Shares tendered under the Tender Offer or the payment of the Offer Price.The receipt of cash pursuant to the Tender Offer by a shareholder may be a taxable transaction for the respective shareholder under applicable tax laws, including those of the country of residency of the shareholder. Any tax liability arising to a shareholder from the receipt of cash pursuant to the Tender Offer shall be borne by the respective shareholder. Each shareholder is urged to consult its independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Tender Offer.Other MattersThe Tender Offer and this Tender Offer Document shall be governed by Finnish law and all disputes relating thereto shall be exclusively settled by Finnish courts of competent jurisdiction.The Offeror reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer in accordance with Chapter 11, Section 15, Subsection 2 of the Securities Market Act, subject to the provisions of the Combination Agreement.Subject to the provisions of the Combination Agreement, the Offeror reserves the right to extend the Offer Period and to amend the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer (including a potential withdrawal of the Tender Offer) in accordance with Chapter 11, Section 17 of the Securities Market Act if, during the Offer Period or any extended Offer Period, a third party announces a competing public tender offer for the Shares.The Offeror shall have sole discretion to determine all other issues relating to the Tender Offer, subject to the requirements of applicable law as well as the provisions of the Combination Agreement.Important Information regarding NID and LEIAccording to Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) of the European Parliament and of the Council, all investors must have a global identification code from 3 January 2018 in order to carry out a securities transaction. These requirements require legal entities to apply for registration of a Legal Identity Identifier ("LEI") code, and natural persons need to provide their NID (National ID or National Client Identifier) to accept the Tender Offer. The person's legal status determines whether a LEI or NID number is required and the book-entry account operator may be prevented from performing the transaction to the person if the LEI or NID number is not provided. Legal persons who need to obtain a LEI code can contact one of the suppliers available on the market. Those who intend to accept the Tender Offer are encouraged to apply for registration of a LEI code (legal persons) or to acquire their NID number (natural persons) well in advance, as this information is required on the acceptance form at the time of its submission.Information regarding Processing of Personal DataThose who accept the Tender Offer will submit personal data, such as name, address and social security number, to Nordea, who is the controller of the processing. Personal data provided to Nordea will be processed in data systems to the extent required to administer the Tender Offer.

Address details may be obtained by Nordea through an automatic procedure executed by Euroclear.
