But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated (NASDAQ:CAKE) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 34% in three years, versus a market return of about 49%. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 8.9% in thirty days. Check out our latest analysis for Cheesecake Factory While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Cheesecake Factory saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 8.3% per year, over the last three years. The share price decline of 13% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:CAKE Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Cheesecake Factory's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Cheesecake Factory the TSR over the last 3 years was -29%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 27% in the last year, Cheesecake Factory shareholders lost 12% (even including dividends) . Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 3.6% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
