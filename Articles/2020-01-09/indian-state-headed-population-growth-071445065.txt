Gujarat’s Surat (27) and Tiruppur (30) in Tamil Nadu are the only other Indian cities in the top 30.Why Angola had to freeze the personal assets of Africa’s richest womanKerala’s decadal fallThese stats show Kerala is a study in contrasts as far as demography goes.At 4.6%, Kerala had the lowest decadal population growth rate in the country, according to the 2011 census. This is much below the national rate of 17.6%. Bihar had the highest decadal population growth at 28.6%.“Kerala is moving towards zero population growth or even negative population growth,” according to the state government’s Economic Review 2016. The trend has been generally attributed to the state’s high levels of literacy, especially among women.The child population (0-6 years) in Kerala, too, witnessed a negative trend in 2001-11 at -8.44%. The state’s total child population in 2011 was 3,472,955 compared to 3,793,146 in 2001. The child population represented 10% of Kerala’s total population in 2011, down from 12% in 2001.However, the low overall population growth in the 2011 census was a result of negative rates in some districts offsetting high rates in other regions. Malappuram’s population, for instance, grew at 13.4% in the decade till 2011. The highest proportion of child population (14%) was also in Malappuram district. Sign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world’s most important and interesting news.More stories from Quartz:The British flag-waving “grandma” of Hong Kong’s protests says she was detained in ChinaAs India rises in dissent, Bollywood reveals its real heroes: the womenReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhy a Top Trump Aide Said 'We Are Desperate' for More ImmigrantsThe New York TimesHow the US census misses people of color – and why it's so harmfulThe GuardianSlowest-growing states all have a progressive income taxFox BusinessA Mexican Exodus Is Helping Shrink the Population of People in the Country IllegallyThe New York Times'It's a lose-lose situation': Herpes-infected monkeys swarming Florida trigger backlash over plans to purge themThe IndependentBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
