(“Comstock” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: LODE) today provided updates on key components of the Company’s strategic objectives.Strategic Focus, Corporate Realignment and Transformation In 2019, the Comstock Board of Directors approved a transformational strategy focused on high-value, cash-generating, precious metal-based activities, (the “Strategic Focus”) including, but not limited to, precious-metal exploration, resource development, economic feasibility assessments, mineral production, and related ventures of environmentally friendly and economically enhancing mining and processing technologies. The Company has enabled the Strategic Focus with a legal entity realignment that is facilitating both the disposition of non-mining assets while positioning the development of its 100% owned mineral properties (for example, our Dayton Resource Area and our Spring Valley exploration targets) and a number of highly focused and strategic transactions, ventures and partnerships that facilitate the development of our other mineral properties (for example, Lucerne and our other mineral properties located in Storey County) while advancing investments in new ventures, like Mercury Clean Up LLC and Sierra Springs Opportunity Fund Inc., and its subsidiaries, that successfully acquired the Silver Springs Regional Airport and an adjacent 180,000+ square foot manufacturing facility called Sierra Clean Processing LLC. A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6834143a-b3ed-4d2a-bc64-e9dd66e8e007Mr. Corrado De Gasperis, Executive Chairman and CEO stated, “Our realignment and transformation has repositioned the Company to first unlock unrealized shareholder value and then create and deliver new value from precious metal based innovations and developments, including our Dayton resource and the MCU joint venture.”Value PropositionComstock’s foundational value starts with its land, water and mineral rights on and in the historic, world-class Comstock Lode district, and our planned growth is based on Comstock’s exploitation of existing mineral resources, planned resource developments, new, clean-technology-based ventures from its established and permitted platform.
This platform includes the 100% owned Comstock Processing LLC, that has crushing, leaching, processing, metallurgical labs and equipment, where the Company’s clean-technology platform, joint ventures and partnerships identify and enable opportunities for significant value growth, especially in the area of mercury remediation and reprocessing of residual-leached mineralized materials. The following table summarizes the components of Comstock’s announced strategies and a valuation buildup based on the estimated potential, future contributions to the value of the Company for each opportunity (with the low representing the most known and quantifiable and the high representing least known or most nascent): (Dollars in millions)

During November, we closed on the sale of 50% of the membership interest in Comstock Mining LLC to Tonogold and effectively facilitated the launch of Sierra Springs Opportunity Fund Inc. In late December, Sierra Springs closed on its first acquisitions including the Silver Springs Regional Airport LLC and the 180,000 plus square foot Sierra Clean Processing LLC, manufacturing facility, both completed just before last year end. We also regained full compliance with our NYSE listing and further escrowed deposits on our non-mining asset sales in Silver Springs. The platform is now repositioned for tremendous growth and we are starting to close and realize the value of this progress.”Non-mining Asset Sales and the Northern Nevada Opportunity ZonesLast year, the U.S. Treasury confirmed that all of Storey County and significant parts of Silver Springs, NV, had been certified as Qualified Opportunity Zones. The Company owns non-mining assets in these locations, including substantial lands and senior water rights in Silver Springs, NV, and the Gold Hill Hotel in Storey County, NV.Story continuesThese two, adjacent qualified opportunity zones are located on growing, high volume, logistical highways, railways and airports, with the State of Nevada investing over $125 million in the new USA Parkway and the four-lane expansion of Highway 50, all converging in Silver Springs, NV.A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a19a6833-7617-4f7d-bae6-7a1dda2be422Sierra Springs Opportunity Fund Inc. (“SSOF”) was formed to capitalize on the extraordinary, explosive growth of high-tech industries in northern Nevada, and its qualified opportunity zones, and has already purchased the Silver Springs Regional Airport and an adjacent, 180,000 plus square foot manufacturing complex, and secured the rights to thousands of developable acres of land and other assets, including an agreement to purchase Comstock’s Silver Springs properties and water rights, all within the immediate proximity of the Tahoe Reno Industrial (TRI) Center.A photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/76df942f-0267-4c8c-b194-7d0526cf3e8bComstock expects its ownership, on a fully diluted basis, to be approximately 9% of the SSOF.Non-mining Asset Sales and Repositioned Financial PositionThe Company has agreed to sell and escrowed its two properties in Silver Springs, and over 200 acre-feet of senior water rights for just over $10 million and has received an additional $300,000 deposit toward the purchase of these non-mining properties. The closing dates for these sales is now January 31, 2020. The Company has already reduced its debenture down to approximately $4.9 million, and upon completion of the non-mining asset sales, the Company’s remaining debt will be eliminated, plus initial funding for the Company’s planned growth initiatives.
The following sequence of pro formas represents the near-term transition of Comstock’s financial position over the next 6 months, giving effect to the elimination of debts and other obligations, including the Northern Comstock JV obligations and transitioning to a debt free, JV obligation-free, well-funded Company, positioned for growth.  (US$ in thousands, except per share data)  Pro FormaLucerne Sale (50%)12/31/2019

The transaction alone is expected to deliver well over $24 million ($11.2 million in cash, $6.1 million in stock and over $7 million in assumed liabilities) of tangible value to Comstock. The agreement also subsidizes $2.2 million in annualized savings and retains a 1.5% NSR royalty on Lucerne plus future rents payable under a Lease-Option for using the Company’s processing facilities. These agreements are expected to and may deliver additional value to Comstock of $20-$35 million based on Tonogold’s final mine plans. The remaining $5.275 million in cash owed to the Company represents a secured obligation of Tonogold with payments continuing through June 2020. The $6.1 million in Tonogold Convertible Preferred Stock is valued at over $9 million at December 31, 2019.Comstock Processing LLC and Mercury Clean Up LLC During 2019, Comstock Processing LLC, entered into a definitive agreement with Mercury Clean Up LLC (“MCU”), in collaboration with Oro Industries Inc. (“Oro”), for the manufacture and global deployment of mercury remediation systems with proprietary mechanical, hydro, electro-chemical and oxidation processes to reclaim, treat and remediate mercury, and the entrapped precious metals, from soils, waste and tailings.
Comstock and MCU have secured the necessary permits and are beginning to mobilize equipment to commence drilling and sampling. The state-of the-art mercury remediation equipment is scheduled to begin arriving on site this month and the Company is targeting domestic and international opportunities with estimated annualized revenues of $100 million each. Comstock has ownership options for 25% of MCU and other rights that can result in Comstock receiving up to 62.5% of the profits for each of these mercury remediation opportunities. Securing these mercury remediation opportunities could result in profits of $25-$62.5 million, per project, for the Company.
Corporate Update and NYSE Compliance with Continued Listing StandardsLast week, the Company received a letter from the NYSE American LLC (the “Exchange”), stating that the Company was in full compliance with the Exchange’s continued listing standards set forth in Part 10 of the Exchange’s Company Guide. The Exchange specifically noted that the Company has resolved the Company’s previously announced low selling price deficiency. Effective January 3, 2020, the “.bc” designation, signifying below-compliance with NYSE American listing standards was removed from the Company’s trading symbol.
Mr. De Gasperis, concluded, “We are positioned for value growth and we delivered on our commitment to maintain the NYSE American listing standards and we could not be prouder of our commitment to and collaboration with this world-class platform and the regulatory protections it provides for all of our shareholders. We look forward to delivering on our strategic value propositions and updating our investors on all of our progress throughout 2020.About Comstock Mining Inc.
