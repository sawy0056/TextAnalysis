After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put, Ingles Markets Incorporated. IMKTA stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Ingles Markets has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.71, as you can see in the chart below:View photos This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.29. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level Ingles Markets puts current PE ratio below its midpoint (which is 12.35) over the past five years.View photos Also, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 28.85. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.View photosStory continues We should also point out that Ingles Markets has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 10.79, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Ingles Markets has a P/S ratio of about 0.23. This is somewhat lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.51. right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.View photos If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Ingles Markets currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look.
