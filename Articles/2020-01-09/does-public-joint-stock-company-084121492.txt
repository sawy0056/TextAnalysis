To keep it practical, we'll show how Public Joint-Stock Company Lenenergo's (MCX:LSNG) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer.

View our latest analysis for Lenenergo How Do I Calculate Lenenergo's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Lenenergo:P/E of 4.81 = RUB7.04 ÷ RUB1.46 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each RUB1 of company earnings. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.How Does Lenenergo's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. The image below shows that Lenenergo has a lower P/E than the average (7.6) P/E for companies in the electric utilities industry.MISX:LSNG Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Lenenergo shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.It's great to see that Lenenergo grew EPS by 22% in the last year.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does Lenenergo's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt is 27% of Lenenergo's market cap. While that's enough to warrant consideration, it doesn't really concern us.The Verdict On Lenenergo's P/E RatioLenenergo's P/E is 4.8 which is below average (8.3) in the RU market. The company does have a little debt, and EPS growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
