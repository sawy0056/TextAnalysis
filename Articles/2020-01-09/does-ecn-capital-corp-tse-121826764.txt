Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.Some readers mightn't know much about ECN Capital's 2.0% dividend, as it has only been paying distributions for the last three years. While it may not look like much, if earnings are growing it could become quite interesting. The company also bought back stock during the year, equivalent to approximately 26% of the company's market capitalisation at the time. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying ECN Capital for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis TSX:ECN Historical Dividend Yield, January 8th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Although it reported a loss over the past 12 months, ECN Capital currently pays a dividend. When a loss-making financial company pays a dividend, the dividend is not being paid out of profit, which is a concern if the company can't return to operating profitably.Consider getting
our latest analysis on ECN Capital's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. The dividend has not fluctuated much, but with a relatively short payment history, we can't be sure this is sustainable across a full market cycle. During the past three-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.029 in 2017, compared to US$0.075 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 37% a year over that time.We're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. ECN Capital's earnings per share have shrunk at 86% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective, as even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that ECN Capital's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. ECN Capital is paying out a dividend despite reporting a loss; clearly a concern. Earnings per share have been falling, and the company has a relatively short dividend history - shorter than we like, anyway. With any dividend stock, we look for a sustainable payout ratio, steady dividends, and growing earnings. ECN Capital has a few too many issues for us to get interested.Story continuesWithout at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from costs or inflation.
