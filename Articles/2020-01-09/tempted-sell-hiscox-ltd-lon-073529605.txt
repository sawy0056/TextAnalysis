To keep it practical, we'll show how Hiscox Ltd's (LON:HSX) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Hiscox has a P/E ratio of 41.15. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 2.4%. See our latest analysis for Hiscox How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price (in reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Hiscox:P/E of 41.15 = £18.15 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, USD ) ÷ £0.44 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does Hiscox Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (14.2) for companies in the insurance industry is lower than Hiscox's P/E.LSE:HSX Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Hiscox will outperform other companies in its industry. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.Hiscox's 113% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. Regrettably, the longer term performance is poor, with EPS down 18% per year over 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Hiscox's Balance SheetSince Hiscox holds net cash of US$201m, it can spend on growth, justifying a higher P/E ratio than otherwise.The Verdict On Hiscox's P/E RatioHiscox has a P/E of 41.1. That's higher than the average in its market, which is 18.6. Its net cash position is the cherry on top of its superb EPS growth. To us, this is the sort of company that we would expect to carry an above average price tag (relative to earnings).Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.
