Some firms are also engaged in making vaping and tobacco heating devices. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, wholesalers and grocery chains.Let’s take a look at the industry’s three major themes:Strict protocols issued by the FDA have been weighing on cigarette sales volumes. Health hazards stemming from the use of nicotine have led to regulatory whips on tobacco players. Some of the guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. Such stringent regulatory barriers are likely to stub cigarette sales. Moreover, campaigns against tobacco consumption have led to increased consumer awareness, which has, in turn, resulted in lower smoking rates. Such trends are likely to continue build pressure on tobacco industry participants’ revenues. To make up for the receding cigarette demand as well as high taxes, companies are increasingly resorting to price hikes. As smokers tend to absorb higher prices due to their addiction, this strategy is likely to support players in the tobacco space in the near term. E-cigarettes and other vaping products are gaining immense popularity, courtesy of their low-risk claims. In fact, consumers are increasingly taking to such products in a bid to quit cigarettes. Driven by the growing enthusiasm, tobacco companies are making substantial investments in the reduced risk products (RRPs) arena. In fact, RRPs are viewed as products that are likely to gain significant market share. However, the FDA is keeping a close tab on the manufacturing and marketing policies of such items to regulate usage among the youth.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.
