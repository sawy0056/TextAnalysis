In 2019, corporate pension funding ended down $30 billion for the year, with the funding ratio dropping from 89.4% at the end of 2018 to 89.0% as of December 31, 2019.Plan assets outperformed expectations, posting an annual return of 15.66% and a gain of $174 billion. But record-low discount rates resulted in plan liabilities increasing as well, by $204 billion during 2019. As of December 31, the Milliman 100 discount rate had fallen 99 basis points, from 4.19% at the end of 2018 to 3.20% a year later. This marks the lowest year-end discount rate that has been recorded in the 19-year history of the Milliman 100 Pension Funding Index (PFI)."For corporate pensions during 2019, the funded status environment was like trying to fill a bucket full of holes with water – funding levels would rise given superb asset gains but then quickly recede given offsetting liability movements attributable to ever-falling discount rates," said Zorast Wadia, author of the Milliman 100 PFI. "Looking ahead to 2020, many plan sponsors can expect to have a rise in pension expense given the funded status losses suffered by plans during 2019."Looking forward, under an optimistic forecast with rising interest rates (reaching 3.80% by the end of 2020 and 4.40% by the end of 2021) and asset gains (10.6% annual returns), the funded ratio would climb to 104% by the end of 2020 and 121% by the end of 2021.  Under a pessimistic forecast (2.60% discount rate at the end of 2020 and 2.00% by the end of 2021 and 2.6% annual returns), the funded ratio would decline to 82% by the end of 2020 and 76% by the end of 2021.To view the complete Pension Funding Index, go to https://us.milliman.com/en/periodicals/corporate-pension-funding-index.

The results of the Milliman 2019 Pension Funding Study are based on the pension plan accounting information disclosed in the footnotes to the companies' annual reports for the 2018 fiscal year and for previous fiscal years. These figures represent the GAAP accounting information that public companies are required to report under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Subtopics 715-20, 715-30, and 715-60. In addition to providing the financial information on the funded status of their U.S. qualified pension plans, the footnotes may also include figures for the companies' nonqualified and foreign plans, both of which are often unfunded or subject to different funding standards from those for U.S. qualified pension plans. The information, data, and footnotes do not represent the funded status of the companies' U.S. qualified pension plans under ERISA.CisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/milliman-year-end-analysis-corporate-pensions-see-an-overall-investment-gain-of-15-66-in-2019--but-funding-still-drops-due-to-discount-rate-lows-300983374.htmlSOURCE Milliman, Inc.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat Does an Investment Committee Do?SmartAssetSanders Targets Major Executive Tax BreakThe Fiscal TimesBernie Sanders Aims New Tax Hike at Executive Retirement PlansThe Wall Street JournalIntel loses and English wins in a refreshingly simple SCOTUS decisionQuartzCoronavirus fears are clobbering the stock market — is it doing the same to your retirement?MarketWatchBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
