Its turnkey, integrated monitoring solutions include system customisation, installation and operation. Advanced algorithms evaluate data from the various sensing technologies in real time to differentiate between normal and critical trends. In the event of potentially dangerous situations, triggered alarms can not only alert authorities but also automatically close threatened roads and railways as well as warn people in the affected areas within a matter of seconds. All installations include access to an online and interactive data portal, easily reachable via various devices."Areas prone to natural hazards can quickly become devastating catastrophes. Natural hazard monitoring improves the safety of roads and railways, especially when traditional constructive measures like tunnels or dams aren't feasible," says Hexagon President and CEO Ola Rollén. "Geopraevent's know-how is characterized by a skilled and experienced workforce with geotechnical expertise. By combining this domain knowledge - along with its proven technologies and services - with Hexagon's global footprint and complementary solutions, we can offer more customers the early detection and warning systems necessary for protecting human lives."Building off its strong presence in Switzerland, Geopraevent has close to 100 live systems in operation across the globe today, serving federal and local authorities and private infrastructure operators in markets such as transportation, public safety, tourism, mining and energy. Headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, Geopraevent will be fully consolidated as of today, operating within Hexagon's Geosystems division. The acquisition has no significant impact on Hexagon's earnings.For further information, please contact:Maria Luthström Head of Investor RelationsHexagon AB+46-8-601-26-27ir@hexagon.comKristin ChristensenChief Marketing OfficerHexagon AB+1-404-554-0972media@hexagon.comThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/hexagon/r/hexagon-strengthens-its-suite-of-natural-hazard-monitoring-and-alarm-solutions-with-the-acquisition-,c3002857The following files are available for download: https://mb.cision.com/Main/387/3002857/1170894.pdf
