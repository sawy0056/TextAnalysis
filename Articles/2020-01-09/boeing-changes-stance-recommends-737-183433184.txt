As of December, Montreal-based CAE Inc <CAE.TO> had delivered 23 MAX full-flight simulators, a spokeswoman said.The FAA said on Tuesday it will consider Boeing's recommendations during training evaluations of U.S. and international flight crew alongside regulators from Canada, Europe and Brazil.Canada's Transport Minister Marc Garneau, who has leaned toward mandatory simulator training for Canadian 737 MAX operators, said in a statement that Boeing's signaling the importance of such training was "encouraging."U.S. and European aviation safety regulators are meeting with Boeing this week in an effort to complete a 737 MAX software documentation audit - an important step toward the eventual return to service.Boeing shares closed 1% higher on Tuesday following unconfirmed reports that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> is buying the company's stock. The stock fell sharply last month on the 737 MAX production halt.Southwest and American are currently scheduling 737 MAX flights in April and United in June.(Reporting by David Shepardson in Las Vegas and Tracy Rucinski in Chicago; Additional reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal and David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by Bernadette Baum, Bill Berkrot, David Gregorio and Himani Sarkar)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBoeing airplanes boss earns big stock award after strong launch of new divisionAmerican City Business JournalsIBD Stock Of The Day: TAL Education Outperforms Coronavirus Stock Market CorrectionInvestor's Business DailyP&G veteran tapped for C-suite at BoeingAmerican City Business JournalsGovernment leaders talk layoff response and building Wichita’s future to Emerging LeadersAmerican City Business JournalsSkift Forum Europe Preview: Why Ryanair Still Doesn’t Need to Be LovedSkiftBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
