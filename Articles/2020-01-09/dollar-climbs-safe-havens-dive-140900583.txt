The sanctions would remain in force until Iran changes its behavior, he added.Safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc fell, boosting the greenback as the decision from Trump to impose sanctions rather than signal a military response suggested he is seeking to de-escalate tensions.USD/JPY rose 0.68% to 109.17 and USD/CHF rose 0.37% to $0.974.The dollar was also lifted by ongoing weakness in the euro following softer factory order data from Germany, the eurozone's largest economy.EUR/USD fell 0.34% to $1.111.The pound, meanwhile, continued to lose ground against the greenback as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson kept fears alive that Britain could leave the European Union without a deal at the end of year.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen that the U.K will not extend its transition out of the European Union beyond December 2020.Leyen warned that "without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020," an agreement on a new trade deal would be a risk.USD/CAD rose 0.20% to C$1.303 with the loonie coming under pressure as U.S.-Iran tensions faded, reducing the risk of a disruption in oil supplies in the Middle East.The continued uptick in the greenback comes even as some view the world's reserve currency as being overvalued."The dollar is overvalued by about 10% and has been overvalued for the last two years," Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) FX strategist Athanasios Vamvakidis said. "The reason for this has been to a large extent due to Trump's policies, in particular tax cuts and tariffs." The tailwinds from the policies are "now behind us" with further fiscal stimulus unlikely ahead of presidential elections in November, the bank added.Related ArticlesUK-EU trade talks need not be completed in one go: Johnson's spokesmanForex - Yen Loses Early Luster as Fears EaseForex - U.S. Dollar Slips Despite Upbeat Data; Yen Up Amid Middle East ConflictReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNations take drastic measures as coronavirus outbreak spreadsMarketWatchLate-Night Hosts Cough All Over Trump’s ‘Ludicrous’ Coronavirus Attack PlanHuffPostAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPBarack Obama Demands Pro-Trump Group's Joe Biden Attack Ad Be Pulled for Misusing His VoicePeopleCycling race canceled with 2 virus cases, Froome quarantinedThe Associated PressBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
