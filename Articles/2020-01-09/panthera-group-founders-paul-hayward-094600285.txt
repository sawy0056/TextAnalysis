Panthera Group sees the UK, and London in particular, as a place to make long term investments."Panthera Group is in negotiations to acquire a majority stake in a boutique hotel brand based in London with more than 20 outlets throughout the UK.Micky Doherty explains, "The strength of the Thai Baht has seen a slowdown in inbound investment and tourism in our home market of Bangkok and Thailand. While others are battening down the hatches we see this as an opportunity to use our strength here to look at overseas investments. The weak Pound and Euro are something we can make work for Panthera Group.""We are also talking to a small brewery in London," says Micky Doherty, "as we have craft beer business in Asia and we do believe in vertical integration."The Panthera Group, founded by Paul Hayward and Micky Doherty more than 15 years ago, is a powerhouse in Thailand with interests in hotels, property, logistics, law firms, nightclubs, restaurants and bars. With more than 2000 employees in cities all over Thailand Panthera plans to bring its combined experience and expertise to the UK, with strategic partners already in place.Micky Doherty is confident -- "Our friends in London and Paris have been showing us opportunities that we see as both strategically smart while adding real value to the Panthera Group balance sheet."Paul Hayward is even more forward thinking -- "My goal with Micky for the last 15 years has always been to take Panthera Group public. We have this firmly in our sights now. Panthera Group is big enough and with a very handsome balance sheet. The listing will happen in the next three to four years. Expanding into London and Europe is a natural evolution for a group our size. We need to diversify so that we are not hit by the political and economic scenarios that come to all countries periodically."Paul Hayward is excited about what the future holds -- "Bangkok and Thailand have been incredibly good to me and we are now ready to expand out of the country we call home. We will continue our expansion here in Thailand while embarking on a new chapter in the Panthera Group story in Europe."CisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/panthera-group-founders-paul-hayward-and-michael-doherty-announces-its-policy-in-europe-to-broaden-opportunities-for-long-term-investment-300983429.htmlSOURCE Panthera GroupReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextStudents Step Up Protests Against Thailand’s Army-Backed PremierBloombergCoronavirus spread has major champions Lincicome, Lewis fearing for LPGA seasonReutersWyatt hopes Thailand win builds momentum for England ahead of Pakistan clashPA Media: SportEngland delighted to finally ‘put their stamp’ on World Cup, says Lauren WinfieldThe IndependentWinfield: England determined to follow Knight's example after century heroicsYahoo Sport UKBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
