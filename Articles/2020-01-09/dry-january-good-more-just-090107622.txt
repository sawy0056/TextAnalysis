Here's what else will improve if you stop drinking.Kevin Wheeler, USA TODAYUSA TODAYJanuary 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareIf you’re looking to take a break from drinking in the new year, you might be helping more than just your health. Many Americans would benefit financially from a “Dry January,” according to a survey conducted by The Harris Poll for TD Ameritrade and provided exclusively to USA TODAY.And millennials have the most to gain. The survey, which included 1,011 adults ages 23 and up, found that millennials spend about $300 a month on alcohol or about $56 per outing. By comparison, Gen Xers and boomers said they spend $151 and $97, respectively, on booze each month. Dining out plays a big role in these costs, as 58% of millennials surveyed order alcohol or an alcoholic beverage when they eat out.  “With food comes alcohol,” said Lauren Schall, 25, a people operations manager who has been taking breaks from drinking over the past four years. “Living in San Francisco, you order hummus and a glass of wine, and you’ve just spent $50.” Schall committed to her first Dry January in 2016, soon after she turned 21, mostly to detox from the ravages of a rich holiday diet. But she soon found that she was saving a lot of money, too. For Schall, a weekend of drinking could cost anywhere between $300 to $400 on the high end, and $50 to $60 on the low end. “If you make a commitment to not drink, it all trickles down to making smarter decisions,” Schall said. “When you’re not drinking, you’re not going out as much, so you’re less likely to eat garbage and go to bed late.”  Just over half of millennials in the survey intend to take a Dry January this year, compared with 35% of Gen Xers and 23% of boomers.While millennials, ages 22 to 38, are of prime partying age, many tend to live in cities where there are more opportunities to drink and where the cost of going out is higher, according to Molly Passantino, a senior retirement and annuities specialist at TD Ameritrade.Christopher La Belle, 29, is a hair colorist from Cleveland who is doing his second Dry January this year.The sober curious movement: Everything you need to knowDry January: Sober Semester and taking a break from alcoholHe did his first out of curiosity but was shocked when he realized what he had saved by skipping the drinking. He had spent $300 to $400 every month by drinking one to three times a week.“It was easy for me, but hard for my friends,” La Belle said. “A lot of people don’t like to drink alone, so if you’re with someone who’s drinking, they’ll say, ‘Oh, just get one martini with me.”  La Belle shares company with 81% of millennials in the TD Ameritrade survey, who also said that cutting back on alcohol made them realize how much they were spending on it. “We know how much we spend on our mortgage, our credit card,” La Belle said. “But we don’t always know how much we’re spending on a glass of wine, or going out once or twice a week.”According to Passantino, the savings gained from cutting back on alcohol can have a transformative effect on finances. While financial situations differ, limiting alcohol can be a great way to pay off debts or start saving for a big purchase. “If you have an idea of what you might like to spend money on, it becomes easier to say no to that beer,” Passantino said. But for those who are already abstainers, there are similar ways to save, Passantino said. For instance, non-drinkers can cut back on online shopping, or look at their monthly subscriptions and decide whether they need both Netflix and Hulu.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Dry January could save millennials more money than they thinkReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWorkplaces must make room for Muslim women – starting with our toxic drinking cultureThe Independent7 Things to Know Before Booking a Trip with MomBetter Homes & GardensMillennials & Gen Z to Drive Gaming Industry: 5 Stocks to WatchZacksCFP Board Center for Financial Planning Announces Best Paper Winners for 2020 Academic Research ColloquiumPR NewswireTD Misses Estimates as U.S. Retail Hit by Interest-Rate CutsBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
