Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 6.7% of market capitalisation this year. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding RockRose Energy for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on RockRose Energy! LSE:RRE Historical Dividend Yield, January 8th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, RockRose Energy paid out 21% of its profit as dividends. We like this low payout ratio, because it implies the dividend is well covered and leaves ample opportunity for reinvestment.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Of the free cash flow it generated last year, RockRose Energy paid out 33% as dividends, suggesting the dividend is affordable. It's positive to see that RockRose Energy's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.With a strong net cash balance, RockRose Energy investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of RockRose Energy's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. With a payment history of less than 2 years, we think it's a bit too soon to think about living on the income from its dividend. Its most recent annual dividend was US$0.73 per share.Modest dividend growth is good to see, especially with the payments being relatively stable. However, the payment history is relatively short and we wouldn't want to rely on this dividend too much.Dividend Growth PotentialExamining whether the dividend is affordable and stable is important. However, it's also important to assess if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Growing EPS can help maintain or increase the purchasing power of the dividend over the long run. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see RockRose Energy has grown its earnings per share at 80% per annum over the past five years. The company is only paying out a fraction of its earnings as dividends, and in the past been able to use the retained earnings to grow its profits rapidly - an ideal combination.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that RockRose Energy's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. It's great to see that RockRose Energy is paying out a low percentage of its earnings and cash flow. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the company has not been paying dividends as long as we'd like. RockRose Energy performs highly under this analysis, although it falls slightly short of our exacting standards. At the right valuation, it could be a solid dividend prospect.Story continuesYou can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in RockRose Energy stock.
