(JAGX) ("Jaguar" or the "Company"), today announced that a study appearing in the December 2019 issue of Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology, a peer-reviewed journal published by the American College of Gastroenterology, indicates that crofelemer could be a treatment option for abdominal pain associated with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).This multicenter, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the effect of crofelemer on abdominal pain in women with IBS-D. A total of 240 women were enrolled, and participants were randomized to crofelemer (125 mg) or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Following an analysis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-issued revised recommendations for outcome measures in IBS clinical trials in 2010, the proportion of monthly abdominal pain responders was significantly higher in the crofelemer group during months 1 through 2 (58.3% vs 45.0%, P = 0.030) as well as during the entire 3 months (54.2% vs 42.5%, P = 0.037) when compared with placebo. No significant differences were observed in the proportion of stool consistency monthly responders based on the revised FDA guidelines.These observed trends of improvement in monthly abdominal pain responders suggest that crofelemer may have a use for treatment in abdominal pain in IBS-D patients without having significant changes to bowel habits. Currently there are very few treatment options to address the visceral pain associated with IBS-D. Crofelemer has a distinct and novel antisecretory mechanism of action of modulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and/or calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCC) that may provide a new non-opiate or antibiotic-based option to treat the visceral abdominal pain and discomfort for IBS-D patients.Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal condition defined by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of another disease that can account for these symptoms. IBS is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal condition and has a population prevalence of up to 12% in North America and is more prevalent in women than in men. Currently, IBS is a clinical diagnosis based on abdominal pain associated with a change in bowel habits. Patients with IBS, but particularly those with IBS-D, report significantly reduced quality of life, higher indirect costs, and greater impairments in daily and work activities.About Jaguar Health, Inc.Jaguar Health, Inc. is a commercial stage pharmaceuticals company focused on developing novel, sustainably derived gastrointestinal products on a global basis.
