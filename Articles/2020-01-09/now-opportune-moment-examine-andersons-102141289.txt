(NASDAQ:ANDE)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosThe Andersons, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANDE), which is based in United States, saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a small cap stock, which tends to lack high analyst coverage, there is generally more of an opportunity for mispricing as there is less activity to push the stock closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity here to buy? Let’s take a look at Andersons’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Andersons Is Andersons still cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my relative valuation model. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Andersons’s ratio of 22.47x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 22.82x, which means if you buy Andersons today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe Andersons should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond where it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Andersons’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Andersons?NasdaqGS:ANDE Past and Future Earnings, January 8th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
