And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in High Fashion International (HKG:608). Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for High Fashion International High Fashion International's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that High Fashion International has managed to grow EPS by 19% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be smiling.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While High Fashion International may have maintained EBIT margins over the last year, revenue has fallen. Suffice it to say that is not a great sign of growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.First things first; I didn't see insiders sell High Fashion International shares in the last year. But the really good news is that Co-Founder Foo Lam spent HK$1.7m buying stock stock, at an average price of around HK$1.70. To me that means at least one insider thinks that the company is doing well - and they are backing that view with cash.On top of the insider buying, we can also see that High Fashion International insiders own a large chunk of the company. In fact, they own 52% of the company, so they will share in the same delights and challenges experienced by the ordinary shareholders. To me this is a good sign because it suggests they will be incentivised to build value for shareholders over the long term. With that sort of holding, insiders have about HK$306m riding on the stock, at current prices. That should be more than enough to keep them focussed on creating shareholder value!Story continuesShould You Add High Fashion International To Your Watchlist?For growth investors like me, High Fashion International's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. The cranberry sauce on the turkey is that insiders own a bunch of shares, and one has been buying more. So I do think this is one stock worth watching. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if High Fashion International is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.The good news is that High Fashion International is not the only growth stock with insider buying.
