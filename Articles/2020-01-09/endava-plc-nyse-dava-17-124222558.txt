Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Endava:0.17 = UK£37m ÷ (UK£277m - UK£63m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, Endava has an ROCE of 17%.

Since the future is so important for investors, you should check out our free report on analyst forecasts for Endava.How Endava's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCELiabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Endava has total assets of UK£277m and current liabilities of UK£63m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 23% of its total assets. Current liabilities are minimal, limiting the impact on ROCE.What We Can Learn From Endava's ROCEThis is good to see, and with a sound ROCE, Endava could be worth a closer look.
