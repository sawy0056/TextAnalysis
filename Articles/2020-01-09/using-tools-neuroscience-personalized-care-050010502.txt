Gregory A. Light, Ph.D., University of California, San Diego, will be the presenter. Dr. Light will describe precision medicine trials his team has conducted which significantly reduced symptoms and improved cognitive and daily functioning in patients with chronic psychosis in a “real-world” setting: a long-term community inpatient facility. They also found that reliable, easy-to-obtain signatures of brain-wave activity recorded at the outset of treatment can be used to identify which patients are most likely to benefit (or not) from treatments. This work ultimately aims to develop personalized biomarker assessment tools to deliver the “right treatment” to the “right person” at the “right time,” to improve outcomes among the millions of people with psychotic disorders, most notably schizophrenia. Jeffrey Borenstein, M.D., President and CEO of the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation and Host and Executive Producer of the public television series “Healthy Minds,” will be the moderator.
