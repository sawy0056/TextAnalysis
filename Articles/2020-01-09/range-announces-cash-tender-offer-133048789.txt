Holders of Notes tendering their Notes after the Early Tender Date will only be eligible to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration for such series of Notes set forth in the table above, which is the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium.In addition to the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable, all holders of Notes accepted for purchase will receive accrued and unpaid interest from and including the last interest payment date applicable to the relevant series of Notes up to, but not including, the applicable Settlement Date (as defined below) for such Notes.Tendered Notes may be withdrawn at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 22, 2020 (the “Withdrawal Date”) and may not be validly withdrawn thereafter except as provided in the Offer to Purchase or applicable law.The Tender Offers will expire at Midnight, New York City time, at the end of February 5, 2020, unless extended by Range in its sole discretion (the “Expiration Date”).Provided that the conditions to the applicable Tender Offer have been satisfied or waived, and assuming acceptance for purchase by Range of the Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offers, (i) payment for Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers will be made on the settlement date that is expected to be the second business day following the Early Tender Date, or as promptly as practicable thereafter (the “Early Settlement Date”) and (ii) payment for any Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date, but at or prior to the Expiration Date, and accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers will be made on the settlement date that is expected to be the second business day following the Expiration Date (the “Final Settlement Date” and, together with the related Early Settlement Date, the “Settlement Dates”).Subject to the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount and proration, the Notes accepted for payment on any Settlement Date will be accepted in accordance with their Acceptance Priority Levels set forth in the table above, with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 3 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level; provided that Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase with priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date, even if such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date have a higher Acceptance Priority Level.Story continuesAcceptance for tenders of any Notes may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount for any series of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn would cause the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount to be exceeded. Furthermore, if the Tender Offers are fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any of such Notes accepted for purchase.The Company reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount at any time, subject to compliance with applicable law, which could result in the Company purchasing a greater aggregate principal amount of Notes in the Tender Offers. There can be no assurance that the Company will exercise its right to increase the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount. If the Company increases the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount, it does not expect to extend the Withdrawal Date, subject to applicable law. Accordingly, holders should not tender any Notes that they do not wish to have purchased in the Tender Offers.The Tender Offers are not contingent upon the tender of any minimum principal amount of Notes. Range’s obligation to accept for purchase and to pay for the Notes validly tendered in any Tender Offer is subject to and conditioned on the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, including the completion of the Debt Financing. Range reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to: (a) extend the Early Tender Date, Withdrawal Date or Expiration Date to a later date and time as announced by the Company; (b) increase the Aggregate Maximum Tender Amount; (c) waive or modify in whole or in part any or all conditions to the Tender Offers; (d) delay the acceptance for purchase of any Notes or delay the purchase of any Notes; or (e) otherwise modify or terminate one or more of the Tender Offers.The dealer manager for the Tender Offers is BofA Securities.
