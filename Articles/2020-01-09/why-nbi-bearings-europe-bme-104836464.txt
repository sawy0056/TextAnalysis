We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to NBI Bearings Europe, S.A.'s (BME:NBI), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is NBI Bearings Europe's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 29.79. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 3.4%.

All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does NBI Bearings Europe Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that NBI Bearings Europe has a higher P/E than the average (27.5) P/E for companies in the machinery industry.BME:NBI Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreNBI Bearings Europe's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.NBI Bearings Europe shrunk earnings per share by 19% over the last year. But over the longer term (3 years), earnings per share have increased by 31%. And over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have decreased 37% annually. This growth rate might warrant a below average P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does NBI Bearings Europe's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt totals 18% of NBI Bearings Europe's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Bottom Line On NBI Bearings Europe's P/E RatioNBI Bearings Europe has a P/E of 29.8.
