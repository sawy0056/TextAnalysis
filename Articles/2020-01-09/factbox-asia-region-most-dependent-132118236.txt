And an estimated 76% of the 17.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and condensate that flowed through the Strait of Hormuz in 2018 went to Asia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).Asian refiners prefer to process Middle East crude grades as they are generally cheaper than oil from other regions due to relatively higher sulphur levels. Middle East oils also tend to be heavier grades, allowing refiners to further process residue fuel into higher-value products to boost revenue.The United States used to be a major importer of oil from the Middle East but its share has steadily declined in recent years on the back of its own shale oil boom.In 2018, U.S. oil imports passing through the Strait of Hormuz stood at 1.4 million bpd of oil and condensate, accounting for about 18% of total U.S. crude and condensate imports and 7% of total U.S. petroleum liquids consumption, according to the U.S. government.Here's a breakdown of Middle East crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports for each major Asian importing country.CHINAChina, the world's largest crude oil importer, buys about 40% of its crude from the Middle East.
