(HKG:3866) shareholders have seen the share price descend 12% over the month. On the other hand the share price is higher than it was three years ago. Arguably you'd have been better off buying an index fund, because the gain of 17% in three years isn't amazing. Check out our latest analysis for Bank of Qingdao To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years of share price growth, Bank of Qingdao actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 9.7% per year.Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.It could be that the revenue growth of 4.9% per year is viewed as evidence that Bank of Qingdao is growing. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth, and maybe shareholder's faith in better days ahead will be rewarded.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).SEHK:3866 Income Statement, January 7th 2020MoreWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Bank of Qingdao's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Bank of Qingdao the TSR over the last 3 years was 30%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveBank of Qingdao shareholders are up 1.8% for the year (even including dividends) . It's always nice to make money but this return falls short of the market return which was about 12% for the year. But the (superior) three-year TSR of 9.1% per year is some consolation. We prefer focus on longer term returns, as they are usually a more meaningful indication of the underlying business. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Bank of Qingdao's dividend track record.
