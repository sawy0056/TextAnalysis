TrustCall is an enterprise-grade solution that delivers high performance and HD quality encrypted audio and can be flexibly deployed via the cloud, on premise, or in hybrid form.“KoolSpan’s TrustCall ensures that devices use end-to-end encryption for all communication paths, which is crucial to improving the security of global telecommunications networks,” said Jin Kang, WidePoint President and Chief Executive Officer. “By partnering with KoolSpan, we have immediately added a secure communication tool that is directly complementary to our product suite and a critical need for our federal and enterprise clients. We expect this partnership to give us an additional leg up over our competition as we continue to focus on expanding our presence as a leading provider of trusted mobility management services.”Nigel Jones, KoolSpan’s Chief Executive Officer, stated: “WidePoint has a long history of successfully serving both federal agencies and enterprise clients, and by partnering with them, we’re able to leverage their reputation and relationships to serve a much broader customer base.”“Global telecommunications networks are inherently insecure as has been well documented by cyber security experts in the U.S. Government and across the private sector. The threats, from surveillance of communications to theft of IP to corporate espionage, are posed by systemic vulnerabilities in the global telecommunications infrastructure that readily enable interception and monitoring of mobile communications, both voice and data,” said Elad Yoran, KoolSpan Executive Chairman. “The only viable solution to this problem is to use end-to-end (E2E) encryption for all communications. KoolSpan is excited to partner with WidePoint to provide TrustCall.“About WidePointWidePoint Corporation (NYSE American: WYY) is a leading provider of trusted mobility management (TM2) solutions, including telecom management, mobile management, identity management, and digital billing and analytics.
