As a nation, over 44 million Americans collectively owe a whopping $1.5 trillion in federal student loan debt, a number that grows each year and is second only to mortgage debt in America. Upon graduation, those entering the professional world face mounds of bills, a shrinking pool of employment opportunities, a lack of financial skills and the constant, crippling weight of debt.“We are delighted with the tremendous viewer response to this series, which validates the resonance of the student debt crisis nationwide,” said William J. Rouhana Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment. “Going From Broke is exactly the type of content that we believe will continue to make Crackle stand out as a leading provider of free, premium content. We are excited to be working actively with sponsors on a potential second season.”In the original series, Chegg chief executive officer Dan Rosensweig and financial expert Danetha Doe go one-to-one with young people living in pricey Los Angeles, to change their habits, gain financial confidence and become the CEO of their own lives. Although they all come from different backgrounds and circumstances, each of the participants has one thing in common - extreme debt.Going From Broke is executive produced by Ashton Kutcher, William J. Rouhana Jr., and Michael Winter for Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment. Matador Content’s Todd Lubin, Jay Peterson, Joel Relampagos and Jerry Carita also serve as executive producers.Crackle is available on all top streaming platforms, connected TVs, game consoles, Crackle mobile apps (iOs, Android) and at Crackle.com.
