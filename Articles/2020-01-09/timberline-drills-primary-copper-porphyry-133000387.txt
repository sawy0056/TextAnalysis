Reverse circulation ("RC") hole RCEC 19-05 intercepted 305 feet (ft) (93 meters (m)) grading 0.25% Cu, 0.08 g/t Au, and 9 g/t Ag and bottomed in mineralization at 555 ft (169 m) because of limitations of the drill rig within intensely silicified rock. Additionally, three RC holes further delineated a broad area of thick, near-surface copper oxide mineralization at the Valmy Pit target area of the project. Timberline has the right to acquire a 65% interest in the 16 square mile (41 km2) Elder Creek property through an earn-in agreement with McEwen Mining Inc. The Company is actively seeking a strategic partner for Elder Creek.Steven Osterberg, Timberline's President and CEO commented, "The recently-completed drill holes at Elder Creek further define a large mineralized copper-gold-silver porphyry system with multiple intrusive and mineralizing events. We have already identified six priority target areas over only a small portion of the porphyry system. Three of these targets have been tested by initial drill holes, most of which bottomed in long intervals of porphyry-related mineralization. Elder Creek is a unique opportunity for a significant discovery in an active mining jurisdiction with excellent infrastructure."Morning Glory Hill Target RCEC19-05 tested an area of outcropping mineralized porphyry breccia on Morning Glory Hill. The breccia is coincident with large IP resistivity and chargeability high anomalies (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Assay results are summarized in Table 1. The mineralized interval is intensely altered with silica (quartz), sericite, and chlorite and contains from 2% to >10% disseminated sulfides including pyrite, chalcopyrite, and minor molybdenite. Silver has a strong positive correlation with copper values.Copper mineralization in RCEC19-05 and in nearby historic hole 98EC-07 (18 m @ 0.45% Cu, and 6 m @ 0.57% Cu) appears associated with coincident high IP and high resistivity geophysical signatures (Figure 3) likely due to the disseminated sulfides and pervasive silicification, respectively.Table 1.

Valmy Pit TargetRCEC19-02, 03 & 04, totaling 1,470 ft (448 m) (see Table 1), were drilled to offset and expand the mineralization identified in RCEC 18-01 (Figure 1) which averaged 0.21% Cu over its entire 500 ft (152 m) length, including 110 ft (34 m) grading 0.44% Cu. RCEC19-02 contained intercepts of 185 ft (56 m) grading 0.22% Cu and 150 ft (46 m) grading 0.16% Cu, while RCEC 19-03 averaged 0.16% Cu across its entire 405 ft (124 m) length. Each drill hole bottomed in mineralization with drilling terminated due to intense silica alteration and groundwater. These holes extended the footprint of the shallow copper oxide mineralization at the Valmy Pit target area to approximately 575 ft (175 m) by 400 ft (122 m). The mineralization remains open in all directions and to depth, where it transitions to sulfide mineralization.Exploration PlansGiven the magnitude of the opportunity at Elder Creek, the Company is actively seeking a strategic partner to explore this areally huge porphyry system. Only a small portion of the system has been evaluated to date. The three target areas that have been drilled contain substantial Cu ± Mo-Ag-Au prophyry mineralization. Future objectives include offsetting and deepening these drill holes, and identifying and testing new targets.Figure 1.

Elder Creek L3800N Geology and Drill Holes, and IP/Resistivity Cross Section View photosElder Creek Property: Timberline's Elder Creek copper-gold, and adjacent Paiute properties lie within the prolific Battle Mountain District of Nevada, approximately 11 miles (18 km) north of Newmont's Phoenix mining complex. Data compiled from over 40-plus years of exploration on the property includes only limited shallow (typically less than 500 ft (152 m)), historic drilling in the pronounced magnetic low and along the north and northeastern of magnetic high donut zone targeted primarily at gold. Geologic and geophysical characteristics, and rock geochemical sampling results evident at Elder Creek (see press release dated June 18, 2018 at http://timberlineresources.co/press-releases/) are common to major porphyry copper deposits. Three primary target areas have been identified to date at Elder Creek.Further technical details of the Company's Elder Creek project may be viewed at: http://timberlineresources.co/projects/ElderCreek/.Sampling Methodology, Chain of Custody, Quality Control and Quality Assurance: Samples of reverse circulation cuttings were collected at the drill rig at 5 feet intervals under the supervision of a Company representative and transported to ALS in Nevada for analyses. Samples were assayed for gold by Fire Assay of a 30 gram (1 assay ton) charge with an AA finish (ALS code Au-AA23). Samples were also assayed for a 48 multi-element using four acid ICP-MS (code ME-MS61). "Over-limits" were re-assayed using 4-acid Aqua regia digestion and ICP or AAS finish (code Cu-OG62).Steven Osterberg, Ph.D., P.G., Timberline's President and Chief Executive Officer, is a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical contents of this release.
