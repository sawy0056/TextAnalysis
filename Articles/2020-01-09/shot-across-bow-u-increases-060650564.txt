A company spokesman said UK lawmakers had confirmed Huawei equipment would not be deployed in networks used for intelligence sharing."Our 5G equipment does not pose a threat to information security," he said. "We are confident the UK government will take an evidence-based approach when making its decision about Huawei's inclusion in the 5G network."U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to press British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab over Huawei at a meeting in Washington on Thursday, the sources said.Ahead of the decision, Washington had also planned to send a delegation, including deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, to meet with British officials this week, sources said. But the trip was cancelled at the last minute, two of the people said, due to bad weather.Last month, the United States also passed legislation that included a provision bolstering threats to restrict intelligence-sharing with allies that use Huawei equipment.Washington is seen to be "cocking the pistol," said a person with knowledge of the British government's position on Huawei. "What's unclear is how, when or indeed if it will actually be fired."A UK government spokesman said: "The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance. The government continues to consider its position on high-risk vendors and a decision will be made in due course."The U.S. State Department and National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Britain is a key battleground in the geopolitical tug-of-war over Huawei. Officials decided in principle last year to block the company from critical parts of the 5G network but give it limited access to less sensitive parts. A final decision has yet to be made public.A provision of the U.S. 2020 defence spending law, signed by President Donald Trump in December, directs intelligence agencies to consider the use of telecoms and cybersecurity infrastructure "provided by adversaries of the United States, particularly China and Russia," when entering intelligence-sharing agreements with foreign countries.The provision, added by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, was aimed in particular at members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance made up of the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and was intended as a "a first shot across the bow," said a person familiar with the matter.An aide to Cotton said the senator's team is working on a new draft bill that could be released this month and would "significantly restrict" intelligence-sharing with countries that use Huawei equipment in their 5G networks, following through on earlier U.S. threats to do so."I'm profoundly concerned about the possibility that close allies, including the UK, might permit the Chinese Communist Party effectively to build their highly sensitive 5G infrastructure," Cotton told Reuters.(Reporting by Jack Stubbs in London and Alexandra Alper in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler and Elaine Hardcastle)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFed seen cutting rates amid virus threat, low inflationReutersHere are 5 reasons the stock market is having its worst decline since 2008, and only one of them is the coronavirusMarketWatchWhat Would Happen If U.S. Schools Close Because Of Coronavirus?HuffPostKorea Virus Threat Puts Expected Trump-Kim Face-Off on HoldBloombergWorld prepares for coronavirus pandemic; global recession forecastReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
