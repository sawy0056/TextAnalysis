(NASDAQ:HMST) Before You Read ThisSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosThe goal of this article is to teach you how to use price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to HomeStreet, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HMST), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is HomeStreet's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 16.40. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 6.1%. View our latest analysis for HomeStreet How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for HomeStreet:P/E of 16.40 = $33.09 ÷ $2.02 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does HomeStreet Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. The image below shows that HomeStreet has a higher P/E than the average (14.5) P/E for companies in the mortgage industry.NasdaqGS:HMST Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 8th 2020MoreHomeStreet's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Most would be impressed by HomeStreet earnings growth of 11% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 14%. With that performance, you might expect an above average P/E ratio. But earnings per share are down 9.4% per year over the last three years.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.HomeStreet's Balance SheetHomeStreet's net debt is 3.5% of its market cap. So it doesn't have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On HomeStreet's P/E RatioHomeStreet has a P/E of 16.4. That's below the average in the US market, which is 18.7. The company does have a little debt, and EPS growth was good last year. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
