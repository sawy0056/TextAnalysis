The industry growth is attributed to supportive government initiatives to combat cybercrimes and the rising instances of data breaches globally. The growing implementation of disk, email, and mobile encryption capabilities in security suites provided by the cybersecurity vendors to address the evolving threats will augment market growth.  The email encryption software market is expected to hold a share of over 25% in 2026 due to the rising uptake of security software to protect data from malware, identity thefts, and phishing. As email is one of the widely used communication methods used by enterprises, the demand for email data protection software to secure various aspects of email systems including content, media attachments or email access increases. The software encrypts data in transit and at rest and also supports multi-factor authentication for additional security, ensuring that sensitive information is always protected in line with regulatory compliance.Request for a sample of this research report @ https://www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/4484The on-premise deployment model segment held over 70% of the market share in 2019 and is projected to maintain a dominant position over the forecast timeline. The enterprises prefer an on-premise deployment model approach due to the high security associated with managing sensitive data in-house and gain access to cryptography keys for enhanced security. However, with the growing popularity of cloud platforms to store enterprise data due to high scalability and cost benefits, the demand for cloud-based encryption software is expected to accelerate over the forecast timeline.The retail sector will also observe the heavy uptake of encryption over the projected timeframe owing to the need to protect customer data throughout a retailer’s operations. The sector is witnessing a huge usage of third-party services to support online transactions, optimizing customer experience on their websites. This has led to a rise in the number of data breaches, exploiting sensitive customer information such as credit card & bank account details and personal credentials. According to a report published by Thales eSecurity, a cybersecurity provider, around 75% of the U.S. retailers have experienced a breach in 2018 as compared to 52% in 2017, exceeding the global average. The demand for cybersecurity solutions will rise significantly from 2020 to 2026, preventing theft & customer information compromise.Browse key industry insights spread across 260 pages with 269 market data tables and 26 figures & charts from the report, “Encryption Software Market Size, By Component (Software [Endpoint Encryption, Email Encryption, Cloud Encryption], Service [Training & Consulting, Integration & Maintenance, Managed Service]), By Deployment Model (On-Premise, Cloud), By Application (IT & Telecom, BFSI, Healthcare, Retail, Government & Public Sector, Manufacturing), Industry Analysis Report, Regional Outlook, Growth Potential, Competitive Market Share & Forecast, 2020 – 2026” in detail along with the table of contents:https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/encryption-software-marketLatin America encryption software market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 18% from 2020 to 2026 due to the rising number of cyberattacks on the business-critical infrastructure, growing usage of digital platforms among enterprises to conduct business transactions, and supportive government initiatives to promote cybersecurity.
