Results are deemed preliminary as many intervals within the drill holes remain to be sampled in order to define the mineralized zones.Delta completed a total of 1009 metres of drilling in 6 drill holes in late November 2019, testing the Eureka Gold Occurrence.Drilling was carried out on three sections oriented at 160 degrees azimuth and spaced 100 metres apart. The westernmost sections cover approximately 220 metres across strike in three drill holes, the easternmost section covers approximately 175 metres in 2 drill holes and the central section covers approximately 110 metres with one drill hole.View photosFrom north to south, drilling intersected clastic sediments, ultramafic flows and feldspar-phyric mafic flows with sediments and ultramafic flows crosscut by dikes of intermediate composition. All units are pervasively altered and mineralized the same way. Alteration consists of progressive ankeritization and silicification followed by at least two generations of breccias. The timing of gold mineralization is still unclear. Both alteration and mineralized zones are open in all directions. The true thickness of the mineralized zones can't be established yet due to a lack of information.Results to date show a very wide zone of low-grade gold mineralization intersected over 200 metres of strike length in drill holes DT1-19-02, 03 and 05.DT1-19-02 = 106.7 m grading 0,11 g/t gold (note that 17,8 m of drill core remains to be assayed within the zone and were temporarily assigned values of zero).DT1-19-03 = 141.0 m grading 0,13 g/t gold (note that 20,8 m of drill core remains to be assayed within the zone and were temporarily assigned values of zero).DT1-19-05 = 97.0 m grading 0,23 g/t gold (note that the zone is open, up and down hole and 23,6 m of drill core remains to be assayed within the zone and were temporarily assigned values of zero).Complete results are as follows:View photos"We're very pleased with these initial results at Eureka", says André Tessier, president and CEO of Delta Resources. "The alteration is extensive and pervasive, and there's a lot of gold in the system. Our focus now is to look for structural traps or the core of the mineralizing system where the higher-grade zones are hiding."The Delta exploration team is currently in the field, sampling the intervals yet to be sampled. Results will be released as soon as they are available with a more comprehensive interpretation of the mineralization.The property is located in the Shebandowan Greenstone Belt and covers a 17 km strike extent of the Shebandowan Structural Zone which also hosts the low-grade - high-tonnage Moss Lake gold deposit (Wesdome; WDO:TSX), 50 km to the west.Story continuesAnalytical Protocol and QA/QCChemical analyses reported in this press release were performed at SGS Canada Minerals Laboratories in Red Lake, Ontario (ISO/IEC 17025 certified), by atomic absorption method. Sampling and analytical procedures are subject to a comprehensive Quality Assurance and Quality Control program that includes duplicate samples, blanks and analytical standards.NQ-size drill core was sawed in half lengthwise and half of the core was sampled based on geological observations. The remaining half of the core was replaced in core boxes and is stored on site. Drill core samples were bagged and sealed before being transported to SGS Canada Minerals' laboratory in Red Lake.Andre C. Tessier, P.Eng and P.Geo.
