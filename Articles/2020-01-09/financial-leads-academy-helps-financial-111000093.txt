Sounds great, right? Sales prospecting is changing, and finding new clients is getting harder. Most financial advisors still rely on dated "marketing techniques" like asking for referrals (which are notoriously inconsistent) as well as partaking in time & cost-intensive strategies like mailers, cold calling, dinners/seminars (which often attract "plate lickers").Financial advisors today are having a tough time when it comes to marketing and lead generation. One of the big challenges is, the people they work with need to be qualified or have investable assets of $500k or more in a lot of cases. Some advisors will go through almost an entire sales cycle with a "prospect" only to find out, they don't even meet their minimum requirements. Others have to worry about compliance breathing down their neck.Financial Leads Academy (https://www.financialleadsacademy.com/) put together a proven process to help ensure that all prospects are "pre-qualified" before they even receive any marketing materials which leads to better money spent and higher conversion rates. Some of their clients go on to book up to 40 consultations with qualified prospects every month without having to babysit the entire process. One of their primary goals with this system is to give advisors their time freedom back by taking a chunk of the prospecting challenge off of their plate. George L., a Chicagoland advisor reviews; "They've helped me close business almost immediately." Ray G., an advisor based out of Dallas left a video review about how he closed a lot of new business from using the system and claims it was "worth every penny."About Financial Leads AcademyFinancial Leads Academy is a consulting company that focuses on helping financial advisors meet with new qualified prospects across the US.Contact Info:Name: Oliver GrimardEmail: Send EmailOrganization: Financial Leads AcademyAddress: 102 W Main St. Unit 260 New Albany, Ohio 43054Phone: 614-546-7128Website: https://www.financialleadsacademy.com/SOURCE: Financial Leads AcademyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/572420/Financial-Leads-Academy-Helps-Financial-Advisors-Grow-Their-Book-With-Its-5-Step-Lead-Generation-SystemReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSEC orders Wells Fargo pay $35 million for recommendations of high-risk productsReutersRetiree warning: History suggests we’re overdue for a bear marketMarketWatchCoronavirus fears are clobbering the stock market — is it doing the same to your retirement?MarketWatchStocks fell for a third day Wednesday on coronavirus fears — 5 questions to ask your financial adviser right nowMarketWatchJeffrey Epstein had 'no meaningful involvement' with Wexner Foundation, review findsAmerican City Business JournalsBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
