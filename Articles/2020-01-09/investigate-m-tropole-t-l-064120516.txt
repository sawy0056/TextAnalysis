My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is €28.91, but it is currently trading at €16.85 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Métropole Télévision’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta.
