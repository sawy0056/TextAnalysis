Of this figure DKK 13,615,932 constitute dividend concerning treasury shares.4.         Decision to grant discharge to the executive management and board of directors.5.         Any other proposals from the board of directors and/or the shareholders.Proposals from the board of directors:The board of directors proposes that a new remuneration policy for board of directors and executive management of Per Aarsleff Holding A/S be approved. It is proposed to amend the remuneration policy subject to the attached draft with a view to implementing the new legal requirements. The board of directors proposes that the ordinary board remuneration per board member shall amount to DKK 275,000 for the financial year 2019/20 plus a multiple thereof for the Deputy Chairman and the Chairman as well as ordinary members of the board of directors in accordance with the remuneration policy. The Deputy Chairman shall receive 1 times the ordinary board remuneration and the Chairman shall receive two times the ordinary board remuneration, and one ordinary board member shall receive an additional fee of DKK 90,000. The Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the board of directors shall receive no further remuneration for any committee work. The board of directors proposes to reduce the company’s share capital by nominally DKK 4,530,000 from nominally DKK 45,300,000 to nominally DKK 40,770,000 by cancellation of part of the company’s own B shares.If the proposal is adopted, the company’s holding of own shares will be reduced by 2,265,000 B shares of nominally DKK 2 each. These shares were repurchased under the company’s share buyback programmes which were carried out in the period from 20 October 1998 to 22 June 2010 for a total amount of DKK 60,398,000 which means that in addition to the nominal capital reduction amount, DKK 55,868,000 has been distributed to the shareholders, cf. section 188 (1) (2) of the Danish Companies Act. The capital reduction will thus take place at a price of DKK 26.67 (rounded off) equal to the average price of the repurchase of each share of a nominal value of DKK 2.Adoption of the proposal implies the following amendment of article 4.1 of the articles of association taking effect upon completion of the capital reduction:“The share capital of the company amounts to DKK 40,770,000 divided into DKK 2,700,000 class A shares and 38,070,000 class B shares.”The board of directors proposes that until 30 January 2025, the board of directors is authorised with pre-emptive rights for the shareholders to increase the share capital by up to nominally DKK 8,154,000 new shares by changing article 4 a of the company’s articles of association to:"Article 4 a. Until 30 January 2025, the board of directors is authorised, with pre-emptive rights for the shareholders, to increase the share capital by up to nominally DKK 8,154,000 new shares on one or several occasions. The capital increase can be made by cash contribution. The increase may be effected by the issue of class A shares as well as class B shares according to the proportion between the two classes of shares, or – on condition the capital increase is made at market rate – by the issue of class B shares only. If the capital increase is made by issue of both class A and class B shares, the class A shareholders are granted a pre-emptive right to new class A shares and the class B shareholders are granted a pre-emptive right to new class B shares. In case of a capital increase by class B shares only, the shareholders of both share classes shall have a proportionate pre-emptive right to the new class B shares.”If bullet 4 above is adopted, the board of directors recommends that until 30 January 2025, the board of directors is authorised, without pre-emptive rights for the shareholders, to increase the share capital by up to nominally DKK 8,154,000 new shares by changing articles 4 b and 4 c of the company’s articles of association to:"Article 4 b. Until 30 January 2025, the board of directors is authorised, without pre-emptive rights for the shareholders, to increase the share capital by up to nominally DKK 8,154,000 class B shares on one or several occasions. The capital increase shall be made at market rate and either by cash contribution or by contribution of assets other than cash.Article 4 c. The aggregate authorisations of the board of directors pursuant to articles 4 a and 4 b can at the most be exercised to increase the share capital by a total sum of nominally DKK 8,154,000.”The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting extends the existing authorisation to allow the board of directors to purchase own shares so that the board of directors in the period until 30 January 2025 may allow the company to purchase own shares corresponding to a total of 20% of the B share capital, corresponding to nominally 7,614,000 B shares (after the reduction of the B share capital mentioned in bullet 2). In connection with the purchase of own shares, the price of the shares must not deviate by more than 10% from the market price which applies at the time of acquisition.  The board of directors proposes that the age limit for election or re-election to the company’s board of directors is changed from the age of 70 to the age of 75 subject to amendment of the articles of association of the company, article 12, 1 to:”Members may not be elected or re-elected to the board of directors after they have attained the age of 75.”6.         Election of members to the board of directorsThe board of directors proposes re-election of Jens Bjerg Sørensen, Charlotte Strand and Bjarne Moltke Hansen as well as new election of Ebbe Malte Iversen and Henrik Højen Andersen. The board of directors proposes that the board of directors consists of five members elected by the annual general meeting. Andreas Lundby and Peter Arndrup Poulsen are not seeking re-election.Information on the nominated candidates’ background and executive positions is available on the company’s website www.aarsleff.com.Story continues7.         Appointment of auditor.In accordance with the recommendation from the Audit Committee, it is proposed that PWC, Statsautoriseret Revisionsaktieselskab, be re-elected.
