With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Manitou BF SA (EPA:MTU).Manitou BF has a ROE of 17%, based on the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every €1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn €0.17. See our latest analysis for Manitou BF How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Manitou BF:17% = €103m ÷ €625m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does Return On Equity Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. A higher profit will lead to a higher ROE. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Manitou BF Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Manitou BF has a better ROE than the average (8.2%) in the Machinery industry.ENXTPA:MTU Past Revenue and Net Income, January 8th 2020MoreThat is a good sign. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Manitou BF's Debt And Its 17% ROEAlthough Manitou BF does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.45 is still low. The combination of modest debt and a very respectable ROE suggests this is a business worth watching. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Story continuesBut note: Manitou BF may not be the best stock to buy.
