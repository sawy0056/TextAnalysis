The California-based startup today announced it would supply plant-based pork sausages for new sandwiches geared at the breakfast crowd.Placing the plant-based pork in fast-food restaurants will give US consumers who are already familiar with Impossible Foods’ current plant-based beef offerings something new to try. But more importantly, perhaps, it will create a massive testing ground before the company goes after markets in China.Finland’s new prime minister wants her country on a four-day workweekEvery company looking to make sustainable meat alternatives, whether plant-based or cell-cultured, is eying China’s 1.3 billion potential consumers. For those making pork substitutes, the allure is obvious: Pork is China’s meat of choice, making up some 75% of its overall meat consumption. It’s so popular that in 2007, the country created a strategic pork reserve, though just how much pork has been stockpiled remains a mystery.Chicken is China’s second-most-consumed animal protein. That’s good news for Impossible Foods’ chief rival, Beyond Meat, which recently suggested it would soon be expanding into plant-based poultry.Still, as The New York Times (paywall) pointed out, it would be foolish to think of China as an analogous market to the US. What works on one side of the world won’t necessarily find success on the other. In the US, popular beef, pork, and chicken dishes are often fried. In China, by contrast, meat dumplings are often steamed and many people prefer to eat meat right off the bone, not in patties, nuggets, and sausages.Why Angola had to freeze the personal assets of Africa’s richest womanThose cultural differences will be some of the toughest challenges for a US-based company to overcome, especially when home-grown Chinese startups, such as Zhenmeat, are already experimenting with 3D printing to create bones for their meat.But before any US-based startup can toy with the idea of going into such a challenging, massive marketplace, it needs to do its due diligence. That includes making sure consumers respond positively to new products and that it can balance its supply against the growing demand for animal meat alternatives.Impossible Foods is serving up taste tests of its new pork product this week at the Consumer Electronics Show. Starting in late January, it will begin a roll-out of the breakfast sandwich at 139 Burger King locations across the US. Those will initially be in Montgomery, Alabama; Savannah, Georgia; Lansing, Michigan; Springfield, Illinois; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Sign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world’s most important and interesting news.More stories from Quartz:The British flag-waving “grandma” of Hong Kong’s protests says she was detained in ChinaAs India rises in dissent, Bollywood reveals its real heroes: the womenReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergGlobal coronavirus cases rise as China’s downward trend continuesPA Media: World NewsChina's February factory PMI seen at lowest since 2009 as coronavirus slams production: Reuters pollReutersFed seen cutting rates amid virus threat, low inflationReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
