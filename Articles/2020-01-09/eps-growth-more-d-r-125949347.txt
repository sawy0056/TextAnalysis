Horton (NYSE:DHI) Is InterestingSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 8, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosSome have more dollars than sense, they say, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can easily find investors. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton D.R. Horton's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. As a tree reaches steadily for the sky, D.R. Horton's EPS has grown 22% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be smiling.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.8b.
