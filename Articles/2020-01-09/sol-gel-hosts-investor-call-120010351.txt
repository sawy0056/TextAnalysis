Dr. Baldwin is past President of the American Acne and Rosacea Society, a Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson School of Medicine, and Director of the Acne Treatment and Research Center.The conference call can be accessed by dialing 877-282-0504 for participants in the U.S. or Canada and 270-215-9895 for international callers (conference ID: 5779723). The webcast and slide presentation can be accessed live via the Events & Presentations section of the Company’s website at http://ir.sol-gel.com.SGT-65-04 and SGT-65-05 Trials Design To assess the efficacy and safety of Twyneo, 858 subjects, aged nine and older, with moderate-to-severe acne were enrolled in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trials (SGT-65-04 and SGT-65-05) at 63 sites across the U.S. Subjects were randomized at a 2:1 ratio to be treated once-daily with either Twyneo (n=571) or vehicle cream (n=287) for 12 weeks. The co-primary endpoints for both trials included: the proportion of patients who succeeded in achieving at least a two grade reduction from baseline and Clear (grade 0) or Almost Clear (grade 1) at Week 12 on a 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale; an absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion count at Week 12; and an absolute change from baseline in non-inflammatory lesion count at Week 12.About TwyneoTwyneo is an investigational, antibiotic-free, fixed-dose combination of microencapsulated tretinoin 0.1% and microencapsulated benzoyl peroxide 3% cream. Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin are widely prescribed and considered to be highly effective in the treatment for acne vulgaris; however, benzoyl peroxide causes degradation of the tretinoin, thereby reducing its effectiveness. Twyneo overcomes this degradation through the use of Sol-Gel’s microencapsulation technology platform, thereby allowing for a stable drug combination, extending drug delivery time of the active ingredients, and reducing potential irritation caused by direct application of the drug to the skin.About Acne VulgarisAcne vulgaris is a common multifactorial skin disease that according to the American Academy of Dermatology affects approximately 40 to 50 million people in the United States. The disease occurs most frequently during childhood and adolescence (affecting approximately 80% of all adolescents) but it may also appear in adults. Acne patients suffer from the appearance of lesions on areas of the body with a large concentration of oil glands, such as the face, chest, neck and back. These lesions can be inflamed (papules, pustules, nodules) or non-inflamed (comedones). Acne can have a profound effect on the quality of life of those suffering from the disease. In addition to carrying a substantial risk of permanent facial scarring, the appearance of lesions may cause psychological strain, social withdrawal and lowered self-esteem.About Sol-Gel TechnologiesSol-Gel is a clinical-stage dermatology company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing branded and generic topical drug products for the treatment of skin diseases. Sol-Gel leverages its proprietary microencapsulation technology platform for Twyneo®, for the treatment of acne vulgaris, and Epsolay®, for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea.
