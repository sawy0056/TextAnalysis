We do believe that ultimately food will help improve our profitability in the long run," Lim Kell Jay, regional head of GrabFood, told reporters on Wednesday.He spoke as Grab showed off its first so-called cloud kitchen in Singapore, which also has takeaway and dine-in options. Its opening has taken the total number of such kitchens operated by the company to 50 in the region.Grab did not provide a target, but said it would continue to expand its network of kitchens mainly used for delivery. The firm's regional rival Go-Jek has also been testing out cloud kitchens in Indonesia.(Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore; Editing by Jan Harvey)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next'No one cares': Locked-in Wuhan residents adapt to find foodAFPDoorDash quietly files paperwork to go publicMarketWatchAmazon India in Food DeliveryZacksCoronavirus forced Chinese food delivery to evolve.
