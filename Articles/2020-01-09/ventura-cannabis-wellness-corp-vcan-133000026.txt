(VCAN.CN)("Ventura" or the " Company") released preliminary selected quarterly financial highlights for the quarter ending November 30, 2019:Cannabis revenue for the quarter is expected to exceed $490,000 as compared to $402,000 last quarter, representing a 23% growth quarter over quarter.Gross margins for cannabis operations of 33%, as with most U.S. cannabis assets, free cash flow is limited.Management continues to work to dispose of or unwind the addiction services assets."I wanted to provide an update on our third quarter as a cannabis-focused business to our shareholders," said Mr. Chris Heath, CEO of Ventura. "For the third quarter in a row we have seen growth from our core cannabis business and I am looking forward to publishing our full quarterly financials at the end of the month, to be sure it has been a good quarter for us, as all of the growth was organic. We continue to unwind our addiction business units and expect our cash position in the short run to remain steady, however, we remain uncertain of the costs resulting from exiting this declining rehab services market and we are reserving a portion of the cash to satisfy these liabilities.""It seems the entire capital market for cannabis is challenging at the moment. While on a positive note, we plan to continue to deploy our cash to build cannabis revenue, and we are seeing pretty good organic revenue growth rates post-acquisition, like any small, fast-growing public company, we are somewhat dependent on the overall capital markets to continue acquiring aggressively. My hope is now with three successful quarters under our belt, and with no debt, market participants will be persuaded to become shareholders in our fast-growing company and we can finally set ourselves apart from the many listed cannabis companies in distress. Our strength, I believe, is now proven."For more information contact:Ventura Cannabis and Wellness Corp.Chris HeathCEO(424) 372-1123investor@venturacanna.comwww.venturacanna.comCertain statements contained in this presentation constitute "forward-looking information" as such term is defined in applicable Canadian securities legislation.
