OTTAWA, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Jun 9, 2013) -
The public service is an indispensable part of any modern nation-state, and Canadians are fortunate to have one of the best in the world. This year's National Public Service Week gives us the opportunity to once again thank our public servants for their tireless work.It is sometimes true that we forget exactly what the public service does for us every day. In essence, the public service puts the social consensus into practice, providing Canadians with the support and services promised them by government. The theme of this year's National Public Service Week, "Proudly Serving Canadians," thus aptly describes the vocation of our public servants.It has truly been an honour for me to be able to work alongside the dedicated men and women of the public service, who count among their numbers some of the brightest and most innovative minds in the country. Both in the workplace and in their communities, public servants are helping to make ours a smarter, more caring nation.It is therefore my pleasure to extend heartfelt thanks on behalf of all Canadians to our public servants for their everyday contributions to the public good of our nation.David JohnstonThis year, National Public Service Week is celebrated from June 9 to 15.Follow GGDavidJohnston and RideauHall on Facebook and Twitter
