Although listings are 30 percent lower than in 2007, before the financial crisis, the number of sales next year is set to climb to around 1 million, the highest since 2006, as lending restrictions ease.An estimated 900,000 transactions took place in 2013.Asking prices eased 1.9 percent in the traditionally weak month of December, the smallest fall since 2006.JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said an 8 percent rise in house prices in 2014 could spur the BoE into fresh action."If you were to see the same kind of gains next year or something stronger than that, then you would see more action from the Financial Policy Committee which may go beyond fine-tuning at the edges," Monks said.(Reporting by Freya Berry; editing by William Schomberg)
