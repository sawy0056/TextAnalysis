"We have devolved key mobility solutions that are relevant in today's market in order to capitalize on the mobility trend and which could serve to be our leading premium sources for revenue.", said Stewart Irvine, CEO, Imogo Technologies Corp., "The iPad triggered a monumental shift in the marketplace, sparking a consumer-driven revolution. "Bring your own device (BYOD)" programs are transforming the economics of client computing."
