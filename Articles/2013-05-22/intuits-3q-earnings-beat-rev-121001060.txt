Intuit Inc. (INTU) reported third quarter 2013 adjusted earnings per share of $2.87, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.85.
Revenues
Intuit reported revenues of $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up 13.1% from the prior-year quarter and 125.0% from the previous quarter. Reported revenues were within management’s guidance range and were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The improvement was mainly due to broad-based strength in all the segmental revenues.
Product revenues increased 6.7% year over year to $638.0 million, while Services and Other revenues jumped 16.0% from the prior-year quarter to $1.54 billion.
Segment-wise, Small Business Group posted 17.0% year-over-year growth based on the strength of the group’s sub-segments and the synergies from the acquisition of Demandforce in May 2012. Financial Management Solutions revenues increased 24.0%, driven by higher subscription for QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Enterprise and contribution from Demandforce. Employee Management Solutions revenues were up 11.0%, led by growth in Intuit Online Payroll subscribers. Payment Solutions revenues increased 13.0%, aided by customer growth for Intuit’s GoPayment mobile payment solution.
The Consumer Tax segment posted 14.0% revenue growth due to higher TurboTax unit sold and a revenue shift (roughly $140.0 million) from the second quarter. Despite a challenging tax season, Intuit managed to acquire new customers and boost mobile adoption. Financial Services revenues were up 9.0% from the year-ago quarter, led by higher revenues in online and mobile banking, and addition of the Mint business. This was partially offset by the sale of the corporate banking business in Mar 2012. Accounting Professionals segment revenues increased 9.0%. Other Businesses revenues increased 3.0% due to the growth in global business, partially offset by shift of the Mint business.

Reported gross margin increased 160 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 91.4%. Operating margin in the quarter was 57.3% versus 57.7% in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses increased 20.4% year over year.

Our Take
Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. The company delivered better-than-expected third quarter earnings driven by revenue growth. Intuit’s first and fourth quarters are seasonally weak; hence the guidance was not unexpected. However, the lowering of fiscal 2013 guidance, which reflects lackluster Consumer Tax business given lower online tax filings, disappoints us.
We are positive on Intuit’s growing SMB (small & medium business) exposure and believe that the Demandforce acquisition will continue to provide support to the segment. However, stiff competition from the leading payroll solution provider Paychex Inc. (PAYX) in the SMB arena, seasonality of Intuit’s tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy concern us.
Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). But not all software stocks are performing as badly as Intuit. Investors can have a look at Pegasystems Inc. (PEGA) and Progress Software Corp. (PRGS), which have Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are worth buying.Read the Full Research Report on PAYXRead the Full Research Report on INTU Read the Full Research Report on PRGS Read the Full Research Report on PEGA Zacks Investment Research More From Zacks.com Read article on zacks.com
