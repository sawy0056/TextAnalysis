Once these issues are cleared up, they'll begin the tapering process," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York.The Fed's emphasis that it would rely on future economic data made it difficult for economists to guess when its bond purchases might be scaled back."Couch all this by saying the extreme emphasis on the data makes making these predictions that much more difficult to make and subject to change," said Thomas Simons, economist at Jefferies & Co in New York.Recent suggestions from Fed officials that a scaling-back of purchases could begin late this year with an end to the program sometime in 2014 had stoked market expectations for the announcement to be made on Wednesday and the decision not to taper left some economists confounded."The decision to hold off on tapering seems to be related to the rise in rates, which they are now concerned could sap the economy's momentum. Well, rates will back up again the next time they hint at tapering, so will another rise in rates then cause them to pull back on tapering?" asked Omair Sharif, economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.While the Fed's monetary policy committee will meet in October, several economists emphasized the bank was unlikely to announce any cuts in purchases at that meeting because no press conference is scheduled for the chairman at the meeting's conclusion.If the Fed were to schedule such a press conference, it would be taken as a tip-off that the tapering announcement was imminent, subsequently roiling financial markets in a way the Fed does not want to, said Aneta Markowska, economist at Societe Generale in New York.A post meeting press conference is scheduled for the December meeting.There are 21 U.S. primary dealers, but not all of them respond to the poll.(Additional reporting by Pam Niimi, Sam Forgione, Ashley Lau, Richard Leong and Ellen Freilich)
