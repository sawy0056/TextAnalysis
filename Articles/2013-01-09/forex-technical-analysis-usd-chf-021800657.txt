In fact, the former support line extended off of the February and October lows served as resistance last week. Structurally, the advance from December’s low may compose a flat. Confidence is low in the downside due to the 3 wave decline from Friday’s high but a drop to 9281 or even 9114 isn’t out of the question as long as Friday’s high is intact.FOREXTrading Strategy: I wrote yesterday that “shorts are warranted on strength into 9245”. Price is trading at 9240 as I type but the clean 3 wave decline suggests that shorts are dangerous.
