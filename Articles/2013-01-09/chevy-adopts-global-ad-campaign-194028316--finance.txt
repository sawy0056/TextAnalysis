(AP Photo/General Motors)MoreDETROIT (AP) — Chevrolet is dropping its "Chevy Runs Deep" slogan and replacing it with the new tagline "Find New Roads," saying that it's better geared toward drivers outside the U.S.The General Motors Co. brand pointed to its significant overseas expansion over the past several years, noting that it's developing products for sale in more than 140 markets around the world."Find New Roads will enable the whole company to rally around a consistent theme for the brand, and at the same time serve as an external message that works in all markets," GM marketing chief Alan Batey said in a statement."The theme has meaning in mature markets like the U.S. as well as emerging markets like Russia and India, where the potential for continued growth is the greatest," he said."Find New Roads" will be used in the brand's advertising starting in the U.S. this quarter.GM unveiled the "Chevy Runs Deep" campaign in the fall of 2010. The ads drew on the brand's 100-year history and were narrated by movie and TV star Tim Allen, but failed to resonate with customers.Joel Ewanick, who headed GM's global marketing when the campaign was launched, left the company in July.The new campaign also comes after the March hiring of Commonwealth, a newly formed company, to handle the carmaker's global advertising.
