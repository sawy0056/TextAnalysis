But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term Duty Free International Limited (SGX:5SO) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 57% in three years, versus a market return of about 20%. It's up 3.2% in the last seven days. Check out our latest analysis for Duty Free International To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Duty Free International saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 21% per year, over the last three years.

In this case, it seems that the EPS is guiding the share price.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SGX:5SO Past and Future Earnings, January 1st 2020MoreDive deeper into Duty Free International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Duty Free International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Duty Free International's TSR for the last 3 years was -47%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 9.3% in the last year, Duty Free International shareholders lost 12% (even including dividends) . However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 5.6% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
