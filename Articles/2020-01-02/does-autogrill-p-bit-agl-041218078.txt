If you look at the image below, you can see Autogrill has a lower P/E than the average (20.7) in the hospitality industry classification.BIT:AGL Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 1st 2020MoreThis suggests that market participants think Autogrill will underperform other companies in its industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Autogrill's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 116% last year. The cherry on top is that the five year growth rate was an impressive 75% per year. With that kind of growth rate we would generally expect a high P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.Is Debt Impacting Autogrill's P/E?Autogrill has net debt equal to 32% of its market cap. While it's worth keeping this in mind, it isn't a worry.The Verdict On Autogrill's P/E RatioAutogrill trades on a P/E ratio of 12.7, which is below the IT market average of 18.6. The company does have a little debt, and EPS growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
