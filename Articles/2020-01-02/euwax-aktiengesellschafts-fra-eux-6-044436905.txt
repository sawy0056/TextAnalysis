Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis DB:EUX Historical Dividend Yield, January 1st 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, EUWAX paid out 551% of its profit as dividends. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.Consider getting
our latest analysis on EUWAX's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. EUWAX has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €3.26 in 2010, compared to €3.85 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 1.7% per year over this time.Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Over the past five years, it looks as though EUWAX's EPS have declined at around 16% a year. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and EUWAX's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. We're a bit uncomfortable with its high payout ratio. It's not great to see earnings per share shrinking. The dividends have been relatively consistent, but we wonder for how much longer this will be true. With this information in mind, we think EUWAX may not be an ideal dividend stock.Now, if you want to look closer, it would be worth checking out our free research on EUWAX management tenure, salary, and performance.Story continuesLooking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
