Next, they work to restore these properties according to the highest standards and package the land into conservation trusts ensuring they are permanently protected.Partnering with the online auction experts at The Future of Real Estate (FRE), these beautifully restored properties are sold to the general public at unbeatable prices.These now flourishing properties, rich in natural beauty and an abundance of wildlife, make an attractive investment opportunity for nature lovers and non-profits alike, especially with EIP’s promise to conserve and maintain the ecological integrity of the properties in perpetuity.Bill Lange, President of FRE stated, “Finding the right buyers for these unique and pristine properties is a challenge due to their use restrictions. There isn’t a typical buyer per se but we have sold to private companies and non-profits with a variety of interests including activities such as bird watching, veteran stress reduction camping programs, education excursions for school children etc. The people who buy these properties may not be aware of mitigated wetlands or the beauty of these areas and need to be enticed to discover the possibilities.”About The Future of Real Estate (FRE)FRE has over 35 years' experience in transactional real estate innovation, selling billions of dollars in commercial and residential properties worldwide.
