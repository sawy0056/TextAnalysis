In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Design Capital:0.18 = S$9.5m ÷ (S$79m - S$26m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Design Capital has an ROCE of 18%. Check out our latest analysis for Design Capital Does Design Capital Have A Good ROCE?One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. If Design Capital is cyclical, it could make sense to check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.What Are Current Liabilities, And How Do They Affect Design Capital's ROCE?Current liabilities are short term bills and invoices that need to be paid in 12 months or less. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Design Capital has total assets of S$79m and current liabilities of S$26m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 33% of its total assets. Design Capital has a medium level of current liabilities, which would boost the ROCE.What We Can Learn From Design Capital's ROCEDesign Capital's ROCE does look good, but the level of current liabilities also contribute to that.
