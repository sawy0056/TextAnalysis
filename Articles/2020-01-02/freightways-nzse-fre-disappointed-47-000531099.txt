Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Freightways Limited (NZSE:FRE) share price is up 47% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 16%. View our latest analysis for Freightways While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Freightways managed to grow its earnings per share at 8.6% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 8.0% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NZSE:FRE Past and Future Earnings, January 1st 2020MoreBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Freightways's TSR for the last 5 years was 85%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveFreightways shareholders are up 21% for the year (even including dividends) . Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 13% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Freightways's dividend track record.
