But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Aspo Oyj (HEL:ASPO) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 28% over five years, which is below the market return. But if you include dividends then the return is market-beating. Unfortunately the share price is down 4.3% in the last year. View our latest analysis for Aspo Oyj To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Aspo Oyj actually saw its EPS drop 8.4% per year.Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We note that the dividend is higher than it was previously - always nice to see. Maybe dividend investors have helped support the share price. We'd posit that the revenue growth over the last five years, of 4.8% per year, would encourage people to invest.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).HLSE:ASPO Income Statement, January 1st 2020MoreBalance sheet strength is crucial. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Aspo Oyj's TSR for the last 5 years was 64%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveAspo Oyj shareholders gained a total return of 0.7% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 10% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Aspo Oyj's dividend track record.
