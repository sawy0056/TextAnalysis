Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.

Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Brickworks:0.029 = AU$82m ÷ (AU$3.1b - AU$262m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2019.)So, Brickworks has an ROCE of 2.9%.

The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Brickworks has total liabilities of AU$262m and total assets of AU$3.1b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 8.5% of its total assets. Brickworks has a low level of current liabilities, which have a negligible impact on its already low ROCE.Our Take On Brickworks's ROCEStill, investors could probably find more attractive prospects with better performance out there.
