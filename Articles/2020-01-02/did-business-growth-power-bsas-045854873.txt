But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term BSA Limited (ASX:BSA) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 172% in five years. We note the stock price is up 2.6% in the last seven days. See our latest analysis for BSA There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance.

Take a more thorough look at BSA's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, BSA's TSR for the last 5 years was 185%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that BSA has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 54% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 23%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
