With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Ashtead Group’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Ashtead Group What's the opportunity in Ashtead Group?Great news for investors – Ashtead Group is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is £37.87, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Ashtead Group’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Ashtead Group look like?LSE:AHT Past and Future Earnings, January 1st 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 9.9% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Ashtead Group, at least in the short term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since AHT is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock.
