And the full year gain of 27% isn't too shabby, either!Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. Check out our latest analysis for Amino Technologies How Does Amino Technologies's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 13.61 that sentiment around Amino Technologies isn't particularly high. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (16.1) for companies in the communications industry is higher than Amino Technologies's P/E.AIM:AMO Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 1st 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Amino Technologies shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Most would be impressed by Amino Technologies earnings growth of 12% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 6.7%. So one might expect an above average P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.Is Debt Impacting Amino Technologies's P/E?Amino Technologies has net cash of US$19m. This is fairly high at 13% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Verdict On Amino Technologies's P/E RatioAmino Technologies has a P/E of 13.6. That's below the average in the GB market, which is 18.3. It grew its EPS nicely over the last year, and the healthy balance sheet implies there is more potential for growth. The below average P/E ratio suggests that market participants don't believe the strong growth will continue. What we know for sure is that investors have become more excited about Amino Technologies recently, since they have pushed its P/E ratio from 9.9 to 13.6 over the last month. If you like to buy stocks that have recently impressed the market, then this one might be a candidate; but if you prefer to invest when there is 'blood in the streets', then you may feel the opportunity has passed.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.But note: Amino Technologies may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20).If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
