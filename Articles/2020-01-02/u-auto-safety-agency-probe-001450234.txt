The National Transportation Safety Board has criticized Autopilot's lack of safeguards and said in September in its probe of a 2018 Culver City, California Tesla crash that the system’s design "permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task."Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot "enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane," but does not make the vehicle autonomous.Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system. Last month, U.S. Senator Ed Markey said Tesla should disable Autopilot until it installs new safeguards to prevent drivers from evading system limits that could let them fall asleep.NHTSA has previously confirmed special crash investigations in a number of Tesla crashes but until earlier this month had not disclosed the total number of crashes under review. NHTSA previously investigated another Tesla crash that it initially suspected of being tied to Autopilot but ruled it out.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler and Grant McCool)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKobe Bryant jerseys, cement handprints to be auctioned off in AprilYahoo SportsMan held in Wyoming in California cemetery killingsAssociated PressTesla To Install V3 Superchargers On New Jersey TurnpikeInsideEVsWatch This Motorcyclist Chase Down A Tesla Just To Kick ItInsideEVsGoogle Cloud's newest data center opens in Salt Lake CityTechCrunchRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
