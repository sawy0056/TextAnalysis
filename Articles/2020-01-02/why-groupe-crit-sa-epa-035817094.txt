Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Groupe CRIT:0.18 = €131m ÷ (€1.3b - €602m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Groupe CRIT has an ROCE of 18%.
