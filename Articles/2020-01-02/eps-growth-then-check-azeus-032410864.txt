But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Azeus Systems Holdings (SGX:BBW). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. View our latest analysis for Azeus Systems Holdings How Fast Is Azeus Systems Holdings Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Azeus Systems Holdings has grown earnings per share (EPS) like young bamboo after rain; fast, and from a low base. So I don't think the percent growth rate is particularly meaningful. As a result, I'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Like a wedge-tailed eagle on the wind, Azeus Systems Holdings's EPS soared from HK$0.33 to HK$0.52, in just one year. That's a impressive gain of 58%.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Azeus Systems Holdings shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 5.1% to 15%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in my book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.SGX:BBW Income Statement, January 1st 2020MoreAzeus Systems Holdings isn't a huge company, given its market capitalization of S$28m. That makes it extra important to check on its balance sheet strength.Are Azeus Systems Holdings Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Personally, I like to see high insider ownership of a company, since it suggests that it will be managed in the interests of shareholders. So we're pleased to report that Azeus Systems Holdings insiders own a meaningful share of the business. In fact, they own 36% of the shares, making insiders a very influential shareholder group. I'm always comforted by solid insider ownership like this, as it implies that those running the business are genuinely motivated to create shareholder value. Of course, Azeus Systems Holdings is a very small company, with a market cap of only S$28m. That means insiders only have HK$10m worth of shares, despite the large proportional holding. That's not a huge stake in absolute terms, but it should help keep insiders aligned with other shareholders.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Azeus Systems Holdings with market caps under HK$1.6b is about HK$2.7m.The CEO of Azeus Systems Holdings only received HK$618k in total compensation for the year ending March 2019. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance, that arrangement seems generous to shareholders, and points to a modest remuneration culture. While the level of CEO compensation isn't a huge factor in my view of the company, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Story continuesDoes Azeus Systems Holdings Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?For growth investors like me, Azeus Systems Holdings's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. Each to their own, but I think all this makes Azeus Systems Holdings look rather interesting indeed. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Azeus Systems Holdings is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Although Azeus Systems Holdings certainly looks good to me, I would like it more if insiders were buying up shares.
