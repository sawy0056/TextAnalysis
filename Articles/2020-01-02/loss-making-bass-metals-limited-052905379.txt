On 30 June 2019, the AU$14m market-cap posted a loss of -AU$6.9m for its most recent financial year. The most pressing concern for investors is BSM’s path to profitability – when will it breakeven?

They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2020, before generating positive profits of AU$5.9m in 2021. Therefore, BSM is expected to breakeven roughly a few months from now.

This means, large upcoming growth rates are not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments.Before I wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. BSM has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 12% of equity. This means that BSM has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital,and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Next Steps:There are key fundamentals of BSM which are not covered in this article, but I must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.
