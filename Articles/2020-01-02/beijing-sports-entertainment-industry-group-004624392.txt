When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Beijing Sports and Entertainment Industry Group Limited (HKG:1803) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet.

So it can boast HK$122.9m more liquid assets than total liabilities.This surplus strongly suggests that Beijing Sports and Entertainment Industry Group has a rock-solid balance sheet (and the debt is of no concern whatsoever). Having regard to this fact, we think its balance sheet is just as strong as misogynists are weak.
