The trader could be selling a diagonal spread in a strategy that is generally bullish but could also profit if shares fall. But it is more likely that he or she is rolling a short-call trade forward in time. In the latter case, the trader is moving the position to a higher strike at a later expiration date, allowing for more time and a higher profit potential. It could also have been done along with long stock in a covered call strategy. (See our Education section)AIG finished Friday at $44.18, up fractionally but well off the sesssion's lows.
