AirAsia Group chief executive officer (CEO) Tony Fernandes is planning to venture into the healthcare sector in the future, he said in a presentation at the World Capital Market Symposium on Wednesday.The founder of AirAsia said building a hospital has always been his "dream". He noted that hospitals are inefficient, while acknowledging that the more affordable option of state healthcare is insufficient to serve everyone's needs."If we can find something that is a bit more affordable, slightly more expensive that state but 80 percent cheaper than private health, you can take a lot of the state's burden and people will get better service," he said.Speaking to journalists after his presentation, Fernandes said he believes that as the nation ages, healthcare will become a big portion of the budget. He said his concept for the hospital will be focused on affordability.-The Edge----PREVIOUS ITEMS:Kelantan airport to be AirAsia's next hub-Business Timeshttp://link.reuters.com/cyb24v----NOTE: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy.(Reuters)
