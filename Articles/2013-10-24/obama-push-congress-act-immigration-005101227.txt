WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama will use the bully pulpit on Thursday to insist that Congress pass legislation overhauling the nation's immigration system.The White House says Obama will call on Congress to act when he speaks in the East Room of the White House.As the government shutdown was ending last week, Obama said he was making immigration a priority and that he wanted Congress to finish it this year. House Speaker John Boehner (BAY'-nur) on Wednesday expressed optimism about House action by year's end.But it's not certain that Republicans will support the comprehensive approach that Obama favors. The Senate passed a wide-ranging bill in June with bipartisan support, but the measure has languished in the House. Most House Republicans prefer a piece-by-piece approach.
