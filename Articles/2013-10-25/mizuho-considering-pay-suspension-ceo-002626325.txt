The Nikkei business daily said Sato was likely to have his pay suspended for six months while more than 30 senior executives would have their pay cut.Takashi Tsukamoto, chairman of both Mizuho Financial and the core banking unit Mizuho Bank, is likely to step down from his post at Mizuho Bank, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.A Mizuho spokesman said the bank had made no decision on how it would deal with the matter.The measure is among steps the bank is expected to report to regulators on Monday.Japan's Financial Services Agency late last month issued a business improvement order on Mizuho for failing to terminate loans to crime syndicate members more than two years after the bank found out about them.Mizuho has hired a panel of outside lawyers to investigate the scandal. The bank is planning to hold a news conference on Monday, the sources added.(Reporting by Taiga Uranaka and Taro Fuse; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Dean Yates)
