Call buyers stubbornly returned to EMC yesterday, even through the cloud-computing stock has lagged the rest of the market.Option traders looked for upside in the June contracts, snapping up almost 16,000 of the 24 calls, with the largest block priced for $0.25, according to optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker monitoring program. The volume was almost triple the strike's open interest before the session began, indicating fresh activity.Those long calls lock in the price where the stock can be bought no matter how far it might rise. They can provide some nice leveraged gains from even a small pop in the share price over the next month. (See our Education section)EMC fought back from earlier losses after the calls hit and closed the session up 0.09 percent to $23.02, but it is still down about 10 percent in the last two months. Management also appears at the JP Morgan Technology, Media and Telecom conference this morning, so those buyers are apparently hoping for some positive comments.Overall EMC calls totaled 25,000 versus just 5,000 puts, a reflection of the day's bullish sentiment.(A version of this post appeared on InsideOptions Pro yesterday.)More From optionMONSTER Bulls take the wheel with Con-WayWill Supervalu live up to its name?Renren bulls undeterred by decline
