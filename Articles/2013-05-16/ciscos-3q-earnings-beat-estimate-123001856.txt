Both the top and bottom-line results exceeded the prior-year figures.It is apparent that Cisco’s focus on various growth businesses including cloud computing, mobile, data center, and others is paying off. Additionally, Cisco’s strategy of pursuing growth opportunities in international markets has helped to deliver positive results. Cisco is already the best entrenched company across the world and despite growing competition from several smaller players, the company appears to be holding its own.Story continuesOrder growth in the last quarter was quite encouraging and the trend is reflective of Cisco’s superior strategy and innovation. Increasing strength in data center and wireless businesses will help to maintain the company’s strength.Additionally, the focus on new products and acquisitions resulted in continued market share gains. In this quarter, the company completed the divestiture of Linksys, continued NDS integration and announced two more acquisitions in order to deliver top-line growth and profitability.Others like Hewlett Packard Company (HPQ) and the Chinese company Huawei have manufacturing operations in low-cost countries, which make them more competitive. They are also interested in sacrificing margins for market share gains. This remains a major concern for Cisco in the near term.Currently, Cisco carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
