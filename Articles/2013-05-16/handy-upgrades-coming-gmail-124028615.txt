The quick actions are rolling out over the next few weeks. Another exciting feature is the ability to send money through Gmail, thanks to a new integration with Google Wallet. As long as your bank account is linked to Google Wallet or you have Google Wallet credit, you can send money for free to friends and family. Google plans to roll out this feature "over the coming months" to U.S.-based Gmail users over the age of 18.More From Business Insider Google Just Massively Upgraded Its Core Search Product With Google Now For DesktopGoogle Just Announced Photo-Editing Features For Google+ That Put Facebook To ShameGoogle Just Gave Attendees Of Its I/O Conference A New Pixel Laptop
