Coca-Cola Enterprises posted a record-high close yesterday, and one investor is repositioning for even more gains.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker system shows that a trader sold 1,628 May 39 calls for $0.28 and bought the same number of June 40 calls for $0.38. Volume was below the previous open interest in the May strike but above it in the June contracts. This indicates that the trader is closing the nearer-dated contracts, which expire at the end of tomorrow's session, and is opening a new long-call position in June. That provides another month for the trade to work, and the higher strike means that the investor believes that the stock will continue to rise above $40.
