Sigma-Aldrich is already at all-time highs, but some traders apparently believe that the life-sciences and technology company will reach even more record levels. More than 1,700 July 85 calls traded in a strong buying pattern yesterday as premiums more than doubled from $0.45 to $1.05, according to optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker system.

Shares have been rising sharply since bouncing off their 200-day moving average around $74 a month ago.The long calls bought yesterday are looking for SIAL to rise above $85 by mid-July. These options lock in the price where traders can buy the stock no matter how far it might climb, but they will expire worthless if the shares remain below that strike price.
