CHICAGO (AP) -- Silver and gold miner Coeur Mining on Sunday said it will buy the Canadian company Global Royalty Corp., for $23.8 million in cash and stock, and created a new subsidiary to hold royalty-producing mining assets.Global Royalty, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, holds precious metals royalty interests in mines in Mexico and Ecuador. Coeur will pay $300,000 in cash and the rest in newly issued Coeur common shares, which represents a 2.1 percent increase in Coeur's outstanding shares.Mark Kucher, President and CEO of Global Royalty and the firm's largest shareholder, will join Coeur as managing director.The new unit is called Coeur Capital, and it will hold assets such as interests in mines that produce royalties. That will separate those assets from mines the company operates, in a move the company said will provide shareholders with steadier cash flow and diversify its exposure to metals.Coeur is the largest U.S.-based primary silver producer and also produces gold from mines in Mexico, Bolivia, Nevada and Alaska.Shares closed Friday at $10.71, down more than 56 percent since the start of the year.
