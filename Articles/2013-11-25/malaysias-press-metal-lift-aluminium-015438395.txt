KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Malaysia's biggest aluminium maker Press Metal Bhd expects output to rise 36 percent to 410,000 tonnes next year after restarting one of its two plants, a company executive said on Monday.A subsidiary of Kuala Lumpur-listed Press Metal in June reported the sudden shutdown of its 110,000 tonnes-per-year smelter in the Mukah district of eastern Sarawak state due to a six-hour power outage.The firm expects the plant to hit its full capacity within the next 3 months after restarting earlier this month, said the executive, who declined to be identified as she is not authorised to speak with media.Samalaju in Sarawak, the company's other plant, started operations in the final quarter of 2012 and is now running at its full annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes, she told Reuters.Shares of Press Metal had climbed 0.41 percent to 2.42 ringgit a share by 0109 GMT, outperforming the benchmark index's 0.21-percent gain.
