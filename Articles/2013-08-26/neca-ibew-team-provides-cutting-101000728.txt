SUGAR LAND, TX--(Marketwired - Aug 26, 2013) - Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- As building owners and developers become increasingly aware of the need to save power and provide comfortable and pleasant work and living environments for their tenants, much more thought is being given to lighting control systems.Innovative lighting systems not only provide stylish ways to present lighting, but also can reduce power consumption, helping the environment and customers' pocketbooks.In New York State, the NECA-IBEW team has established a program to train electrical apprentices and journeymen in the installation of these systems, thanks in part to a grant from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The program is being implemented at the NECA/IBEW Joint Apprenticeship and Training Centers in the state, providing some of the best training available for installation of these cutting-edge systems.Scott Kessler, project manager at NYSERDA, says, "We will work to develop a workforce so that there's electricians out there who actually know about these technologies, they can install them properly and can eventually down the road put them down in the code."In this edition of ElectricTV, learn more about how the NECA-IBEW team is staying one step ahead of the game and providing the best training available for the installation of these new and innovative lighting control systems.The National Electrical Contractors Association, or NECA, has provided more than a century of service to the $130 billion electrical construction industry that brings power, light, and communication technology to buildings and communities across the United States. NECA's national and 119 local chapters advance the industry through advocacy, education, research, and standards development.The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, or IBEW, represents approximately 725,000 members who work in a wide variety of fields, including utilities, construction, telecommunications, broadcasting, manufacturing, railroads and government. The IBEW has members in both the United States and Canada and stands out among the American unions in the AFL-CIO because it is among the largest and has members in so many skilled occupations.Industrial Info Resources (IIR), with global headquarters in Sugar Land, Texas, and eight offices outside of North America, is the leading provider of global market intelligence specializing in the industrial process, heavy manufacturing and energy markets.
