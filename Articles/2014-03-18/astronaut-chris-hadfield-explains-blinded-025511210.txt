But without gravity, those tears don't fall; they just bubbled up and spread over his other eye. "Now I was completely blind outside of the spaceship," he said. "If you are outside on a spacewalk and blinded," he said, "it would make you nervous and worried." B ecause of all his training and preparation, however, the astronaut said he stayed completely calm. "Our natural panicky reaction doesn't happen," he said, "even if you are blinded."Hadfield was confident in his crew and his capabilities, so the ground crew let him keep working. He eventually stopped tearing up and regained his sight. "Now we use Johnson's No More Tears," Hadfield said of the new anti-fog mixture. "We probably should have been using [that] since the beginning."More From Business Insider Astronaut Chris Hadfield Explains How To Conquer Your Worst FearsAstronaut Chris Hadfield: In Space, There Is No Problem So Bad You Can't Make It WorseThis Head-Spinning Video Zooms Through A 3D Simulation Of The Universe
