Default triggers fear of deepening China housing crisisMoreChina's property sector is the main threat to the stability of the world's number-two economy, say economists, amid slowing growth in home prices and reports that a large mainland property developer is unable to repay its bank loans."As demand slows, more and more developers will feel financial strain. I'm concerned the default will trigger a string of similar distressed situations across weaker companies in the property sector," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist and strategist at Credit Agricole."Banks are heavily exposed to the property sector, so if there are a large number of defaults, banks would have set aside more funds for bad loans and would likely have to slow credit expansion.

Third and fourth-tier cities accounted for 67 percent of housing under construction in China last year, according to Nomura."This risk does not seem fully recognized in the market partly because data are not readily available for these cities, and some investors may be misled by the boom in first-tier cities," Zhang said. Nationwide, residential floor space per registered urban resident is forecast to have reached 37 square meters by 2013, compared with 35 in Japan and 33 in U.K., according to Nomura.
