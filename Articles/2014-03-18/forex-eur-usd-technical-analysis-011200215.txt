Negative RSI divergence continues to warn of ebbing upside momentum but confirmation of reversal is absent. Breaking support in the 1.3800-31 area, marked by a former double top and a channel bottom, exposes the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at 1.3680. Alternatively, a move above the 23.6% Fib expansion at 1.3960 aims for the channel top at 1.3993.Our big-picture fundamental outlook continues to favor Euro weakness but we will continue to stand aside absent a defined sell signal, preferring to see a close below the channel floor to enter a short position.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer.
