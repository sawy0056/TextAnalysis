The VSA system can suddenly apply the brakes without illuminating the brake lights, increasing the risk of a crash."An updated yaw sensor will be installed in affected Odyssey vehicles to remedy the error in the VSA software," Honda said in a press release. "However, the yaw sensor will not be available until spring of 2014."As a stop-gap measure Honda will send letters to vehicle owners describing the steps needed to ensure the VSA system is properly calibrated when the vehicle is restarted.Honda will send a second letter to owners once the sensors are available next year.(Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman; editing by Jackie Frank)
