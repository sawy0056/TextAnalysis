Update: This Reddit post gave me a chuckle this morning and is a play on words from the post title to the covers of two papers.There's an old rumor that Marines will lie about everything to increase their odds of spending time with the comeliest girls on shore leave. With only so many interested females to meet, the Marines ruin the Sailors' chances with unforgivable tales of their Navy-inspired aberrations. That's only what I heard, but along with the headline, the photo offered up a solid Reddit chuckle this Sunday, before coffee.These are covers of Gannett's Military Times papers sold at U.S. military bases worldwide, and for generations they offered troops an outside look at the service. But even in this closed-off environment, times have changed. The following are comments threads outlining the shifting face of media, even in the military.tattedsybotAll of those military "news" papers are becoming tabloids. They run some sensationalist headline about how your uniform will spontaneously combust, you're not getting paid this year, or that everyone is getting kicked out and the military is starting from scratch. It's nothing but "Oh my god you HAVE to buy this paper! If you don't you might DIE!" Once in a while an issue will actually have some valuable information but mostly those are as trustworthy as the National Enquirer.barface911 Yep, they barley struggle to find half decent news to post just to make a quick 6 bucks. I mean who the f**k pays 6 dollars for a newspaper when you can just read about the same information online?I wonder how many times that question's been asked in the last 10 years?More From Business Insider The Blimp That May Change World Travel Is Ready To Fly [PHOTOS]A Message From The Warrior Class To Senator Feinstein On Her Gun Control BillThe World's Largest Naval Station Is Packed Tight For Christmas
