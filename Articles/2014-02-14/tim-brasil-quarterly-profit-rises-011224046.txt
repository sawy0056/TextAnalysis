SAO PAULO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - TIM Participaçoes SA , Brazil's second-largest wireless phone company, posted a larger-than-expected profit on Thursday as investments in fiber optic lines helped bring down network rental costs.Fourth-quarter profit at the Brazilian unit of Telecom Italia rose 8 percent from a year earlier to 499 million reais ($207 million), beating an average estimate of 427 million reais in a Reuters survey.Still, revenue rose less than expected, advancing largely on sales of loss-leading smartphones in a trend underscoring the competitive pressures and economic headwinds in Brazil.Net revenue rose just 3 percent from a year earlier, half as much as expected and half the pace of consumer inflation. Service revenue increased less than 1 percent, while handset sales jumped 19 percent.TIM managed to hold back operating costs in spite of swelling payrolls and administrative overhead, thanks to recent investments in the backbone of its high-speed data network by the TIM Fiber division. As a result, network and interconnection costs, the largest category of operating expenses, fell 7 percent from a year ago.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operating profit known as EBITDA, rose 5 percent to 1.499 billion reais, above an average estimate of 1.39 billion reais.
