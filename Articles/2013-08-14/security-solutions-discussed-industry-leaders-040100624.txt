RYE BROOK, NY--(Marketwired - Aug 14, 2013) - ImageWare Systems, Inc. (
OTCQB :
IWSY ) and Deutsche Telecom (
OTCQX :
DTEGY )HP Enterprise ServicesMr. Steve Lazerowich, Director, Cybersecurity Solutioning, HP Enterprise Services, U.S. Public Sector, told us, "Today, there is simply no way to provide 100% protection. As events have recently shown, it's not just the bad guys on the outside trying to gain access to your information; organizations must also be mindful of the insider threat. The best approach is defense in depth, or in other words, a multi-layered approach to protecting systems. It starts at the outer most perimeter with firewalls and network intrusion prevention systems. Systems need to be segregated on separate network segments so that a failure in one area does not expose all systems. Servers also need their own end point protection including host intrusion detection, malware protection, data encryption and white listing technology."For the complete interview with Steve Lazerowich, please click here.

In order to achieve that, T-Systems was one of the first Outsourcers to produce a 'Cloud' platform, based on highly shared leveraged infrastructure, and with a number of pre-defined applications on top of that. Today we have enhanced that infrastructure, and wrapped the Cloud functionality into it, all the way up to self-service (to application level) for our Private Cloud clients.

These devices have common MIBs that contain attributes relevant for network communication over SNMP.There is currently no standard MIB guidance for security manufacturers to incorporate into their network devices, so SIA Standards intends to develop a set of industry-wide MIBS, which would increase both the security and the reliability of network-based security equipment.An ad-hoc SIA Standards Subcommittee chaired by Ray Coulombe, managing director of SecuritySpecifiers.com, will begin work on this project in August.Learn About Near Field Communications (NFC)SIA and Security Systems News teamed up to present the latest installment of their emerging technology webcast series, which focused on NFC applications. What is NFC? How is it used inside and outside of security? And how may it be used for security applications outside of access control down the road?NFC is one of the latest technologies to influence physical security. More than 300 million NFC-enabled mobile devices are projected to sell in 2013 alone. NFC has already been deployed in some well-publicized pilot programs in the physical security space where smartphones have been used for access control including college campuses, hotels and apartment complexes.Learn about present-day NFC security solutions and what's next in line for the technology with this FREE archived webcast, starting Aug. 6 (http://www.securityindustry.org/Pages/IndustryEvents/SIA-Security-Technology-Webcast-Series.aspx).Read SIA Technology InsightsSIA Technology Insights provides original, exclusive, vendor-neutral analyses of the latest security technologies written by industry leaders. Produced with the end-user in mind, the publication is intended to help chief security officers, security directors and others learn about technological developments and trends and identify possible security solutions for their enterprises.The first edition, which contains articles focused on the transition to IP within the industry, was released as a printed volume in June 2013. End-users and SIA members may obtain a complimentary copy by contacting Ron Hawkins, SIA's manager of member information and partnerships, at rhawkins@securityindustry.org.
