Best Buy has gone on a surprising run this year, and one trader is betting that it has a bit more to go.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker system shows that a trader bought 2,500 April 22 calls for $0.73 and sold 5,000 April 24 calls for the bid price of $0.24. This is a new call spread, as the volume was well above the previous open interest of fewer than 500 contracts at each strike. The call vertical , also known as a ratio spread because one strike saw twice as many contracts trade as the other, cost $0.25 to open. That is the maximum potential loss with BBY anywhere below $22, while the maximum gain would be realized with shares up at $24. Above that level, the faces the obligation to sell shares at that price. (See our Education section)BBY gained 3.3 percent yesterday to finish at $20.96, its highest close since early July. The electronics retailer was at a 13-year low of $11.20 at the end of 2012 and has not closed above $24 in a year.
