I sold EURSEK at 8.7315 expecting Risksbank to shift to a neutral monetary policy stance in 2013. I added to the position at 8.6409 as a corrective rebound launched in early January faltered. Positioning now warns of a bounce, which I will treat as an opportunity to add to the trade. Near-term resistance is at 8.3641.I also continue to hold short GBPUSD at 1.5662. My latest revised objective at 1.4963 has been overcome and I will now look for a push below 1.4861 to expose 1.4775.Finally, I have added a long AUD/USD position at 1.0238 and continue to hold the trade as prices test my initial target at 1.0365. A daily close above this boundary will prompt me to revise the stop-loss to the breakeven level and look for the next objective at 1.0412.--- Written by Ilya Spivak, Currency Strategist for Dailyfx.comTo contact Ilya, e-mail ispivak@dailyfx.com.
