LIGHTER DEVICE, FATTER PROFIT: Apple's iPad Air costs the company less to make than the preceding version of the tablet computer, according to estimates released Tuesday by the research firm IHS Inc. The savings generated by the thinner and lighter iPad Air could help Apple Inc. reverse a recent earnings slump.BREAKING IT DOWN: An iPad Air that sells for $499 costs Apple $274 to make, based on ISH's analysis. That's a 13 percent decrease from the third-generation iPad introduced last year.CHALLENGES AHEAD: Consumers still might eschew the iPad Air in favor of an iPad Mini selling for as little as $299.
