Based on discussions I have had, it gives me confidence that mergers are not going to stop," he said.Even if BDO and Grant Thornton merged, their combined revenues would be half that of the smallest of the Big Four."If I look at the size of the Big Four, it's not realistic to suppose we will reach that size. We don't want to be a copy of the Big Four but to be a strong alternative," he said.Concerns over the dominance and length of time the Big Four have audited the books of banks prompted the European Union to propose that top companies change accountants regularly - a step U.S. lawmakers have rejected.Negotiations on the law are edging towards a deal, possibly as soon as next week, which would mean companies having to switch accounting firm about once a decade.Van Roekel said this would offer opportunities to mid-tier firms but real change would take years. Britain has put pressure on firms to switch accountants but so far the changes have been between the Big Four."We can't sit and wait for the market to pick this up. We have to be active ourselves and make sure we demonstrate we can handle those big clients," van Roekel said.The industry is monitoring closely plans by KPMG and EY to merge operations in Denmark, an unusual move given the fierce rivalry between the Big Four."It's going to have a serious impact on that market. We don't know the real reason why they are merging," he said.(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Susan Fenton)
