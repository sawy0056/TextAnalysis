That marks a fifth straight month of gains, and the biggest year-on-year growth since November 2008.Prices of 241 products in the index rose in annual terms in October, while prices of 211 items fell. It was the first time since May 2009 that price rises outnumbered falls."We see price hikes spreading beyond energy and price declines shrinking with more and more goods," a government official told reporters.The so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.3 percent in October from a year earlier. It was the first rise in the series in five years, and the fastest increase since August 1998.Economics Minister Akira Amari said the figures showed clear progress in the battle against deflation, but Finance Minister Taro Aso sounded more cautious, saying one month of data could not confirm a price trend.POSITIVE MOVEIndustrial output rose 0.5 percent in October from September, a second straight monthly rise but below the median rise of 2.0 percent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.Manufacturers forecast output would rise 0.9 percent in November and 2.1 percent in December, suggesting strength in factory activity through the end of the year.In a sign the economic upturn is gaining traction, the jobs market firmed up and household spending continued a recovery trend in October, albeit moderately.The jobless rate held steady at 4.0 percent and the jobs-to-applicants ratio rose more than expected to 0.98 in October, its highest since December 2007, meaning nearly one job is available per job seeker, government data showed.Separate data showed household spending rose 0.9 percent in October from a year earlier in price-adjusted real terms as consumers bought items such as cars before the sales tax rises to 8 percent next April from 5 percent currently.The economy slowed in the July-September quarter as exports and household spending moderated, but economists expect growth to accelerate this quarter.(Editing by John Mair)
