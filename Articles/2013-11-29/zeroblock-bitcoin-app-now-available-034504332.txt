The popular Bitcoin iOS App integrating real time market data and news for serious Bitcoiners is now available on Android.November 28th, 2013 /MarketersMedia/ -- ZeroBlock today announced the launch of their Android app, which was previously exclusive to iOS devices. ZeroBlock, which combines real time Bitcoin market data with an aggregated news feed, gives users a platform for instant access to everything happening on the Bitcoin market in real time. Since the company`s launch in May 2013, ZeroBlock has become the highest rated and most reviewed Bitcoin-related app in Apple`s app store.ZeroBlock recently broke 1,000,000 total app sessions and in recent weeks has been opened 30,000 - 50,000 times daily by users. ZeroBlock`s news aggregator scrapes from over 130 sources including reddit, bitcointalk forums, company blogs, mainstream news, and exchange blogs. Real time price quotes are provided from BitStamp, Mt.Gox, Btc-e, btcchina, and Coinbase. Blockchain information is provided from the popular wallet service, blockchain.info. Other features provided on the app include a personal holdings calculator, Clark Moody charts, and the ability to share news feed articles via Facebook, Twitter, and e-mail.ZeroBlock`s co-founders, Dan Held and Kevin Johnson, built the app out of their frustration in keeping up with the Bitcoin markets on their mobile devices. During the April price spike, they had difficulty finding mobile apps that would display the live price and relevant news feeds. So they decided to create exactly what they wanted. They built an app from scratch that would emphasize simplicity, usability, and aesthetics. Read a few reviews and you`ll see the type of dedicated fan base they have. Dan Held, "I wanted to keep a strong focus on bringing simplicity to complexity, maximizing the data to pixel ratio" said Held, on his thought process when designing the app. "I implemented the first x/y spatial layout for a mobile app. Utilizing the x/y screen layout, the user can swipe up, down, left and right from the main landing screen. The screen layout is similar to a plus sign. No hidden menu`s or unnecessary swipes. An intuitive design for an intuitive currency." They were able to iterate quickly due to Johnson`s strong mobile development background. Johnson is also the head of mobile development at Ripple Labs.The ZeroBlock team takes the Bitcoin mobile experience to the next level as they constantly iterate, keeping the app relevant and accurate. The company`s next goal is to add more charts, data analytics, and article feeds. And in the horizon, they hope to build a tablet version for their most dedicated Bitcoiner fans. ZeroBlock continues to strive to be the only app Bitcoin users need to keep up with the Bitcoin markets.To learn more about ZeroBlock, please visit: Download ZeroBlock on iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zeroblock/id643184018?mt=8Download ZeroBlock on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phlint.android.zeroblock&hl=enVisit http://www.zeroblock.com/ for more information.Contact Info Name: Dan Held, Co-Founder, ZeroBlock
