CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- The company responsible for a chemical spill that contaminated water in West Virginia will bring in sturdier containment structures after incurring safety violations at a second chemical storage facility.Inspectors ordered Freedom Industries to move all its chemicals to a second facility in Nitro after Thursday's spill in Charleston, which contaminated the drinking water for 300,000 people. But this week, they found five safety violations at the second spot. A report said that like the Charleston facility, the Nitro site's last-resort containment wall had holes in it.To comply with a state order, Freedom will store the Nitro facility's chemicals in double-walled tanks. Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Tom Aluise expects all material to be transferred by Jan. 23. The Nitro facility isn't on a riverbank. The Charleston one is.
