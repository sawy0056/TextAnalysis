HONG KONG, CHINA--(Marketwired - Apr 22, 2014) - Artesyn Embedded Technologies, formerly Emerson Network Power's Embedded Computing & Power business, announced the first Titanium efficiency bulk front-end power supply in its standard product range: the DS3000TE-3.This new 3000 W power supply uses proprietary Artesyn power switching technology and high density component packaging techniques to provide servers, networking, telecom and other redundant power applications with the highest efficiency solution. The DS3000TE-3 fully uses the current capacity of 208 to 264 V AC distribution lines, allowing systems to draw the maximum amount of power at the least amount of losses. It has been certified by 80 PLUS® to greater than 96 percent efficiency at 50 percent load, defined as Titanium efficiency. A Platinum efficiency version, the DS3000PE-3, is also available in Artesyn's DS3000 series to provide customers with an alternative option for more cost-sensitive systems, while still offering a high power density of 24 W/in3.Artesyn DS3000 series power supplies generate a main payload output of 12 V DC for feeding downstream dc-dc converters in systems using distributed power architectures, together with a 12 V DC standby output rated at 4.5 A for power management circuitry. The main DC output of the DS3000 series can deliver up to 250 A, and stays within regulation down to zero load. Measuring just 4.15 x 2.78 x 11 inches (105.5 x 61.5 x 282.6mm), six units can fit in a standard 19 inch rack for a total of 16.2 kW. Active current sharing helps maximize cost-effectiveness by eliminating the need for additional components when paralleling multiple power supplies for very high current applications.Artesyn DS3000 series power supplies are fully digital and compatible with Artesyn's universal PMBus™ graphical user interface, allowing control via an integral I2C interface using the industry-standard PMBus communications protocol. Extensive performance monitoring facilities enable system integrators to implement sophisticated power management schemes -- in addition to input and output voltage and current, real and reactive input power and power supply temperature values can be retrieved via the I2C bus interface.Artesyn DS3000 series power supplies feature built-in ORing and inrush current is limited to 55 A. The power supplies are comprehensively protected against fault conditions, including undervoltage, overvoltage and overcurrent of the main and standby output, fan failure and overtemperature. The standby output auto-recovers from over-voltage and overcurrent conditions; the main output auto-recovers from minor short-duration current overloads, but will latch persistent overcurrent faults, as well as any overvoltage condition. In the event of a failure, the power supplies are quick and easy to exchange; a series of front panel LEDs highlight the faulty unit, while opposite-end ac input and dc output connectors and a single-lever tray lock mechanism facilitate removal and replacement.Artesyn DS3000 series power supplies have an ambient operating temperature range of 10 to 40 degrees Celsius and incorporate low-noise fan cooling; forward and reverse airflow versions are available to suit different rack cooling schemes. The power supplies meet the rigorous FCC Part 15 Subpart B conducted emission standard and comply with the EN 61000-4-11 standard for EMC immunity. They also carry a wide set of safety approvals, including UL/cUL/EN 60950, CE Mark and China CQC.Designed specifically for long term reliability in high availability applications, Artesyn's DS3000 series power supplies have a calculated operating life of five years and mean time between failure (MTBF) of 400,000 hours (calculated in accordance with Bellcore SR-332), running at full load and 25 degrees Celsius ambient. The power supplies are backed by a comprehensive two-year warranty.A high resolution photo of the DS3000 series is available.The 80 PLUS verification and testing report is available.Company Logo http://release.media-outreach.com/i/Download/1489
