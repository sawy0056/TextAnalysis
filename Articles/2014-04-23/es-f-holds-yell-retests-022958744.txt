There will be plenty of earnings released during the balance of this week – and the powers that be will lean on the outcome of the data going into next week as the S&P approaches the all-time highs.Posted yesterday: Therefore, I am going to keep it short – sideways consolidation was the flavor. On the bright side, the bulls keep some pressure on the bears, but the next set of stops rest above the Yell, 1866.25, and the bulls have been knocking on the door trying to see what is above there. So far, no one is willing to extend – lead the charge to convert that level to support.Chicagostock (09:06) yesterday’s upper vol window was 1865, we closed above that into end of day giving the spill leading into today, if we move +10 off that level gives way into 1875, for now today’s upper vol window first level of resistance, hold above to establish bull bias for today can become a trap.Today started with 164k ESM traded on Globex, trading range was 1867.00 – 1860.75.

Either way, the risk-on crowd previously and wisely locked in some profits as the high-flying biotechs and the high-beta Nasdaq stocks took a brief swan dive – only to see the profits reallocated to other sectors in the stock market. That rotation is actually healthy – whether we see the uptick in volume or not. However, at the end of the day, the S&P is still within that all too familiar range of 1840 to 1880 – aside from the brief rally to the all-time high of 1892 leading up to and immediately following the last employment release on April 4.Sam_Easley (11:28) this is a gigantic spot (1878) for the pit es. the previous times we got here they puked it only to have the 3rd time make new highs. they will remember it.PivotBoss Midday Updatehttp://bit.ly/1gPpwhm Updated ADR http://bit.ly/1nF042HKathy lunch update http://structuraltrading.adobeconnect.com/p85jh5hyu07/The MrTopStep imbalance Meter, MiM, showed a small sell imbalance of $120M before flipping to $380M to the buy side going into the cash close.
