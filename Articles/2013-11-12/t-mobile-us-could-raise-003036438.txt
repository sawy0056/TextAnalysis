Other shareholders own roughly 190 million shares.Many U.S. mobile operators have been looking to increase their spectrum holdings to boost their network capacity to support customers who are using more and more bandwidth-hungry data services.T-Mobile has to push hard to regain ground after losing subscribers for four years. It started to turn the corner with subscriber growth in the second quarter but it needs more spectrum to keep competing well with much bigger rivals Sprint, AT&T Inc and Verizon Wireless.The company's shares fell almost 3 percent in after-the-bell trade to $26.25 after closing down 2.5 percent in the regular New York Stock Exchange session.T-Mobile said that Morgan Stanley, Goldman, Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are the joint book-running managers for the offering.(Reporting by Sinead Carew; Editing by Leslie Adler)
