The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee has already told banks to strengthen their defences.The London event will be co-ordinated by the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority and follows a similar exercise two years ago.London is not alone in testing its preparation. New York staged "Quantum Dawn 2" a few months ago to simulate how firms would cope with a cyber attack in markets.(Reporting by Matt Scuffham and Steve Slater; Editing by David Holmes)
