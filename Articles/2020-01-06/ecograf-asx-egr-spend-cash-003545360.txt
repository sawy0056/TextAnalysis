For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed. But while the successes are well known, investors should not ignore the very many unprofitable companies that simply burn through all their cash and collapse.Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether EcoGraf (ASX:EGR) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. View our latest analysis for EcoGraf How Long Is EcoGraf's Cash Runway?You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. In June 2019, EcoGraf had AU$1.5m in cash, and was debt-free. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through AU$3.6m. That means it had a cash runway of around 5 months as of June 2019. That's a very short cash runway which indicates an imminent need to douse the cash burn or find more funding. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.ASX:EGR Historical Debt, January 5th 2020MoreHow Is EcoGraf's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?Because EcoGraf isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. As it happens, the company's cash burn reduced by 3.7% over the last year, which suggests that management may be mindful of the risks of their depleting cash reserves. EcoGraf makes us a little nervous due to its lack of substantial operating revenue. We prefer most of the stocks on this list of stocks that analysts expect to grow.How Easily Can EcoGraf Raise Cash?Even though it has reduced its cash burn recently, shareholders should still consider how easy it would be for EcoGraf to raise more cash in the future. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.Since it has a market capitalisation of AU$24m, EcoGraf's AU$3.6m in cash burn equates to about 15% of its market value. Given that situation, it's fair to say the company wouldn't have much trouble raising more cash for growth, but shareholders would be somewhat diluted.So, Should We Worry About EcoGraf's Cash Burn?On this analysis of EcoGraf's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its cash runway has us a bit worried. Considering all the measures mentioned in this report, we reckon that its cash burn is fairly risky, and if we held shares we'd be watching like a hawk for any deterioration. While it's important to consider hard data like the metrics discussed above, many investors would also be interested to note that EcoGraf insiders have been trading shares in the company.
