You can see in the image below that the average P/E (7.0) for companies in the real estate industry is lower than Colour Life Services Group's P/E.SEHK:1778 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 5th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Colour Life Services Group shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Most would be impressed by Colour Life Services Group earnings growth of 12% in the last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 28% per year over the last five years. This could arguably justify a relatively high P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does Colour Life Services Group's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Colour Life Services Group has net debt worth 23% of its market capitalization. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Verdict On Colour Life Services Group's P/E RatioColour Life Services Group trades on a P/E ratio of 9.6, which is below the HK market average of 10.7. The EPS growth last year was strong, and debt levels are quite reasonable. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified. Given analysts are expecting further growth, one might have expected a higher P/E ratio. That may be worth further research.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
