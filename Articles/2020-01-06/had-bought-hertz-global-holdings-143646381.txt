(NYSE:HTZ) share price up 26% in a single quarter. But spare a thought for the long term holders, who have held the stock as it bled value over the last five years. Indeed, the share price is down a whopping 95% in that time. It's true that the recent bounce could signal the company is turning over a new leaf, but we are not so sure. The real question is whether the business can leave its past behind and improve itself over the years ahead.While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness. View our latest analysis for Hertz Global Holdings Given that Hertz Global Holdings didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.Over half a decade Hertz Global Holdings reduced its trailing twelve month revenue by 1.4% for each year. While far from catastrophic that is not good. The share price fall of 46% (per year, over five years) is a stern reminder that money-losing companies are expected to grow revenue. It takes a certain kind of mental fortitude (or recklessness) to buy shares in a company that loses money and doesn't grow revenue. Fear of becoming a 'bagholder' may be keeping people away from this stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:HTZ Income Statement, January 5th 2020MoreYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?Investors should note that there's a difference between Hertz Global Holdings's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. We note that Hertz Global Holdings's TSR, at -87% is higher than its share price return of -95%. When you consider it hasn't been paying a dividend, this data suggests shareholders have benefitted from a spin-off, or had the opportunity to acquire attractively priced shares in a discounted capital raising.A Different PerspectiveHertz Global Holdings provided a TSR of 24% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. But at least that's still a gain! Over five years the TSR has been a reduction of 33% per year, over five years. It could well be that the business is stabilizing. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can
