That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does China Mengniu Dairy Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. As you can see below, China Mengniu Dairy has a higher P/E than the average company (15.9) in the food industry.SEHK:2319 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 5th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that China Mengniu Dairy shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification.

I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.It's nice to see that China Mengniu Dairy grew EPS by a stonking 43% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 12%. I'd therefore be a little surprised if its P/E ratio was not relatively high.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).How Does China Mengniu Dairy's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Since China Mengniu Dairy holds net cash of CN¥3.3b, it can spend on growth, justifying a higher P/E ratio than otherwise.The Bottom Line On China Mengniu Dairy's P/E RatioChina Mengniu Dairy's P/E is 31.3 which is above average (10.7) in its market.
