This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. See our latest analysis for Claranova How Does Pierre Cesarini's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?At the time of writing, our data says that Claranova SE has a market cap of €315m, and reported total annual CEO compensation of €2.7m for the year to June 2019. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the salary is lower, valued at €277k. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. When we examined a selection of companies with market caps ranging from €179m to €716m, we found the median CEO total compensation was €396k.It would therefore appear that Claranova SE pays Pierre Cesarini more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into the underlying business performance.You can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at Claranova, below.ENXTPA:CLA CEO Compensation, January 5th 2020MoreIs Claranova SE Growing?Claranova SE has increased its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 15% a year, over the last three years (using a line of best fit).
