But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the Eezy Oyj (HEL:EEZY) share price is 76% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 13% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Note that businesses generally develop over the long term, so the returns over the last year might not reflect a long term trend. See our latest analysis for Eezy Oyj Given that Eezy Oyj only made minimal earnings in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue to gauge its business development. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.Over the last twelve months, Eezy Oyj's revenue grew by 57%. That's well above most other pre-profit companies. The solid 76% share price gain goes down pretty well, but it's not necessarily as good as you might expect given the top notch revenue growth. If that's the case, now might be the time to take a close look at Eezy Oyj. Since we evolved from monkeys, we think in linear terms by nature.

So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Eezy Oyj, it has a TSR of 88% for the last year.
