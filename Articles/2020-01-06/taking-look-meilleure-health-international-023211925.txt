With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Meilleure Health International Industry Group Limited (HKG:2327).Over the last twelve months Meilleure Health International Industry Group has recorded a ROE of 6.8%. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each HK$1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made HK$0.07 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Meilleure Health International Industry Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Meilleure Health International Industry Group:6.8% = HK$82m ÷ HK$1.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does ROE Signify?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Meilleure Health International Industry Group Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Meilleure Health International Industry Group has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Trade Distributors industry (6.8%).SEHK:2327 Past Revenue and Net Income, January 5th 2020MoreThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. ROE tells us about the quality of the business, but it does not give us much of an idea if the share price is cheap. If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Meilleure Health International Industry Group's Debt And Its 6.8% ROEMeilleure Health International Industry Group has a debt to equity ratio of 0.31, which is far from excessive. Although the ROE isn't overly impressive, the debt load is modest, suggesting the business has potential. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company's ability to take advantage of future opportunities.Story continuesBut It's Just One MetricReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.
