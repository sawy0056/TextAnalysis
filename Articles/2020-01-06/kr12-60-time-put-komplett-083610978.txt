As a small cap stock, hardly covered by any analysts, there is generally more of an opportunity for mispricing as there is less activity to push the stock closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity here to buy? Let’s examine Komplett Bank’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Komplett Bank What's the opportunity in Komplett Bank?Great news for investors – Komplett Bank is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is NOK23.85, but it is currently trading at kr12.60 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that Komplett Bank’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of Komplett Bank look like?OB:KOMP Past and Future Earnings, January 5th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
