It connects to a Thunderbolt 3-equipped computer and offers the power and space needed by today's most popular double-wide full-length/full-height AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards. The Node Titan lets video pros, gamers and VR headset owners immerse themselves in stunningly realistic FPS gaming; perform rapid video renders and enjoy buttery smooth playback; easily work with VR, AR, and animation apps; and utilize a VR headset – all without frustration or compromise.(PRNewsfoto/OWC)MoreOffers Notebooks A Heavyweight Graphics PunchFor users who have dreamed of a portable editing system, welcome to a new workflow reality. The Node Titan turns internally limited graphics editing notebook computers like the MacBook Pro into a powerful NLE (Non-Linear Editing) machine. No more system performance slowing to a crawl with even basic effects. Pros can now knock out effects-laden timelines and high-quality exports in dramatic fashion with an immediate time-saving ROI. By adding a second Node Titan, performance-hungry users can tap into the processing power of multiple eGPUs for exponential gains in timeline performance and accelerated renders/exports.Explore A Different RealityWithout an eGPU like the Node Titan, exploring new dimensions with an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive VR headset on a standard notebook is pure fantasy. To start seeing what you've been missing, just plug a VR headset directly into the Node Titan's DisplayPort. You can even connect a second or third external display for extra workspace and productivity.Accelerates Both Pro Apps and GamesTruly a mobile work and entertainment game-changer, Node Titan accelerates 3D graphics-based pro apps, games and VR. In macOS 10.14 and later, turn on "Prefer external GPU" and on Windows 10, adjust display graphics settings in your app/game to "High performance" to experience vastly improved lighting, richly detailed textures and breathtaking visual effects.Easily Handles Power-Hungry CardsFor graphics cards (sold separately) that require more than the x16 PCIe slot industry standard 75W output, no problem. The Node Titan features a class-leading 650W power supply that can handle power-hungry cards like the Radeon RX Vega 64. Speaking of handling, thanks to Node Titan's spacious design, even double-wide full-length/full-height cards are compatible.HighlightsLightning-fast graphics: Thunderbolt 3 port for up to 40Gb/s speed NLE ready: turns notebooks into mobile video editing systems Immediate ROI: vastly reduced edit and render times Satisfies power-hungry cards: 650W power supply Play or work while charging: up to 85W for notebook charging Spacious design: enables use of large double-width graphics cards On-the-go graphics: retractable carrying handle for easy transport 3D realism: enables effective use of VR headsets Plug and Play: includes Thunderbolt 3 cable for immediate use Toolless access: thumb screws for easy card installationAnd unlike other eGPUs that come as a bundled solution and cannot be upgraded in the future, Node Titan gives users the power of choice in deciding which graphics card to install for their present needs. If those needs change in the future, simply swap cards to keep graphics performance on the cutting edge.Story continuesPricing & AvailabilityThe Akitio Node Titan is expected to be available in Q1 of 2020 through MacSales.com.About OWCOther World Computing (OWC), founded in 1988, is dedicated to helping Mac and PC enthusiasts do more and reach higher.
