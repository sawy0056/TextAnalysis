Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Barrett Business Services! NasdaqGS:BBSI Historical Dividend Yield, January 5th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 15% of Barrett Business Services's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. Given the low payout ratio, it is hard to envision the dividend coming under threat, barring a catastrophe.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Barrett Business Services's cash payout ratio last year was 11%. Cash flows are typically lumpy, but this looks like an appropriately conservative payout. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Barrett Business Services's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Barrett Business Services's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Barrett Business Services's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.32 in 2010, compared to US$1.20 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 14% per year over this time.With rapid dividend growth and no notable cuts to the dividend over a lengthy period of time, we think this company has a lot going for it.Dividend Growth PotentialWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Barrett Business Services has grown its earnings per share at 27% per annum over the past five years. The company is only paying out a fraction of its earnings as dividends, and in the past been able to use the retained earnings to grow its profits rapidly - an ideal combination.Story continuesConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Barrett Business Services's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we like that the company's dividend payments appear well covered, although the retained capital also needs to be effectively reinvested.
