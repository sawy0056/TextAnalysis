But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Eastern (NASDAQ:EML), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. View our latest analysis for Eastern Eastern's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Eastern has managed to grow EPS by 23% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note Eastern's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 3.4% to US$240m. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

That makes it extra important to check on its balance sheet strength.Are Eastern Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Like the kids in the streets standing up for their beliefs, insider share purchases give me reason to believe in a brighter future. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.We note that Eastern insiders spent US$192k on stock, over the last year; in contrast, we didn't see any selling. That puts the company in a nice light, as it makes me think its leaders are feeling confident. We also note that it was the President, August Vlak, who made the biggest single acquisition, paying US$140k for shares at about US$24.50 each.Does Eastern Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Eastern has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Not only is that growth rate rather juicy, but the insider buying makes my mouth water. So on this analysis I believe Eastern is probably worth spending some time on. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Eastern by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.The good news is that Eastern is not the only growth stock with insider buying.
