Bulgaria hopes to be able to make shipments to Serbia by May and build the whole section by year-end.While Russia and Ukraine at the end of last year signed a five-year agreement on gas transit to Europe, volumes are set to fall from 65 bcm in 2020 to 40 bcm annually from 2021 to 2024.Relations between the one-time allies have deteriorated since Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014 and pro-Kremlin separatists seized a swath of eastern Ukraine.Ukraine halted its own direct imports of Russian gas in November 2015.(Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; editing by Jason Neely)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextOil’s Worst Week Since 2014 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloomberg33 Turkish soldiers killed in Syria's IdlibAFPOPEC Chief Says Group Is Making Renewed Push for Oil DealBloombergWhy Russia Is Completely Ignoring This New German-Made SubmarineThe National InterestUS envoy says Russia faceoff shows Turkey its true allyAFPRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
