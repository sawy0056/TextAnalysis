As a small cap stock, which tends to lack high analyst coverage, there is generally more of an opportunity for mispricing as there is less activity to push the stock closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity here to buy? Let’s take a look at Mycronic’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Mycronic What's the opportunity in Mycronic?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my relative valuation model. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 22.02x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 24.22x, which means if you buy Mycronic today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that Mycronic should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Mycronic’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Mycronic?OM:MYCR Past and Future Earnings, January 5th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Mycronic, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -5.0%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? MYCR seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on MYCR, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MYCR for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on MYCR should the price fluctuate below its true value.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
