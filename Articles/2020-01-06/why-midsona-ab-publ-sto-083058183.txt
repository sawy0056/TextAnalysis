In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Midsona:0.052 = kr181m ÷ (kr4.2b - kr716m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Midsona has an ROCE of 5.2%.

What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Midsona.How Midsona's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCECurrent liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Midsona has total liabilities of kr716m and total assets of kr4.2b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 17% of its total assets. It is good to see a restrained amount of current liabilities, as this limits the effect on ROCE.What We Can Learn From Midsona's ROCEStory continuesIf Midsona continues to earn an uninspiring ROCE, there may be better places to invest.
