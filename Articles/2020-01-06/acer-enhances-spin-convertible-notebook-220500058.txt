Professionals and students will appreciate a flexible design that allows them to effortlessly sketch, take notes, create content and give presentations throughout their day, all with one easy twist.Acer Incorporated Logo (PRNewsfoto/Acer Incorporated)MoreThe new Acer Spin models both feature an included fast-charging Acer Active Stylus that employs Wacom AES technology, reliable and speedy Wi-Fi 6 and a full range of ports, including USB Type C with support for Thunderbolt™ 3. The hinge features a design that elevates the keyboard in laptop mode, allowing for a comfortable typing experience."The new Acer Spin 5 and Spin 3 are excellent choices for anyone looking for a single system that can handle work, school, entertainment and their hobbies," said James Lin, General Manager, Notebooks, IT Products Business, Acer Inc. "The combination of thinner and lighter form factors and thin-bezel touch displays make the new Spin 5 and Spin 3 convertibles the ideal choices for anyone who wants to get a lot done in a variety of modes."Slimmer Aluminum Designs for Flexible All-Day UseThe new Spin 5 and Spin 3 feature slimmer designs that make their convertible form factors more enjoyable to use with four usage modes: tablet, notebook, display or tent. Durable 360-degree hinges allow for smooth transitions between modes, so professionals and students can effortlessly change tasks. An optional backlit keyboard extends productivity to low-light environments.Measuring only 0.59 inches (14.9 mm) thin, the Spin 5 (SP513-54N) features an eye-catching 13.5-inch 2K touch display surrounded by slim bezels that are only 7.78 mm narrow, giving it an 80% screen-to-body ratio. The display's 3:2 aspect ratio adds 18% more vertical space compared to an equally wide 16:9 display, so users scroll less when viewing websites, documents, and spreadsheets. Plus, the Spin 5's magnesium aluminum chassis and palm rest make it durable and lightweight — only 2.65 lbs (1.2 kg). The Spin 5 also comes with an integrated fingerprint reader for fast and more secure logins via Windows Hello. Offering a large 14-inch Full HD display, the new Spin 3 (SP314-54N) has a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio and thin 7.82 mm bezels that provide a 78% screen-to-body ratio. The large widescreen touch display gives ample room for working on multiple projects, comparing documents and enjoying vibrant video. Weighing 3.31 pounds (1.5 kg) and measuring 0.67 inches (16.9 mm) thin, the sleek and stylish aluminum chassis fits comfortably into a brief case or book bag.Quick-Charging Dockable Acer Active Stylus with Long Battery Life Both the Spin 5 and Spin 3 come standard with a fast-charging Acer Active Stylus using Wacom AES (active electrostatic) technology which replicates actual ink and paper with 4,096 pressure levels, so writing, drawing and all pen interactions are precise and realistic. The Spin 5 supports an optional Acer Active Stylus with Wacom AES 2.0 technology for an even smoother and more accurate writing experience.The stylus' length resembles that of an actual pen (4.93 inches, 12.53 cm) and has a textured feel, making it comfortable to hold. When not in use, the stylus can be kept in a convenient storage dock, where it's kept safe and quick-charged. It can be used for 90 minutes of active writing after just a 15-second charge.Story continuesAll-Day Performance and Connectivity and EntertainmentPowered by up to 10th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 processors, the Acer Spin 5 and Spin 3 deliver responsive performance and powerful Intel® Iris® Plus integrated graphics[3] for entertainment, video editing and casual game play.
