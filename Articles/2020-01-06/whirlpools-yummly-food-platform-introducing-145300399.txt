Users can multitask with confidence as the Smart Thermometer tracks internal temperature while cooking raw, dense meats, like poultry or roasts, and alerts them once their meal is cooked just right."The value of this smart thermometer is that you can stick it in a raw chicken, forget about it, and have confidence that you'll be enjoying a delicious meal that's cooked at the ideal temperature," said Joel Gamoran, Yummly Pro featured chef and content collaborator. "You don't need to be a chef to multitask in the kitchen — the Yummly Smart Thermometer watches and adjusts your cooking so you can manage other dishes and activities."Additional connected features will be available in late 2020, making the Yummly Smart Thermometer our first wireless smart thermometer to communicate with connected Whirlpool ovens. This smart capability means the oven will know what step users are on in the recipe, and will automatically adjust the temperature up, down, to roast, to broil — whatever is needed to achieve the best results.Yummly makes it easier than ever for people to dive into home cooking with this new smart meat thermometer, personalized recipe discovery, hands-on cooking lessons with Yummly Pro and a seamless connection to select Whirlpool smart ovens.Personalization: Yummly maintains a massive library of more than 2 million recipes to provide users with customized recommendations that fit their lifestyle, taste preferences and dietary needs.

Using Yummly Pro, the integration of select recipes with Whirlpool connected ovens, and the Yummly Smart Thermometer to guide their cooking, foodies and families learn from the best, one recipe at a time, with temperature precision at every step. Control your oven from anywhere, anytime: With Whirlpool's connected appliances, users can start cooking before they even walk into the kitchen. Get a head start by selecting "start cooking" within connected Yummly recipes, including select Yummly Pro recipes, to send a command to a connected oven to begin preheating at the precise temperature needed. "Not everyone has the time and patience to cook. Between after-school and after-work activities, errands and homework, the last thing people want to do when they get home from a long day is spend time constantly checking if their dinner is ready," said Andrew Grose, Head of Business Development & Operations, Yummly. "We understand the precision that goes into cooking the perfect roasted chicken, so it was important to us in developing the Yummly Smart Thermometer to focus first on monitoring and alerting, and second on wireless communication to auto-adjust oven cooking methods and temperatures at the perfect time."From personalized recipe recommendations and weekly meal planning, to handy chef tricks of the trade and guided videos, Yummly has everything needed to improve life in the kitchen every step of the way.
