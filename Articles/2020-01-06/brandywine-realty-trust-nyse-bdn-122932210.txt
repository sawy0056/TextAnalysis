But not every stock you buy will perform as well as the overall market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) share price is up 20% in the last year, that falls short of the market return.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Brandywine Realty Trust the TSR over the last year was 26%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveBrandywine Realty Trust shareholders are up 26% for the year (even including dividends) . Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 4.0% per year over five year.
