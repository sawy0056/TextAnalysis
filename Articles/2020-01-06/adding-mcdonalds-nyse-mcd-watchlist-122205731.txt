But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath.View our latest analysis for McDonald'sHow Fast Is McDonald's Growing?As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. McDonald's managed to grow EPS by 13% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. It seems McDonald's is pretty stable, since revenue and EBIT margins are pretty flat year on year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a small fortune of shares, currently valued at US$71m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to make me think that management will be very focussed on long term growth.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but I find myself wondering if remuneration policies are shareholder friendly. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like McDonald's, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$11m.Story continuesThe CEO of McDonald's only received US$4.7m in total compensation for the year ending December 2018. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance, that arrangement seems generous to shareholders, and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is McDonald's Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of McDonald's is that it is growing profits. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for McDonald's, but the pretty picture gets better than that. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusive discounted cashflow valuation of McDonald's.
