And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) share price is up 86% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 53% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 50% in the last year. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, United Rentals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 11.38.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:URI Past and Future Earnings, January 5th 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
