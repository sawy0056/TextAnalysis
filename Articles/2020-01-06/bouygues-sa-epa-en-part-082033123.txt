Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Bouygues. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ENXTPA:EN Historical Dividend Yield, January 5th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Bouygues paid out 45% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. With a cash payout ratio of 249%, Bouygues's dividend payments are poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. While Bouygues's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, free cash flow is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Bouygues to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Bouygues's latest financial position,

For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Bouygues's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €1.60 in 2010, compared to €1.70 last year. Dividend payments have grown at less than 1% a year over this period.Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think is seriously impressive.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Bouygues has grown its earnings per share at 30% per annum over the past five years. With high earnings per share growth in recent times and a modest payout ratio, we think this is an attractive combination if earnings can be reinvested to generate further growth.Story continuesConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Bouygues has a low payout ratio, which we like, although it paid out virtually all of its generated cash. We like that it has been delivering solid improvement in its earnings per share, and relatively consistent dividend payments. Overall we think Bouygues is an interesting dividend stock, although it could be better.Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
