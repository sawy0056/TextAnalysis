View our latest analysis for Cigna How Does David Cordani's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, Cigna Corporation has a market capitalization of US$76b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$19m over the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$1.5m. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We took a group of companies with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, and calculated the median CEO total compensation to be US$11m. (We took a wide range because the CEOs of massive companies tend to be paid similar amounts - even though some are quite a bit bigger than others).It would therefore appear that Cigna Corporation pays David Cordani more than the median CEO remuneration at large companies, in the same market.
