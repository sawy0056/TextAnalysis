But that doesn't mean long term investors can avoid big losses. Zooming in on an example, the First Pacific Company Limited (HKG:142) share price dropped 67% in the last half decade. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. Check out our latest analysis for First Pacific To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).In the last half decade First Pacific saw its share price fall as its EPS declined below zero. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. But we would generally expect a lower price, given the situation.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:142 Past and Future Earnings, January 5th 2020MoreDive deeper into First Pacific's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of First Pacific's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of First Pacific, it has a TSR of -61% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveFirst Pacific shareholders are down 13% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 14%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 17% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We would want clear information suggesting the company will grow, before taking the view that the share price will stabilize. Importantly, we haven't analysed First Pacific's dividend history.
