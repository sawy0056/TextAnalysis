Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Chevron. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 1.2% of market capitalisation this year. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Chevron for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Chevron! NYSE:CVX Historical Dividend Yield, January 5th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 67% of Chevron's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Chevron paid out 52% of its free cash flow last year, which is acceptable, but is starting to limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested into the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Chevron's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Chevron's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$2.60 in 2010, compared to US$4.76 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.2% a year over that time.Businesses that can grow their dividends at a decent rate and maintain a stable payout can generate substantial wealth for shareholders over the long term.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. In the last five years, Chevron's earnings per share have shrunk at approximately 8.9% per annum. A modest decline in earnings per share is not great to see, but it doesn't automatically make a dividend unsustainable. Still, we'd vastly prefer to see EPS growth when researching dividend stocks.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. First, we think Chevron is paying out an acceptable percentage of its cashflow and profit. Second, earnings per share have actually shrunk, but at least the dividends have been relatively stable. While we're not hugely bearish on it, overall we think there are potentially better dividend stocks than Chevron out there.Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company.If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of dividend stocks yielding above 3%.If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
