CBP officials contacted at the Blaine Port of Entry provided no comment or reasons for the detentions.[NOTE: CAIR published "Know Your Rights" materials online in English, Arabic, Somali, Urdu, Farsi, Bengali, and Bosnian.

"The vast majority of people being held last night were American citizens," said Crystal. "We kept asking why we were being detained and asked questions that had nothing to do with our reason for traveling and was told 'I'm sorry this is just the wrong time for you guys.'"A source at CBP reported that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued a national order to CBP to "report" and detain anyone with Iranian heritage entering the country who is deemed potentially suspicious or "adversarial," regardless of citizenship status. CBP at the Peace Arch Border Crossing did not confirm or deny this report. "These reports are extremely troubling and potentially constitute illegal detentions of United States citizens," said
Masih Fouladi, executive director of CAIR-WA. "We are working to verify reports of a broad nationwide directive to detain Iranian-Americans at ports of entry so that we can provide community members with accurate travel guidance. We will continue to update the community and other civil rights organizations as we obtain more information." CAIR is America's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization.
