The 10 stocks in the benchmark are equally weighted to the tune of 10% apiece.For tactical traders looking beyond the Iranian controversy, NRGU could have some utility this year because many analysts view the energy sector as attractively valued and primed to outperform after ranking as the worst-performing S&P 500 group last year.What's NextAs is always the case with geared instruments, it's good to have choices and for trader to prepare for the fact that their initial thesis could be wrong.MicroSectors has that based covered as it pertains to NRGU in the form of the MicroSectors U.S. Big Oil Index -3X Leveraged ETN (NYSE: NRGD), the triple-leveraged inverse equivalent of NRGU.Should oil rise without names like Exxon and Chevron following suit, NRGD could be the biggest beneficiary of the current calamity with Iran.Photo credit: Adam Jones, Flickr0See more from BenzingaAn ETF For A Sector Analysts Are Bullish On Heading Into 2020© 2020 Benzinga.com.
