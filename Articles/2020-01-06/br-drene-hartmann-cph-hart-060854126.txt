For example, long term Brødrene Hartmann A/S (CPH:HART) shareholders have enjoyed a 73% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 55% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 25% , including dividends . See our latest analysis for Brødrene Hartmann There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Brødrene Hartmann achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.3% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).CPSE:HART Past and Future Earnings, January 5th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Brødrene Hartmann's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Brødrene Hartmann's TSR for the last 5 years was 103%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveBrødrene Hartmann's TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 25%. Most would be happy with a gain, and it helps that the year's return is actually better than the average return over five years, which was 15%. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at Brødrene Hartmann's dividend track record.
