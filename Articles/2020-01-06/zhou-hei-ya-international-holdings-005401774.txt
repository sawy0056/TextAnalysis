But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Zhou Hei Ya International Holdings Company Limited (HKG:1458) share price is up 64% in the last year, clearly besting the market return of around 9.7% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! In contrast, the longer term returns are negative, since the share price is 16% lower than it was three years ago. Check out our latest analysis for Zhou Hei Ya International Holdings While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over the last twelve months, Zhou Hei Ya International Holdings actually shrank its EPS by 36%.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, it seems likely that investors are putting more weight on metrics other than EPS, at the moment.Revenue was pretty flat year on year, but maybe a closer look at the data can explain the market optimism.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).SEHK:1458 Income Statement, January 5th 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Zhou Hei Ya International Holdings will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Zhou Hei Ya International Holdings's TSR for the last year was 71%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Zhou Hei Ya International Holdings rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 71% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 3.5% per year over three years. The optimist would say this is evidence that the stock has bottomed, and better days lie ahead.
