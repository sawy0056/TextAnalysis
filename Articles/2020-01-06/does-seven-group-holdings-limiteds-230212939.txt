This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. Check out our latest analysis for Seven Group Holdings How Does Ryan Stokes's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, Seven Group Holdings Limited has a market capitalization of AU$6.7b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth AU$4.8m over the year to June 2019. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the salary is lower, valued at AU$1.6m. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We examined companies with market caps from AU$2.9b to AU$9.2b, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was AU$3.3m.It would therefore appear that Seven Group Holdings Limited pays Ryan Stokes more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market.
