The jumbo mortgage estimates for San Francisco and San Jose don’t include mortgage insurance, but do include a rate premium. Jumbo mortgage structures vary by lender, but figures shown will end up similar for most jumbo borrower profiles. – Economists & Real Estate Experts Give Zillow 2020 Expectations Of 25 U.S. Markets– Read more stories on Homes and MoneyDO YOU LIKE MONEY?
