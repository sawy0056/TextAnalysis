A special license would be required to sell software outside the U.S. that can automatically scan aerial images to identify objects of interest, such as vehicles or houses.The rules could affect a growing sector of the tech industry using algorithms to analyze satellite images of crops, trade patterns and other changes affecting the economy or
environment. The new export rules are the result of Congress passing a law in 2018 that updated national security-related export controls to protect “emerging and foundational” technology that could end up in the hands of foreign governments.It's an interim rule until the public has a chance to weigh in before March, but the Commerce Department says it is in the national security interests of the U.S. to immediately implement the controls Monday.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextUS economy grew 2.3% in 2019, durable goods solid in JanuaryAFPU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersEUR/USD Mid-Session Technical Analysis for February 27, 2020FX EmpireU.S. Quarterly GDP Revisions Show Weaker Underlying DemandBloombergU.S. economy grows steadily in fourth-quarter, but coronavirus looms largeReutersRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
