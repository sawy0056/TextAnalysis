The number of retirees collecting Social Security checks outside of the U.S. surpassed 400,000 in 2017, according to recent government data. Those looking to spend their golden years overseas will enjoy the country’s mediterranean climate, sandy beaches, and seafood cuisine, the magazine points out.“The quality of life in Portugal is really extraordinary today. I think people have this perception that it costs a lot to live in Europe because maybe they go on vacation there and they think that it's going to be really expensive to live there,” Jennifer Stevens, International Living’s executive editor, told YFi PM.“But it's surprisingly affordable when you live like a local,” she added.View photosInternational Living ranks the best places to retire abroad in 2020.MoreCompared to life in the United States, International Living’s Portugal correspondent Tricia Pimental spends roughly one-third less on expenses in Portugal.
