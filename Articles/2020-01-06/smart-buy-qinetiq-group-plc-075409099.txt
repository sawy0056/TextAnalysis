Historical Dividend Yield, January 5th 2020MoreHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving.

QinetiQ Group has delivered an average of 3.3% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past ten years of dividend payments.
