But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (NASDAQ:CMTL) share price has soared 198% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 14% over the last quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 10% in the last three months. See our latest analysis for Comtech Telecommunications To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Comtech Telecommunications became profitable within the last three years. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).NasdaqGS:CMTL Past and Future Earnings, January 5th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how Comtech Telecommunications has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Comtech Telecommunications the TSR over the last 3 years was 215%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Comtech Telecommunications has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 48% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 6.0% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
