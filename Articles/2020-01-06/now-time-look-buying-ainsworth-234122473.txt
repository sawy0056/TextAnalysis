Let’s examine Ainsworth Game Technology’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Ainsworth Game Technology What's the opportunity in Ainsworth Game Technology?According to my relative valuation model, the stock seems to be currently fairly priced. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Ainsworth Game Technology’s ratio of 23.22x is trading in-line with its industry peers’ ratio, which means if you buy Ainsworth Game Technology today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. In addition to this, it seems like Ainsworth Game Technology’s share price is quite stable, which could mean there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it’s fairly valued. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Ainsworth Game Technology generate?ASX:AGI Past and Future Earnings, January 5th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
