It's ideal for voluminous data roles including audio/video production and editing, photography, graphic design, database servers, financial applications, and more. Easy Setup automates disk configuration and makes setup recommendations. Users work worry-free with disks checked and verified before use plus early warnings prevent unexpected disk failure.Improving A Proven HistoryWhile becoming a leading developer of external drives over the past two decades, OWC began offering multi-drive units pre-configured with SoftRAID to offer customers enhanced data storage capabilities. Because SoftRAID proved to offer many of the same attributes our customers expect from our hardware, OWC acquired SoftRAID in 2014 so hardware and software teams could work together daily to create the easiest to use, most fully featured software RAID package available.The Security of Advanced Monitoring Getting work done fast while keeping your data safe is paramount. When it comes to protection, SoftRAID was designed to keep you working worry-free. SoftRAID checks and verifies new disks for errors before use, warns you when a disk is about to fail, and even keeps you working if you lose a drive. All these advanced monitoring tools work in the background to ensure you're constantly protected from a catastrophic, project-killing data loss.Unchain Hardware RAID LimitationsSoftRAID unshackles you from expensive hardware RAID technology that's not upgradeable or expandable. With SoftRAID, you can spread volumes over two or more drive enclosures for mind-boggling performance over a single hardware RAID device. Additionally, SoftRAID utilizes your computer's advanced processing power versus the slow processors found in most hardware RAID enclosures. The result is a fast and flexible RAID array that doesn't impact your computer system or applications.Perhaps the biggest advantage of SoftRAID over a hardware RAID is that you're not locked into specific hardware in order to access your data. With SoftRAID, you can replace a bad enclosure or upgrade, and the drives can be moved to that enclosure where you can access your data without skipping a beat. In contrast, if a hardware RAID system fails and it's out of production or supported anymore, all the data could be lost.HighlightsFlexible: create RAID 0, 1 volumes with SoftRAID Standard (Windows and Mac) Advanced: create RAID 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 6+, 1+0 (10) volumes and get email notifications for drive and RAID volume health with SoftRAID Pro (Mac only) Verified: volume validation ensures sectors can be read, parity is correct, and volume failure is minimized Certified: drives are checked before use to ensure they are safe for data storage Vigilant: early warning prediction helps protect against unexpected drive failure Cross-platform ready: Built-in MacDrive technology lets you exchange SoftRAID arrays between Windows and macOS computers Outperforms: up to 86% faster than AppleRAID Thorough: full TRIM support improves internal and external SSD performance in all RAID levels Risk-free: 30-day free trial of fully functional applicationSoftRAID Standard & SoftRAID ProWith SoftRAID Standard, Mac and PC users can create super-fast RAID 0 sets or ultra-secure RAID 1 sets, certify new disks before use, receive warnings when a disk is about to fail, and restore data quickly with fast rebuilding.SoftRAID Pro gives macOS users all the features found in SoftRAID Standard, plus five advanced RAID levels - RAID 4, 5, 6, 6+, 1+0 (10) - to offer even more protection and data security options.
