Mistry's family owns a sizable minority stake in Tata Sons, the group's parent entity.Mistry said his company, the diversified Shapoorji Pallonji group, would seek to appoint a member on the board of Tata Sons."I will however vigorously pursue all options to protect our rights as a minority shareholder, including that of resuming the 30-year history of a seat at the Board of Tata Sons," he said.The December order by National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) called the appointment of N Chandrasekaran, after Mistry's removal, illegal and also asked Ratan Tata not to interfere with matters of the company.Tata Sons appealed the NCLAT ruling in the Supreme Court this week. A handful of Tata group companies, including its crown jewel Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, have also appealed the decision."As an 18.37% shareholder, it is in our own interest to ensure the group's long-term success," Mistry said.Tata Trusts, a group of public charities, owns a controlling 66% stake in holding company Tata Sons, and is chaired by Ratan Tata.(Reporting by Promit Mukherjee; editing by David Evans)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSaks Parent to Go Private After Shareholders Accept New BidBloombergHudson’s Bay Co.
