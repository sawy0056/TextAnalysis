But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at Decisive Dividend Corporation (CVE:DE), which is up 16%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 4.6% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 4.8% , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for Decisive Dividend We don't think that Decisive Dividend's modest trailing twelve month profit has the market's full attention at the moment. We think revenue is probably a better guide. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. For shareholders to have confidence a company will grow profits significantly, it must grow revenue.In the last 3 years Decisive Dividend saw its revenue grow at 38% per year. That's much better than most loss-making companies. While the compound gain of 5.1% per year over three years is pretty good, you might argue it doesn't fully reflect the strong revenue growth. So now might be the perfect time to put Decisive Dividend on your radar.

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Decisive Dividend the TSR over the last 3 years was 51%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveOver the last year Decisive Dividend shareholders have received a TSR of 4.8%. While you don't go broke making a profit, this return was actually lower than the average market return of about 17%. But the (superior) three-year TSR of 15% per year is some consolation. We prefer focus on longer term returns, as they are usually a more meaningful indication of the underlying business. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can
