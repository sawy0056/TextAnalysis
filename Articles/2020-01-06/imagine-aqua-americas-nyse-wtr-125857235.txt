(NYSE:WTR) shareholders have enjoyed a 74% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 53% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 41% , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for Aqua America While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Aqua America actually saw its EPS drop 8.3% per year.Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The revenue growth of 1.6% per year hardly seems impressive. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:WTR Income Statement, January 5th 2020MoreWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies.

This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Aqua AmericaWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Aqua America's TSR for the last 5 years was 96%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Aqua America shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 41% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
