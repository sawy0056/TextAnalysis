But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. Long term Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 146% in five years. It's also up 8.9% in about a month. But this could be related to good market conditions -- stocks in its market are up 3.7% in the last month. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Northrop Grumman achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 20% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).NYSE:NOC Past and Future Earnings, January 5th 2020MoreIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Northrop Grumman's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Northrop Grumman's TSR for the last 5 years was 166%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Northrop Grumman shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 54% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 22% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
