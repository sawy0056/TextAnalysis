Pending home sales rose by 1.2% in November, with house prices on the rise in October.On the negative, however, was a fall in consumer confidence in December.

Iran’s response to events on Friday could drive demand for safe havens from the start of the week. Few expect Iran to sit back following the airstrike that killed its most senior military commander…Any escalation would sink mortgage rates, which would certainly drive demand for the refinance applications in the week. Uncertainty could limit any upside for new mortgage applications, however.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
