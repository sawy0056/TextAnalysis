These ensure maximum image and audio quality even in instances where users might typically experience a washout effect from brightness or distracting background noise. Features include:Superior Brightness: Powerful LED's illuminate a wide area, activated by motion or manually. 2K Video with HDR: Zoom in on objects and see clearer details and colors in 2K HDR during live or recorded video viewing. Color Night Vision: See what's lurking in the dark with color night vision or traditional black and white. 160-degree Diagonal View: Keep an eye on more of what matters with a wider field-of-view. 2-Way Audio: Hear and speak to visitors clearly with superior audio quality.

To do so, users can configure the ambient light sensor's sensitivity threshold to surrounding light within the Arlo app. This level of customization will in turn help users further preserve the product's battery life as well. The floodlight camera also offers three different light patterns – constant, flashing, and pulsating – which users can control manually on-demand or via automation rules.The Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Camera was designed with user convenience in mind and allows for easy installation in a variety of outdoor environments. Through its clean, unibody design, the floodlight camera offers a beautiful outer-body casing to seamlessly blend into any home exterior.
