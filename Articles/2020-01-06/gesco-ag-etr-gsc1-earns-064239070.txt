To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Gesco:0.11 = €42m ÷ (€534m - €162m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, Gesco has an ROCE of 11%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Are Current Liabilities, And How Do They Affect Gesco's ROCE?Current liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Gesco has total liabilities of €162m and total assets of €534m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 30% of its total assets. With this level of current liabilities, Gesco's ROCE is boosted somewhat.The Bottom Line On Gesco's ROCEWith a decent ROCE, the company could be interesting, but remember that the level of current liabilities make the ROCE look better.
