We'll show how you can use Constellation Software Inc.'s (TSE:CSU) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Based on the last twelve months, Constellation Software's P/E ratio is 49.06. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.0%. Check out our latest analysis for Constellation Software How Do I Calculate Constellation Software's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price (in reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Constellation Software:P/E of 49.06 = CA$973.03 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, USD ) ÷ CA$19.83 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each CA$1 of company earnings. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.How Does Constellation Software's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. As you can see below, Constellation Software has a higher P/E than the average company (18.0) in the software industry.TSX:CSU Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 5th 2020MoreConstellation Software's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Constellation Software's 52% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. The cherry on top is that the five year growth rate was an impressive 32% per year. With that kind of growth rate we would generally expect a high P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Constellation Software's Balance SheetNet debt totals just 1.0% of Constellation Software's market cap. So it doesn't have as many options as it would with net cash, but its debt would not have much of an impact on its P/E ratio.The Verdict On Constellation Software's P/E RatioConstellation Software trades on a P/E ratio of 49.1, which is multiples above its market average of 15.8. While the company does use modest debt, its recent earnings growth is superb. So on this analysis a high P/E ratio seems reasonable.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
