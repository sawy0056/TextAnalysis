"Johnson and Nixon lied about Viet Nam [sic]. Bush and Cheney lied about WMD's in Iraq. Now [Vice President Mike] Pence is lying about Iran/Soleimani's supposed involvement in 9/11."SAUDI ARAMCO HIT INTRADAY LOW AMID US-IRAN TENSIONSKerr was referring to a tweet in which the vice president claimed that Soleimani "assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States."Pence spokeswoman Katie Waldman told Fox News that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), under Soleimani's leadership, knowingly allowed 12 of the 9/11 hijackers to transit to Afghanistan.Kerr faced blowback for his statement."What about the Uighurs?" wrote NewsBusters editor Curtis Houck.Pence called the NBA a "wholly owned subsidiary" of President Xi Jinping's regime during an Oct. 24 speech. The vice president criticized a litany of Chinese actions, including the treament of Uighur Muslims and other religious minorities."Just what we need, political commmentary from the basketball champion Steve Kerr. I’m not surprised coach [intentionally] left out Obama’s assassination of Gaddafi because of an alleged threat while doing absolutely nothing regarding Assad in Syria," businessman John Burnett said in reponse to Kerr's tweet.Others found themselves agreeing with Kerr's message."As usual Steve Kerr is tight [sic]. Next time our govt. tells the truth about an act of war will be the first time since Normandy," sportswriter Ron Borges posted on Twitter on Saturday.FOX Business' inquiries to the NBA and the Golden State Warriors were not immediately returned.Fox News' Sam Dorman contributed to this report.Related ArticlesHow Much is Michael Phelps Worth?Ryan Lochte's Brand Value Sinks Amid Rio ScandalHere's How You Get a Body Like An OlympianReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTimberwolves fined by NBA for resting RussellOmnisportFox Nation host Britt McHenry reveals brain tumor, tells followers to get early MRIUSA TODAY EntertainmentJenelle Evans Reveals She Has a New Pet 9 Months After Her Ex Shot and Killed Her DogPeopleNBA fines Timberwolves $25K for resting RussellReutersHollywood-Supported Bullied Boy With Dwarfism Will Donate Funds To CharityDeadlineRichard Branson’s Wealth Falls to Earth as Virgin Galactic SputtersBloombergA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
