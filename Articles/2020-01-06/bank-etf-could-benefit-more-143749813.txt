The weighted average market value of KRE's components is $10.8 billion, implying price points that would be tolerable for would be suitors.Overall, there were 35 deals in the regional banking space last year – the highest tally since 1999 – and with the 2020 presidential election looming, buyers may be in a hurry to make purchases in the first half of this year.“Bankers might have a short window to get those deals done,” according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. “Regional bank M&A is experiencing something of a sweet spot after regulators lifted a key asset threshold. But that could change after the 2020 elections, leading to some predictions that large deals will be front-loaded in the year ahead.”Another catalyst for consolidation is that many of the most appealing regional banks, including some KRE holdings, have exposure to solid state economies such as Texas and Florida as well as other thriving areas of the Southeast.What's NextSome KRE components could make for attractive acquisition targets because they may need massive premiums to come to the table, an important factor in an environment where buyers are likely to be punished for overpaying.“Investors said banks are less likely to pursue a traditional takeover deal,” notes S&P Global Market Intelligence. “The market has reacted negatively to high-premium transactions where a large bank buys a smaller one at a price above market value.”Banking has also been fertile territory for consolidation. In 2000, there were nearly 10,000 U.S. banks. Today, that number is below 6,000.Related Links:A Nifty New REIT ETFOn Iran News, These ETFs Vexed Traders0See more from BenzingaIran Drama Threw A Curveball At Traders Using These ETFsA Rocking Robotics ETF For 2020© 2020 Benzinga.com.
