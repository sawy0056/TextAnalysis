But long term Grande West Transportation Group Inc (CVE:BUS) shareholders have had a particularly rough ride in the last three year.

More recently, the share price has dropped a further 11% in a month. View our latest analysis for Grande West Transportation Group Grande West Transportation Group isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.Over three years, Grande West Transportation Group grew revenue at 25% per year. That's well above most other pre-profit companies. In contrast, the share price is down 33% compound, over three years - disappointing by most standards. This could mean hype has come out of the stock because the losses are concerning investors. But a share price drop of that magnitude could well signal that the market is overly negative on the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).TSXV:BUS Income Statement, January 5th 2020MoreYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Grande West Transportation Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 37%, against a market gain of about 17%.
