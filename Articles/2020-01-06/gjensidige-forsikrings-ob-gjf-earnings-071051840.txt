But as Warren Buffett has mused, 'If you've been playing poker for half an hour and you still don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy.' When they buy such story stocks, investors are all too often the patsy.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like Gjensidige Forsikring (OB:GJF). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. See our latest analysis for Gjensidige Forsikring How Fast Is Gjensidige Forsikring Growing?As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Gjensidige Forsikring grew its EPS by 9.7% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of Gjensidige Forsikring's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Gjensidige Forsikring shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 13% to 25%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in my book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Gjensidige Forsikring.Are Gjensidige Forsikring Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?As a general rule, I think it worth considering how much the CEO is paid, since unreasonably high rates could be considered against the interests of shareholders. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Gjensidige Forsikring, with market caps over kr71b, is about kr14m.Gjensidige Forsikring offered total compensation worth kr9.0m to its CEO in the year to December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Gjensidige Forsikring Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As I already mentioned, Gjensidige Forsikring is a growing business, which is what I like to see. Not only that, but the CEO is paid quite reasonably, which makes me feel more trusting of the board of directors. So I do think the stock deserves further research, if not instant addition to your watchlist.
