By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Assystem S.A. (EPA:ASY).Our data shows Assystem has a return on equity of 7.1% for the last year. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each €1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made €0.07 in profit. See our latest analysis for Assystem How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Assystem:7.1% = €27m ÷ €384m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does Return On Equity Signify?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Assystem Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Assystem has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the Professional Services industry.ENXTPA:ASY Past Revenue and Net Income, January 5th 2020MoreUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. It is better when the ROE is above industry average, but a low one doesn't necessarily mean the business is overpriced. Nonetheless, it might be wise to check if insiders have been selling.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining Assystem's Debt And Its 7.1% Return On EquityAlthough Assystem does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.23 is still low. I'm not impressed with its ROE, but the debt levels are not too high, indicating the business has decent prospects. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Story continuesOf course Assystem may not be the best stock to buy.
