In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Turtle Beach:0.55 = US$25m ÷ (US$131m - US$85m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, Turtle Beach has an ROCE of 55%.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Do Turtle Beach's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Short term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Turtle Beach has total assets of US$131m and current liabilities of US$85m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 65% of its total assets. Turtle Beach's high level of current liabilities boost the ROCE - but its ROCE is still impressive.The Bottom Line On Turtle Beach's ROCEIn my book, this business could be worthy of further research.
