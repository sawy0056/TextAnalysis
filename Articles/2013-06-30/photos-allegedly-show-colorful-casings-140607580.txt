Take this one with a grain of salt, but there are images hitting the Apple sites that allege to show the colored back plates for the upcoming low-cost iPhone. We first saw the images on French site Nowhereelse.fr. It looks like they originate from WeiPhone. Apple has been rumored to be releasing a lower-cost iPhone to attack the mid-range of the smartphone market. It's also rumored that the new phone would come in a variety of colors. One thought on these images: Apple's new software, iOS 7 uses a bright new color palate. It would make a lot of sense visually if these bright, new-color iPhones matched the bright new colors of iOS 7. That said, take this with a grain of salt for now. We don't know much about the origins of the images. View photoscolor iphoneMoreNowwhereelseView photosiphone colorMoreNowwhereelseMore From Business Insider How iOS 7 Screwed Developers Who Make Apps For Both iPhone And AndroidThe Only Thing That's Going To Turn Apple's Stock AroundThis Is What Apple's Voice Recording App Will Look Like When The New iPhone Software Launches Later This Year
