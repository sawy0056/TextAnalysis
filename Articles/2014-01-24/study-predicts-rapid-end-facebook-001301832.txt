Remember when MySpace was all the rage until Facebook caught everyone’s fancy?A new study by Princeton University researchers predicts that Facebook may soon go the way of MySpace or, more accurately, die out like an infectious disease, reports NBC News.And the researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering predict the demise will be fast –– the social network will lose 80 percent of its peak user base between 2015 and 2017.Before you scoff, consider this snippet of the researchers’ rationale reported by multiple sources, including Time, “Ideas, like diseases, have been shown to spread infectiously between people before eventually dying out, and have been successfully described with epidemiological models.”So keep an eye on how many of your Facebook “friends” start to disappear from the social network. If the researchers are correct, their disappearance may foreshadow the end of Facebook.Does this prediction seem reasonable to you, or do you think you’ll still be hooked (assuming you are now)?
