VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jan 23, 2014) -
Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd. (TSX VENTURE:SCZ) (the "Company" or "Santacruz") announces that it has filed on SEDAR an independent NI 43-101 Technical Report titled "2013 Mineral Resource Estimate, Gavilanes Project, Durango, Mexico" (the "Report"), including the initial resource estimate for the Gavilanes silver project located in San Dimas, Durango, Mexico, as described in the Company's news release dated December 17, 2013.The Report, with an effective date of November 13, 2013, was prepared according to NI 43-101 guidelines and in accordance with CIM Standards, by independent qualified persons. The resource estimation was completed by Gary Giroux, P.Eng. of Giroux Consultants Ltd. and utilized a geological model completed by Hans Smit, P.Geo and Fletcher Bourke, P.Geo.Based upon a 75 gram per tonne ("g/t") silver equivalent ("AgEq") cut-off, the resources on three of seven known veins, Guadalupe, Descubridora and San Nicolas, as well as the El Hundido stockwork are as follows:
(tonnes) Ag (g/t) Au (g/t) Cu (%) Pb (%) Zn (%) Ag EQ (g/t) AgEq Oz
Indicated 953,000 164.6 0.09 0.06 0.42 0.41 200.5 6,143,000
Inferred 5,399,000 124.6 0.12 0.09 0.40 0.34 163.0 28,294,000
In addition the Report notes the following:Veins remain open along strike and to depth with intermittent surface exposures indicating an untested strike length; The El Hundido stockwork is open down-dip and to the south; Four unexplored veins offer additional potential. Further details are below and in the Report which is also available on www.sedar.com and the Company's website www.santacruzsilver.com.Arturo Préstamo, President and CEO, remarked, "The completion of this report is significant to the Company as it shows the potential the Company has in the future to add to its asset base. The drilling to date has only focused on a small portion of the more than 8,800+ hectare Gavilanes property. We remain committed to building a strong mid-tier silver producer with assets in Mexico and we will make prudent decisions in these difficult markets on the best methods to advance all of our assets."Mineral Resources: The tables below summarize results of the estimates and provide a range over various cut-off grades:

The metal prices used in the silver equivalent estimate are listed below.
Factor
Ag - US$ 21.55 per ounce 0.69 $/gm
Au - US$ 1318.00 per ounce 42.37 $/gm
Cu - US$ 3.25 per pound 71.65 $/%
Pb - US$ 0.97 per pound 21.38 $/%
Zn - US$ 0.87 per pound 19.18 $/%
The equation to establish Ag Equivalent is then:
AgEq = (Cu%x71.65)+(Pb%x21.38)+(Au g/tx42.37)+(Ag g/tx0.69)+(Zn%x19.18)
(0.69)
100% recovery has been assumed for all metals in the silver equivalent estimate. At this stage of the project no metallurgy has been completed and the reader is cautioned that 100% recoveries are never achieved.The Company has the right to acquire a 100% interest in the Gavilanes property, consisting of the Gavilanes I, Gavilanes II, and Gavilanes MHM Fraccion claim groups, pursuant to option agreements with three different property vendors. The Company must make aggregate cash payments of US$2,650,000 with respect to the Gavilanes I and Gavilanes II claim groups at various dates up to and including May 1, 2014, and a payment of US$1,000,000 on commencement of commercial production from the Gavilanes MHM Fraccion in order to fulfill the terms of the respective option agreements. In addition, the mineral claim vendors have retained net smelter royalties of 3%, 2% and 3% with respect to the Gavilanes I, Gavilanes II and Gavilanes MHM Fraccion, respectively. The 2% net smelter royalty on the Gavilanes II claim group is payable to a maximum of US$1,000,000 and may be purchased by the Company at any time for US$1,000,000.
