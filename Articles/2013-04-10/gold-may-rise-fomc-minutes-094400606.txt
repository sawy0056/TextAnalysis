Gold may rise as a dovish set of FOMC meeting minutes boosts anti-fiat demand. Crude oil looks to the fourth-quarter earnings docket to yield risk trend cues.Talking Points Gold, Silver May Rise as Dovish FOMC Minutes Stoke Anti-Fiat Demand
Crude Oil and Copper Look to Earnings Docket to Establish Risk Trends Commodity prices are little-changed in European trading hours, with prices in consolidation mode as markets digest yesterday’s gains. Looking ahead, the spotlight is on minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March FOMC meeting. A dovish tone against the backdrop of last week’s disappointing ISM and NFP data would reinforce the view that Ben Bernanke and company are in no hurry to slow their aggressive stimulus efforts. That may weigh on the US Dollar and boost anti-fiat demand for gold and silver. On the earnings front, reports from alcohol beverage maker Constellation Brands Inc and discount retailer Family Dollar Stores Inc may offer insight on the health of the US consumer against the backdrop of fiscal austerity following January’s payroll tax hike and the recent onset of “sequester” spending cuts. Industrial and construction supplies provider Fastenal Co will be looked upon as a gauge of overall global growth trends. Encouraging cues in line with the tone set by Alcoa Inc earlier in the week may boost risk appetite, offering a lift to cycle-sensitive crude oil and copper prices.Want to see economic data releases directly on your charts?
