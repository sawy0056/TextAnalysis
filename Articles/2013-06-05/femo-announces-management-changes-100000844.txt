"I look forward to continuing to grow our mosquito control footprint, both nationally and internationally.""I am equally proud to have my son Frank O'Neal lead FEMO Texas. Over the past few years, Frank has risen through the ranks and has proven to be the right choice to run our Dallas-Fort Worth MosquitoNix business. He has seen up close the dramatic increase of mosquitoes and West Nile virus cases here in Texas and understands how fast we have to move to provide our products and services to protect families living across the Metroplex," added O'Neal.Mosquito control is a fast growing industry due to changing weather patterns across North America and the emerging threat of mosquito borne illnesses.

The CDC also states that as of December 11, 2012, there were 1,739 human cases of West Nile virus in Texas, including 76 deaths.
