Crude oil and gold prices await the ISM Non-Manufacturing Composite gauge to offer guidance on the probability of a near-term reduction in Fed QE efforts.Talking Points Crude Oil, Copper to Follow Risk Trends as ISM Informs Fed Policy Bets
Gold and Silver May Decline if QE3 Taper Clues Support the US Dollar Commodity prices are treading water in European trade as investors look past a broadly in-line set of May Eurozone PMI revisions to turn their attention to the US calendar. The ISM Non-Manufacturing Composite gauge is in focus. Expectations suggest the pace of service-sector growth increased in May, snapping a two-month deceleration streak. An outcome in line with expectations is likely to amplify speculation about a near-term reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus efforts, weighing on risk appetite and punishing cycle-sensitive crude oil and copper prices. Gold and silver may likewise come under fire amid waning anti-fiat demand as bets on a cutback in asset purchases offer support to the US Dollar. An unexpectedly dismal print on the manufacturing component of the ISM data set released earlier in the week leaves the door open for a surprise however, which may yet offer support to risk trends and commodities alike. The Fed will also release its Beige Book regional economic conditions survey, which may temper or amplify the sentiment implications of the ISM release.Crude Oil Technical Analysis (WTI) - Prices declined as expected after putting in a bearish Dark Cloud Cover candlestick pattern.
