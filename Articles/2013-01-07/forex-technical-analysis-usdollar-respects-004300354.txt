Daily BarseliottWaves_us_dollar_index_body_usdollar.png, FOREX Technical Analysis: USDOLLAR Respects Channel ResistanceMoreChart Prepared by Jamie Saettele, CMTFOREXAnalysis: The USDOLLAR reversed right at channel resistance Friday. Price is already nearing initial support from former resistance at 10065. Estimated resistance is now 10113. Given the reaction at the channel, shorts are warranted into that level against Friday’s high towards 10013.FOREX Trading Strategy: I wrote last Thursday that “strength into the upward sloping channel resistance on NFP would warrant a near term short.” Focus is lower towards 10013. LEVELS: 9977 10013 10065 10157 10236 10323--- Written by Jamie Saettele, CMT, Senior Technical Strategist for DailyFX.comTo contact Jamie e-mail jsaettele@dailyfx.com.  Follow me on Twitter for real time updates @JamieSaetteleSubscribe to Jamie Saettele's distribution list in order to receive actionable FX trading strategy delivered to your inbox.
