Starwood Hotels & Resorts is facing an unusual bearish strategy while the stock trades just below its 2012 highs.A trader sold 2,500 February 65 calls for $0.48 against previous open interest of 418 contracts, according to optionMONSTER tracking systems. At the same time, he or she bought 2,800 May 57.50 puts for $2.85 against open interest of 213 at that strike. The result is a bearish combination trade, but one that uses different expirations and quantities. The selling of the nearer-term calls was likely done to take advantage of the greater time decay , and the overall position could very well be a type of protective collar on long shares.
