A BBC Radio 4 presenter was so overcome by emotion that he fell silent on air for more than ten seconds today after hearing a moving poem by the girlfriend of a French photographer killed in Syria.Paddy O’Connell struggled to compose himself following a reading of a love letter from Emilie Blachere to Remi Ochlik, who died alongside Sunday Times journalist Marie Colvin in the besieged city of Homs last year.After the end of the poem, which was read by Miss Blachere herself, the airwaves were plunged into silence for about 12 seconds before the presenter regained enough composure to speak again.His voice was choked with emotion as he gave the weather forecast and read the closing credits of Broadcasting House, Radio 4’s popular Sunday morning news programme.Mr O’Connell, 46, introduced the poem as a “love letter” written for the first anniversary of 28-year-old Mr Ochlik’s death in Syria on February 22 last year.It takes the form of a list of everything Miss Blachere, a reporter for Paris Match magazine, loved about the talented young photographer, who had previously worked in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.She lovingly describes Mr Ochlik’s “timid smile” and “almost feminine delicacy” as she recalls the many happy days they spent together.In the most moving section of the poem, Miss Blachere says: “I loved to hear you tell me how everything was going to be alright when I was depressed. If only I could hear you tell me that today.“I loved it so much how on February 10, a Friday, the last time we saw each other, you told me that I made you happy.“I could go on. I would have loved to spend my life adding to this list.”She continues: “We were prepared for everything, except for the worst. Ochlik, I don’t know how I can go on without you.“In Rome, you told me, ‘love is a weakness’. You were wrong. Today I feel strong.”The poem ends by quoting ‘Singin’ in the Rain’, the title song from one of Mr Ochlik’s favourite films.In the slightly abridged version of the love letter broadcast on Radio 4, Miss Blachere concluded: “My angel, take care of yourself. Take care of us.”After his lengthy pause following the reading of the poem, Mr O’Connell said: “Our thanks to Emilie Blachere. The weather: cloudy across the entire UK, sunny spells are possible almost anywhere.”Broadcasting House is available to listen to, in full, on the BBC iPlayer .More From Business Insider Finally A Gun Is Used To Stop A Crime Instead Of Killing Innocent People8 Questions That Predict If A Man Will Live A Happy LifeThe 10 Most Miserable States In America
