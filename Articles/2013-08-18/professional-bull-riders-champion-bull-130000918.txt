TULSA, OK --(Marketwired - August 18, 2013) - The streak has ended at 42!Bushwacker, the 1700-pound bull owned by Julio Moreno Bucking Bulls, dubbed the 'Baddest Body in Sports' by ESPN the Magazine's Body Issue and the first animal to be featured in the issue, was defeated in Tulsa, Okla. Saturday night by PBR star J.B Mauney at the Express Employment Professionals Classic presented by WinStar World Casino, part of the Professional Bull Riders Built Ford Tough Series.Mauney rode the 2011 World Champion Bull for 95.25 points to win the event and $46,605, but more notably, stopped the record-setting streak of Bushwacker, the bull some have called the best bucking bull ever.It took nine times, but finally the 26-year-old from Mooresville, N.C., made a full 8-second ride on his nemesis whose PBR-record of 42 consecutive buckoffs at BFTS events, and 56 in his career, have established him as the greatest.To watch the streak-ending ride, visit: http://www.pbr.com/en/media/videos/2013/8/jb-mauney-makes-history-riding-bushwacker-for-9525-points.aspx   "It's about time," proclaimed an elated J.B. Mauney, who said he's never felt as great as he did tonight in Tulsa where he won his first Built Ford Tough Series event of 2013 with a ride that will go down as one of the most memorable in PBR history.Kent Cox, Bushwacker's handler, and Mauney, whose skin was completely covered in goose bumps, embraced one another immediately afterward."If it had to be anybody it had to be J.B.," said Cox. Cox has hauled Bushwacker his entire career for owner Julio Moreno.Mauney came into the final round Saturday night in second place. After making his second qualified ride in the event, he said he was sticking to his original game plan, which he boldly stated would be selecting Bushwacker in the Built Ford Tough Championship Round."Everything's going great right now. When you feel good, you ride good," he said. "I'm picking the way J.B. picks [big picks in big moments]." Mauney had tied for fifth in the event during the opening round Friday night and then moved into first for most of the second round after riding Razorbuck (BMC Bucking Bulls/Owen Ranch) for 89.25 points. However, Round 1 winner Brendon Clark reclaimed the lead with an 86-point ride on Home Brew (Wolf Creek Cattle & Rodeo CO LLC) in the second round.Clark selected Showboat (Circle T Ranch & Rodeo) with the first pick in the championship round draft followed by Mauney's crowd-rousing selection of Bushwacker."Those first two bulls I had, I knew nothing about," said Mauney, who added that was how he had to approach his matchup with Bushwacker. "I have to just go at 'em jump for jump."Afterward he said it was a dogfight every second of the way.With every other rider, including Markus Mariluch, who was the last rider to make a qualified ride on Bushwacker in 2009 when the bull was only 3 years old, and every stock contractor cheering him on from the back of the bucking chutes, Mauney threw caution to the wind and disregarded every basic fundamental of bull riding."I was just hanging on," he admitted.Mauney won the Express Employment Professionals Classic with a three-bull total of 268.5 points. He was followed by Clark, who finished with 174.75 points. Jory Markiss was third and Sean Willingham was fourth, while Ben Jones and L.J. Jenkins rounded out the Top 5 by splitting fifth and sixth in the average.This win moves Mauney from 10th to sixth in the world standings in a matter of only two days.Bushwacker, the frontrunner for this year's World Champion Bull title, was the Pabst Blue Ribbon High-marked Bull of the event with 46.75 points.Tulsa was the 18th stop of 27 on the 2013 Built Ford Tough Series. Next week the series travels to Nashville, Tenn. for the Jack Daniel's Invitational, Aug. 24-25. The 2013 season will conclude at the World Finals in Las Vegas on Oct. 23-27, 2013 where the PBR World Champion will receive the coveted championship buckle, a new pick up from Ford and a $1 million bonus.The Built Ford Tough Series is televised every week on CBS, CBS Sports Network and networks around the world. BFTS telecasts are produced for the PBR under a multi-year agreement with David Neal Productions, a Los Angeles-based production company led by 34-time Emmy® Award winner and Peabody Award winner David Neal, who serves as executive producer.Professional Bull Riders Express Employment Professionals Classic presented by WinStar World Casino Tulsa, Okla.Event Leaders (Round 1-Event Points)...1.
