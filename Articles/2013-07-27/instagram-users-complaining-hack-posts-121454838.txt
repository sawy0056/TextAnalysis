Facebook Instagram Video AnnouncementMoreFacebookSome Instagram users took to Twitter last nigh to complain about a hack that posts photos of smoothies and fruits to users' timelines.Reports of the hack first started appearing on Twitter around 11 p.m. EST last night, The Verge reports.Update from an Instagram spokesperson:"Last night a small portion of our users experienced a spam incident where unwanted photos were posted from their accounts. Our security and spam team quickly took actions to secure the accounts involved, and the posted photos are being deleted." Sometimes the images are accompanied by text to suggest that the user is trying out a new diet. Some users have also reported being locked out of their accounts after trying to reset their passwords.Back in June, Instagram came under a similar fruit attack and was forced to prompt a lot of users to reset their passwords. Big security breach definitely happening on Instagram. This is the third hacked account I've seen including mine. pic.twitter.com/sWvoZBeVIo— Graham Hancock (@grahamhancock) July 27, 2013More From Business Insider New Video Shows Just How Hard That Southwest Flight Hit The Ground At LaGuardiaA Mysterious Hum Is Driving People Around The World CrazyTrain Driver Immediately After Spain Crash: 'I F---ed Up.
