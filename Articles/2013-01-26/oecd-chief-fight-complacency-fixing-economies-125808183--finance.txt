"We ran out of room on the monetary side, we've run out of room on the fiscal policy side, so what you need is to go structural. ""You need to go for education, for innovation, for more competition, for tax structures that are conducive to investments and job creation, you need to go for flexibility in the labor markets, for flexibility in the product markets," he said. "These are the things that are going to keep you going long term."The OECD is a group of 34 countries that seeks to promote global economic development. It is mostly made up of advanced economies such as the U.S., Britain, Germany and Japan, but also includes emerging economies like Chile, Mexico and Turkey.
