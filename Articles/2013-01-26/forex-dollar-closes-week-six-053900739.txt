Gold Sells Off for a Third Day, LTRO Spells Stimulus Reduction New to FX?Watch thisVideo; For live market updates, visitDailyFX’s Real Time News FeedDollar Closes Week at Six Month High, FOMC and GDP AheadDespite EURUSD’s final move through the end of this past week to clear 1.3400 and close at the highest level in 11 months, the dollar was rather strong. Over the same period, the greenback posted notable gains against the Japanese yen, British pound, Australian and Canadian dollars (it’s only meaningful losses were at the hands of the Euro and its counterpart Swiss franc). In turn, the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index (ticker = USDollar) ensured its own six-month high through the Friday’s close. This high alongside the US equity markets’ own outperformance to multi-year highs draws a stark contrast between speculative interests and the safe haven currency. This is a disparity unlikely to last.Over the coming week, there is a distinct possibility that underlying sentiment generates its own friction and subsequently drives risk trends and the reserve dollar back into opposition of each other. Yet, we will also have a round of meaningful data that can help accommodate such a change as well. From the US docket, the top listing for systemic impact is the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) rate decision. It is unlikely that we are in for a dramatic policy change considering the central bank had just affirmed monthly purchases of $85 billion in Treasuries and mortgage backed securities (MBS) at its previous meeting. However, the market is sensitive to nuance. In the previous minutes, we learned that there was debate as to when the stimulus effort could be reduced and closed. This timing will be even more important given the recent reduction in theEurozone’s stimulus programs (more on that below). More stimulus means higher money supply and risk – both USD negative.From the more traditional stock of market-movers, the US docket also holds the 4Q GDP release and January nonfarm payrolls (NFPs). The growth reading comes out the same day as the Fed decision for a competing effort for top fundamental theme. This past week, downgrades in IMF growth forecasts reminded the markets that output has been notable absent in the market’s scramble for more risk (a side effect of stimulus). Should the world’s largest economy offer an unexpectedly, dire reading; it may rouse the market to this meaningful disconnect. Alternatively, it could also lengthen the Fed’s support. The NFPs, will offer less influence on sentiment and instead carry more of a monetary policy sway. The Fed has said it will keep its ultra-loose policy in place until 6.5 percent unemployment and/or 2.5 percent CPI is achieved.Euro: LTRO Repayments a Bullish Factor Until Banks Need FundingThe Euro-area had embarked upon fiscal austerity long ago. Now it seems that there is also an element of financial austerity in the region as well. This past Friday, European banks that had received funds through the first of the ECB’s Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) stimulus program announced their intention to pay back the three-year loans early – they can repay starting a year after they were issued. According to the central bank, 278 firms would repay €137.2 billion of the capital. This was modestly larger than the consensus, which was the primary catalyst to EURUSD’s rally through 1.3400. A withdrawal of stimulus contradicts the approach taken by the ECB’s largest counterparts. In the FX market, that is a boon for the currency. On the other hand, there are downsides to this development as well. The downside of banks giving up their liquidity is that they have less buffer to adverse shocks going forward. EU Commissioner Rehn stated this past week that financing is the region’s greatest problem moving forward and Moody’s said Eurozone banks need more cash. A more subtle change to consider, this shift is now largely priced in. Less relief rally ahead. British Pound Holds Fast in Face of UK 4Q GDP Path to RecessionDespite the disappointing showing from the UK economic docket through the final trading day of this past week, the British pound showed considerable strength. Through the fourth quarter, the troubled economy shrank 0.3 percent – three times the consensus forecast – which led the annual pace of activity to stagnate. This stands as a cautionary tale for other countries that austerity does have a detrimental impact on the economy. If the BoE doesn’t act to offset the fiscal pain going forward, the sterling can find itself at the bottom of the pile. Japanese Yen Closes Incredible 11 Week Rally – Record Bullish MoveUSDJPY broke a record with this past week’s close. While the rebound for the pair through the second half of the week to a two-and-a-half-year high was impressive enough, the fact that such a move secured an 11th consecutive week rally was far more so. There is no precedence for such a consistent run going back to when the gold standard was dropped back in 1971. This move is quite clearly a yen depreciation drive as it is showing across the board. Japanese policy officials would be more than happy to keep the currency sliding, but their tools are spent for now. With the 13 trillion-per-month stimulus effort not starting until 2014, the crosses are exposed to any adverse risk trend developments. New Zealand Dollar Reaction to CPI Data Sets Up Interesting RBNZ DecisionThe week before last, the New Zealand dollar took a sizable tumble when the country’s statistical group reported a 0.2 percent drop in 4Q consumer inflation (CPI) that kept the annual figure to 0.9 percent. Well below the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) target, this threatened the latent hawkish lean for the high-yield currency. How much so? We will find out Wednesday at the rate decision. Australian Dollar Deviates from Risk TrendsThe Australian dollar took a tumble through the final trading day of this past week despite a consistent advance from the S&P 500 and even a stabilization of the Risk-Reward Index. In other words, this prominent carry trade currency is balking positive risk trends. The softening of interest rate forecasts likely carries some responsibility, but growth concern and possibly a reversal of ‘reserve’ capital flows likely guided this move.Gold Sells Off for a Third Day, LTRO Spells Stimulus ReductionWith the 0.6 percent drop through Friday, gold closed out a three-day decline. The precious metal’s bane this past week was a shift away from stimulus – an effort that devalues currencies and leverages the value of a hard asset like gold. Most notably, the passage of more time on the US debt ceiling and European banks’ repayment of some of its LTRO loans bolsters ‘fiat’ assets. The Fed may make up for it next week though. **For a full list of upcoming event risk and past releases, go to www.dailyfx.com/calendarECONOMIC DATA
