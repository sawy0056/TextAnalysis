Ten years ago, Victoria's Secret sold lingerie to women in their twenties. Today, the lingerie retailer is luring in young girls by offering underwear that is cute instead of sexy, reports Sapna Maheshwari at Bloomberg News. The highly-popular Pink line is technically marketed toward college girls ages 18 to 22. “When somebody’s 15 or 16-years-old, what do they want to be?” Stuart Burgdoerfer, CFO of Victoria's Secret, said at a conference last month. “They want to be older, and they want to be cool like the girl in college, and that’s part of the magic of what we do at Pink.”Victoria's Secret's marketing to teenagers was evident at its most recent fashion show.This year, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Bruno Mars performed at the show. All are young, relatively new artists with tracks on pop radio. Bieber was prominently featured and even sang an acoustic song, "As Long As You Love Me," on the stage by himself. Conveniently, the world's hottest teen idol also performed as the Angels modeled the merchandise for Pink. Other chains are also capitalizing on the teen lingerie trend.American Eagle's Aerie line is expanding rapidly, while Hot Topic released its line, Blackheart, to great success last year. More From Business Insider What Happens To Victoria's Secret Underwear After You Return ItSUV Slams Into Saks Fifth Avenue In ManhattanThe Luxury Pet Industry Is Out Of Control
