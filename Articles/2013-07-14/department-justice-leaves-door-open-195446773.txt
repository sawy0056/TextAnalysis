The Department of Justice’s Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation continue to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial. Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the Department’s policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.More From Business Insider George Zimmerman Gained A Massive Amount Of Weight Before His TrialRenowned Medical Expert: Zimmerman Got Hit In The Head At Least 6 TimesPOLICE: Zimmerman Said 'That Doesn't Even Sound Like Me' Screaming For Help
