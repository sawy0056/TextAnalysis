The gambling company also says there were too many conditions attached to the offer, such as due diligence, and a receipt of recommendation from the board."We have a unique business with a market position, profitability, cash flow and prospects that this proposal fails to recognise," Betfair Chairman Gerald Corbett wrote in a statement. "Our new management team are implementing the strategy announced in December 2012 and it is this that will realise value for shareholders."The company plans to give an udpate on May 7 to show the company's progress and how it's implementating its strategy, including cost efficiencies and its recent trading performance on the market.  More From Business Insider 10 Apps That Made My Life BetterMASS.
