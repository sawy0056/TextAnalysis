The company is showing a 13x trailing multiple of earnings, which is below the 18x industry average. The forward multiple of 30x is quite rich when compared to the 16x industry average, but is likely higher due to lower future outlook for earnings.The ChartThe 3 month chart below shows the stock doing the Wall Street equivalent of 'being discounted.'
