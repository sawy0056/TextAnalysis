Jefferies says its channel checks indicate BlackBerry cut build plans for BB10 handsets by at least another 10% a month after cutting them to 1M from 2M. The firm said it sees "significant risk" to consensus estimates over the next couple quarters and dropped its price target for shares to $15 from $18. However, Jefferies thinks investors will likely look past the earnings risk given the potential of a takeover and keeps a Buy rating on the stock.
