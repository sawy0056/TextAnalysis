Value Stocks Shine over Long PeriodsResearchers have come up with different explanations for the “value premium”, ever since Fama and French published their famous research paper in 1992, showing outperformance of value stocks over growth stocks over long term.Further, numerous academic studies conducted since then have shown that value stocks have delivered higher returns with lower volatility compared with growth stocks over the long term in almost all the markets studied. (Read: 3 Excellent ETFs for Growing Dividends)Does that mean that investors should ignore growth stocks? Not at all; growth stocks shine in certain market cycles and value stocks in some others. But given their proven performance over long term, value stocks and funds should be a predominant part of any ‘core’ portfolio.Also, while some of the small cap companies have high return potential, they are mostly risker and require frequent monitoring, and on the other hand established large cap companies with solid balance sheets and stable cash flows are less risky and thus more suitable for long term investors.

We may add that expense ratio is not the only cost involved in investing in an ETF but it usually is the major cost but investors need to look at other implicit costs too in addition to expense ratio.Below, we have analyzed three large cap value ETFs with ultra-low expense ratios that should be considered by investors for their long-term, core portfolios.Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Value ETF (SCHV)SCHV provides broad exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks with value style characteristics, representing about half of the market capitalization of stocks in the Dow Jones U.S. Large Cap Total Stock Market Index.Launched in December 2009, the fund has so far been able to attract assets worth $713.4M, which are invested in 356 holdings.
