BANGKOK (AP) -- Asian stock markets were little changed Monday as traders weighed the consequences of an anticipated phasing out of the U.S. central bank's unprecedented stimulus program.The Federal Reserve has been aggressively buying government bonds to push down interest rates and return employment to normal levels after millions lost jobs in the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis.The Fed says the program has helped stimulate the economy by making it easier to buy homes and invest in businesses. The Fed has also said the program is not indefinite and will be phased out when the economy improves.Recent economic data and public statements by Fed policymakers have led investors to conclude that the Fed will begin winding down its $85 billion a month in bond purchases starting as early as September. Falling bond yields in the U.S is one sign that traders believe the Fed's move is imminent.But analysts said a sharp increase in the cost of credit could stifle growth, which will make the transition tricky and could make stock markets shaky."If it looks like the removal of funding is having too much of an adverse effect on the local economy it (the Fed) will have to step back in; or the more likely scenario, it will extend the timeframe for the complete removal of monetary stimulus," said Evan Lucas of IG in Melbourne, Australia.Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent to 13,706.36.
