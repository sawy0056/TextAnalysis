The site reports:Apple is testing a local, offline version of Dictation voice input for iOS devices, according to strings of code found inside of the iOS 7 beta.... While we do not have evidence of this, it seems plausible that Apple could eventually port over this technology from Dictation to Siri. This would allow certain queries to Siri to take place at a quicker pace.That could be huge for Siri in its fight with Google Now, the voice-command system on Android phones which often delivers more accurate results than Siri does.More From Business Insider Get Ready For 'An Army Of New Products This Fall' From Apple, Says An Apple SourceDon't Get Excited About These Pictures Of A 'Budget iPhone' Made From Plastic — They Could Be FakeTim Cook Is Planning 'Sweeping Changes' For Apple Stores To Get Employees To Sell More iPhones
