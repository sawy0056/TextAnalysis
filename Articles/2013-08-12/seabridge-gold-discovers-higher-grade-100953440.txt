Seabridge Gold announced that it has discovered a very large, higher-grade core zone at Deep Kerr on its 100%-owned KSM project in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. Sitting down dip and in part continuous from the Kerr deposit, Deep Kerr is reporting significant mineralized intervals containing total metal values per tonne that are approximately two times KSM's proven and probable reserve average, with some intervals exceeding 1.0% copper and gold grades as high as 1.7 grams per tonne.
