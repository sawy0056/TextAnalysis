The rapid growth of its customer base indicates a tremendous appetite for InsideView solutions, and our due diligence conversations with InsideView customers revealed a clear impact on revenue and productivity, to a degree we rarely, if ever, see."The CRM market leads all enterprise software categories, and is projected to grow to a $36 billion market by 2017, according to Gartner Research*. Earlier this year, CSO Insights found that 63% of sales reps' time is spent in non-sales activities such as research. Worse, only about 60% make quota.
