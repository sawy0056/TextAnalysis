SUGAR LAND, TX--(Marketwired - Aug 12, 2013) - Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- While we often think of sugar as something that we simply put in our coffee or eat in chocolate bars, most people don't realize the incredible size, escalating growth and geopolitical implications of the Sugar Industry. Industrial Info is currently tracking more than $40 billion in active Sugar Industry projects throughout the world, and this number is expected to continue increasing.As the global population continues to grow and a middle-class population emerges from developing economies, demand for sugar as a food product is increasing. While consumption grows in the more affluent populations, sugarcane and sugar beets are often farmed in the areas of lowest cost, which tend to be rural populations with little infrastructure. The farming of sugar crops provides income to these communities, while associated power projects allow for the development of infrastructure in these areas, fueling further economic growth and industrial development.On this edition of "Navigating the Currents of Change," Randy Godet, Industrial Info's vice president of Food & Beverage Industry Research, speaks with Tom Fordham, who has had years of experience in the Sugar Industry, including the development of regional sugar production and the construction of processing facilities across the world.Learn about the "hotspots" of the industry where development is poised to take off, and why countries with a mature Sugar Industry will continue to invest in growing this important global industry.Make sure to visit Industrial Info at the Fenasucro Conference and Exhibition in Sao Paulo, Brazil, August 27-30. The Fenesucro show is one of the world's most important Sugar Industry tradeshows, held in the country that has what is perhaps the world's largest sugar industry. Stop by and see us at Booth #BJ46!Industrial Info Resources (IIR), with global headquarters in Sugar Land, Texas, and eight offices outside of North America, is the leading provider of global market intelligence specializing in the industrial process, heavy manufacturing and energy markets.
