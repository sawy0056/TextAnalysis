Scotland benefits as part of the UK from being able to pool resources."The oil and gas industry employed 450,000 people in the UK and should do so for years to come, he added.Angus Robertson, a pro-independence lawmaker from the Scottish National Party, said his expectations ahead of the government's Scottish cabinet meeting were low."Think that after first UK Cabinet visit to north of Scotland since the 1920s there'll be a thank you for the oil and whisky tax billions?" he asked on Twitter.
