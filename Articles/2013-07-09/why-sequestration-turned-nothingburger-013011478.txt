It turns out, they're more limited than people expected —which is why they haven't been holding the economy back much.Furloughs are almost entirely limited to the Department of Defense and the Internal Revenue Service. In all, SocGen expects 850,000 federal workers to be furloughed for an average of 10.5 days. That's equivalent to the loss of 35,000 full-time jobs—just a small blip on the overall economic picture.Here's the department-by-department table showing who's getting furloughed and who isn't:View photosScreen shot 2013 07 08 at 11.51.35 AMMoreSociete GeneraleSequestration isn't a smart policy.
