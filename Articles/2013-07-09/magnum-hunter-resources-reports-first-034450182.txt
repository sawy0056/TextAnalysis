MHR.PRE ) (the "Company" or "Magnum Hunter") announced today financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2013. Highlights for the three months include the following:Total revenue increased 76% to $98.0 million for the first quarter of 2013, as compared to total revenue of $55.7 million for the first quarter of 2012 Adjusted EBITDAX(a) was $55.4 million for the first quarter of 2013, a 63% increase over the first quarter of 2012 Recurring net loss(a) of ($0.06) per diluted share for the first quarter of 2013, as compared to recurring net loss of ($0.02) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2012 Production of 13,769 BOEPD and pro forma production(b) of 16,889 BOEPD for the first quarter of 2013, representing a 9% and 34%, increase, respectively, over the actual first quarter production of 2012 (a) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations below(b) Based on including with actual production 3,120 BOEPD of temporary shut-ins in Appalachia due to pipeline and liquid handling issuesThe Company plans to file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 with the Securities and Exchange Commission tomorrow, July 9, 2013.Financial and Production Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013Magnum Hunter reported an increase in revenues of 76% to $98.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $55.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This increase in revenues was driven primarily by increases in our oil and natural gas liquids production as a result of previous acquisitions, and increased drilling activity in our unconventional resource plays as well as the Company's increased focus on oil and liquids projects during 2012.The Company reported a net loss of $57.7 million attributable to common shareholders or ($0.34) per basic and diluted common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to a net loss of $17.1 million, or ($0.13) per basic and diluted common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2012. When adjusted for non-cash and non-recurring expenses of $47.1 million, the Company's recurring net loss attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2013, was $10.6 million or ($0.06) per basic and diluted common shares outstanding (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations below).For the three months ended March 31, 2013, Magnum Hunter's Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Exploration ("Adjusted EBITDAX") was $55.4 million as compared to $34.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX was primarily due to both an overall production increase and an increased focus on oil and liquids projects which substantially increased oil and natural gas liquids revenues. However, natural gas production shut-ins, higher lease operating expenses per BOE, and higher non-recurring cash general and administrative costs (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations below) per BOE partially offset the increase. The increase in LOE costs per BOE was primarily due to new oil wells placed on production which generally have higher lease operating costs per BOE than do natural gas wells. General and administrative expenses increased overall during 2013 mainly due to accounting personnel and professional services necessitated by the recent growth of the Company.Oil and gas production increased 9% for the three months ended March 31, 2013 to 1.239 million barrels of oil equivalent ("MMBoe") or 13,769 barrels of oil equivalent per day ("Boepd") (61% oil/liquids) as compared to the 1.149 MMBoe or 12,624 Boepd reported for the three months ended March 31, 2012. On a pro forma basis, production increased 34% to 16,889 Boepd including production shut-ins of 3,120 BOEPD as described below. The increase in production was primarily attributable to prior acquisitions, but more importantly, the Company's successful drilling program in its shale plays. In addition, the Company's oil/liquids production mix increased to 61% of overall production in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 35% in the first quarter of 2012. This change is a result of the shift in our capital expenditure program toward an oil and liquids rich development program.As noted above, in the first quarter of 2013, the Company's production was significantly impacted by production shut-ins in the Appalachian division primarily due to pipeline and liquid handling issues relating to the Company's midstream gathering facilities. These production shut-ins resulted from the presence of significantly greater liquids in the Company's natural gas production than originally anticipated. As a result, Eureka Hunter Pipeline, our midstream subsidiary, was required to re-engineer a portion of its gathering lines. Once Eureka Hunter Pipeline completed the capital project program, production was further delayed due to requirements for new air permits and lengthy delays in obtaining such permits from the State of West Virginia. The production shut-ins negatively impacted first quarter 2013 production by approximately 3,120 Boepd; thus, including the shut-in production volumes, first quarter 2013 production would have been approximately 16,889 Boepd. All liquids handling issues associated with the production of our Marcellus natural gas were resolved in May 2013, and the pipeline is fully operational with all natural gas and natural gas liquids now being processed at MarkWest's Mobley processing facility.Story continuesCapital Expenditures and LiquidityMagnum Hunter's total upstream and midstream capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions and Eagle Ford Shale capital expenditures (which were recouped on April 24, 2013, through purchase price adjustments as a result of the January 1, 2013 effective date of sale) were $75.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. Total upstream capital expenditures were $56.0 million with $31.9 million for the Williston Basin, $21.6 million for the Appalachian region and $2.5 million for the South Texas region. As a result of our Eagle Ford Shale properties sale, the Company reallocated its 2013 upstream capital expenditure budget of $300 million, with $150 million allocated to the Appalachian Basin, almost all of which is allocated to its Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale plays, and $150 million allocated to its Williston Basin/Bakken Shale play. The Company has allocated a significant portion of its 2013 upstream capital budget to the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale plays to take advantage of its processing capacity which went live in December 2012 at the MarkWest Mobley processing plant. In addition, the Company, in the first quarter of 2013, spent $19.0 million for the expansion of the Eureka Hunter Gas Gathering System.As a result of the Company's internally generated cash flows and availability under its Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Magnum Hunter has sufficient liquidity to fund its fiscal 2013 upstream capital budget of $300 million. As of June 30, 2013, the Company had total cash liquidity of approximately $310.8 million which is comprised of approximately $45.8 million of cash and $265.0 million of borrowing availability under its Senior Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Company currently owns 10 million shares of common stock of Penn Virginia (with current market value of $50.4 million based on the closing price of $5.04 per share as of July 5, 2013). In order to enhance our liquidity and reduce leverage, the Company intends to divest up to $100 - $200 million of non-core assets in 2013 and 2014. The Company also intends to pursue monetizing its ownership in Eureka Hunter Pipeline, its midstream subsidiary, commencing in the third quarter of 2013.Management CommentsMr. Gary C. Evans, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Magnum Hunter Resources, commented, "Our management team and Board are pleased to complete this first quarter 2013 financial statement filing. We accomplished this goal within our previously stated thirty day plan. As reflected in this filing, internal control issues are being addressed, and we intend to refocus our time and efforts on growing our production from our substantial asset base with our current drilling plans. Actual production for this first quarter was substantially impacted by shut-ins necessary in our Appalachian Division due to midstream gathering issues. While the problem was troublesome and required additional pigging launchers to be installed due to heavy NGL and liquids production found in our new Marcellus wells current gas stream, this is a good problem in that this should prove beneficial over time with greater overall liquids production. We are confident that our leasehold acreage positions in both the Williston Basin and Marcellus/Utica Shale Plays will reflect great production growth as the year unfolds."Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresMagnum Hunter defines Adjusted EBITDAX as earnings before (1) exploration and abandonment expense, (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, (3) non-recurring transaction and other expense, (4) impairments of oil and gas properties, (5) unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives, (6) unrealized (gain) loss on investments, (7) (gain) loss on sale of assets, (8) interest expense and fees, (9) income tax benefit and (10) non-cash stock compensation expense and 401-K matching. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP.Magnum Hunter defines recurring income (loss) per common share as reported net loss attributable to common shareholders, plus non-recurring and non-cash items which include (1) exploration and abandonment expense, (2) impairment of oil and gas properties, (3) non-cash stock compensation expense, (4) non-recurring transaction and other expense, (5) unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives, (6)unrealized (gain) loss on investments, (7) interest expense - fees, (8) (gain) loss on sale of assets, (9) income tax expense (benefit), (10) (gain) loss from sale of discontinued operations and (11) income (loss) from discontinued operations.Magnum Hunter defines recurring cash G&A as total general and administrative expenses before (1) non-cash stock compensation and (2) transaction and other non-recurring expense.Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate evaluation of the Company's business on a "normalized" or recurring basis and without giving effect to certain non-cash expenses and other items, thereby providing management, investors and analysts with comparative information for evaluating the Company in relation to other oil and gas companies providing corresponding non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures for financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and that the reconciliations to the closest corresponding GAAP measure should be reviewed carefully.About Magnum Hunter Resources Corporation Magnum Hunter Resources Corporation and subsidiaries are a Houston, Texas based independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, primarily in the states of West Virginia, Ohio, North Dakota, Kentucky, Texas and Saskatchewan, Canada.
