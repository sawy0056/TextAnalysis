They grew 1.2 percent in January from the previous month, far above the 0.2 percent investors were expecting. Economists said the gain was likely fueled by post-holiday discounts and warned consumer spending is unlikely to remain that strong in coming months.By late morning in Europe, Germany's DAX was up 1.6 percent to 7,816.67 while France's CAC-40 was 1.4 percent higher at 3,760.28. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.7 percent to 6,389.41.Wall Street was poised to open higher, with Dow Jones industrial futures rising 0.3 percent to 14153 and S&P 500 futures advancing 0.2 percent to1529.Earlier in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.1 percent to 22,560.50. The mainland's Shanghai Composite Index jumped 2.3 percent to 2,326.31 and the Shenzhen Composite Index added 2.3 percent to 964.68 after Wen's pledge to support growth.In his speech, Wen mentioned subsidies for agriculture and energy conservation. He also pledged to relax the credit supply, analysts said."I think that is good news for the banks. Either they will increase their quota for new loans or reduce the deposit reserve ratio. So that means boosting the money supply to support economic growth," said Francis Lun, managing director of Lyncean Holdings in Hong Kong.Lun also said he believes China's leaders are aiming for something higher than the 7.5 percent growth target announced at the congress.Stocks in Tokyo rose on hopes that the Bank of Japan, which begins a two-day meeting on Wednesday, might demonstrate a shift in monetary policy to conform to the program championed by new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
