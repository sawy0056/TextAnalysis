BANGKOK (AP) — Asian stock markets rose Tuesday as investors registered approval for China's spending priorities announced at its annual congress.Markets in Hong Kong and mainland China drew encouragement from a speech by outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao and presentation of the country's budget at the opening of the annual National People's Congress, a largely ceremonial legislature.Wen promised deficit spending to meet a growth target this year of 7.5 percent that is enshrined in the ruling Communist Party's latest five-year development plan. Wen mentioned subsidies for agriculture and energy conservation and said the country was committed to fighting corruption and improving the environment.Banking shares were mostly higher after Wen also pledged to relax the credit supply, analysts said. Bank of China rose 1.1 percent. Agricultural Bank of China advanced 1 percent."I think that is good news for the banks. Either they will increase their quota for new loans or reduce the deposit reserve ratio. So that means boosting the money supply to support economic growth," said Francis Lun, managing director of Lyncean Holdings in Hong Kong. Lun also said he believes China's leaders are aiming for something higher than the 7.5 percent growth target announced at the congress.Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent to 22,597.06.
