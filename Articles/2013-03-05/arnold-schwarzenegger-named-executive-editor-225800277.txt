Arnold Schwarzenegger can add "editor" to his already varied resumé.The body builder-turned-actor-turned-politician will now serve as executive editor of Muscle & Fitness and Flex magazines, American Media Inc. announced.“It was in these magazines that I found the spark that inspired me to start lifting weights, and eventually move to America and realize my dreams, and I’m proud to return as executive editor,”
said Schwarzenegger in a statement .“Bodybuilding has always been part of my life," he added. "I know Muscle & Fitness and Flex will continue to motivate others - as it did me - to lift weights and lead a healthy lifestyle, promote the sport of bodybuilding, and, as Joe used to say in every issue, 'exceed themselves.'"Schwarzenegger, who will become group executive editor and a monthly columnist for the mags, briefly held the same position a decade ago.But shortly after winning his gubernatorial election, he resigned amid criticism that there would be a conflict of interest given the publications’ dependence on advertising for dietary supplements and the governor’s role in regulating the industry.But now  —  the former body building champ who has appeared on the magazines’ covers more than 60 times  —  is back.More From Business Insider Read Tori Spelling's Scathing Open Letter To Star After Her Kids Saw Divorce HeadlineSteven Spielberg Chosen To Head Cannes Film Festival Jury — Here's Today's BuzzSix-Year-Old Suri Cruise Appears To Have A Body Double
