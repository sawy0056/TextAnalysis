VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Aug 9, 2013) - Matrix Asset Management Inc. (the "Company" or "Matrix") (MTA.TO) announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") has informed Matrix that it will review the eligibility of the Common shares of the Company with respect to continued listing on the TSX. This review affects only Matrix Common shares and does not affect any of the funds managed by subsidiaries of Matrix.The TSX initiated its delisting review because the market value of publicly held Common shares of Matrix fell below levels required under TSX rules. The TSX will undertake the review pursuant to its continued listing criteria, including criteria with respect to Matrix's financial condition and operating results and the market value of the Matrix's Common shares. The Company will be granted 120 days in which to regain compliance with all requirements for continued listing. If the TSX determines that Matrix's Common shares should be delisted, Matrix may consider alternative listing arrangements. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of the delisting review or as to whether Matrix Common shares will remain listed on the TSX or as to whether an alternative listing will be achieved."Reducing Matrix's working capital deficit is a priority for Matrix. The previously announced agreement to sell the management and related contracts for the Matrix Funds to Marquest Asset Management Inc. (the "Marquest Transaction") is scheduled to complete by August 31, 2013. The Marquest Transaction and a debt financing arrangement Matrix announced on August 8, 2013 are both expected to help improve the Company's working capital position and support Matrix's efforts to remain listed," said David Levi, President and CEO of Matrix.On August 8, 2013, Matrix entered into a debt financing arrangement for up to $5.0 million of which $1.0 million was advanced at closing (the "August 2013 Financing").
