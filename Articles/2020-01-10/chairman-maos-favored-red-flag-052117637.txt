It plans to sell 200,000 units this year, 400,000 units in 2022 and 600,000 units in 2025, Xu said. Hongqi also plans to develop its own ride-sharing service.In 2030, FAW, which has partnerships with Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> and Toyota <7203.T>, overall aims to sell around 800,000 to a million units, the 55-year-old Xu said.Hongqi's ambitious sales targets, however, come as China's car market is set to fall for a second year in a row. The market is expected to contract by around 8% in 2019 and drop again this year.(Reporting by Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextVirus detected in sub-Saharan Africa, global stocks tankAFPVirus game 'Plague' app pulled in China: developerAFPBTS cancel concerts as South Korea coronavirus cases pass 2,000AFPNations take drastic measures as coronavirus outbreak spreadsMarketWatchAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
