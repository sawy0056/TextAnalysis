This could encompass babysitting children or caring for senior citizens.Inclusive Value LedgerThe digital currency would run on top of the project’s “Inclusive Value Ledger” (IVL). The team has called for New York State to distribute $55 billion per year that is uncollected in individual tax credits through the “public Venmo”.The IVL is an administered, non-extractive payment system which would enable recipients to spend freely within the New York economy without transaction fees or delays.In effect, every business and individual in the state would be given a virtual wallet that is connected to a state government-controlled master wallet.This would then serve as an alternative to a bank account minus the fees a bank would take for profit, reports Vice.Kim, Salazar, and Hockett argue that unlike Facebook’s Libra, the IVL statewide cryptocurrency would encourage the recirculation of money in low-income communities since it is a complementary currency to the US dollar.This would mean it operates on a hyper-local scale and keeps money rooted in one particular area, supporting local economic growth.Hockett writes in the whitepaper for the IVL that the peer-to-peer payment technology needed to underpin a project such as this already exists.The proposal emphasises that the payment system will be secure, but it does not provide details on how security will be carried out or how the project aims to meet the privacy needs of those it hopes to serve.Interested in reading more New York-related stories?
