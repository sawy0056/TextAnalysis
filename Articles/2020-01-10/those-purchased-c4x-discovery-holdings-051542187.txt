Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson. Check out our latest analysis for C4X Discovery Holdings C4X Discovery Holdings isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.In the last three years, C4X Discovery Holdings saw its revenue grow by 108% per year, compound. That is faster than most pre-profit companies. So on the face of it we're really surprised to see the share price down 47% a year in the same time period. You'd want to take a close look at the balance sheet, as well as the losses. Ultimately, revenue growth doesn't amount to much if the business can't scale well.
