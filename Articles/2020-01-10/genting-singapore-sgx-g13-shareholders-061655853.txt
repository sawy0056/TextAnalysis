But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the Genting Singapore Limited (SGX:G13) share price is down 10% in the last year. That's well bellow the market return of 7.1%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 1.1% in the last three years. See our latest analysis for Genting Singapore In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Unhappily, Genting Singapore had to report a 7.6% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price decline of 10% is actually more than the EPS drop. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, a year ago.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).SGX:G13 Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how Genting Singapore has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling Genting Singapore stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Genting Singapore the TSR over the last year was -6.8%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 7.1% in the last year, Genting Singapore shareholders lost 6.8% (even including dividends) . Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.0%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.
