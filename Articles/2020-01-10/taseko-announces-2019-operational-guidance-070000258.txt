In the fourth quarter, production totaled 33.4 million pounds of copper and 700 thousand pounds of molybdenum, similar to the levels achieved in the prior quarter. Total sales for the year were 122 million pounds of copper and 2.8 million pounds of molybdenum. Throughput in the fourth quarter was at design capacity and grade was approximately life of mine average.Russell Hallbauer , CEO and Director of Taseko, stated, "We are pleased to have met the annual production guidance that we provided 12 months ago. We achieved our production target for the year despite the CN Rail strike in November, which impacted Gibraltar concentrate shipments for 11 days and also forced us to adjust our mine plan to reduce production due to limited concentrate storage capacity. As a result, fourth quarter production and sales were slightly lower than plan. Concentrate inventory at year end remained similar to the previous quarter level.""We also issued a new form of reclamation security for Gibraltar , which resulted in $36 million of cash being released to Taseko in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, with a stronger copper price than what was averaged in 2019, combined with lower treatment and refining costs, we expect an improved operating margin to begin the new year."Note: Gibraltar is a Joint Venture owned by Taseko (75%) and Cariboo Copper Corp. (25%). All production and sales figures in this release are reported on a 100% basis, unless otherwise noted.Russell Hallbauer Chief Executive Officer and DirectorNo regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of the information contained in this news release.CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThis document contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (collectively, "forward looking statements") that were based on Taseko's expectations, estimates and projections as of the dates as of which those statements were made.
