You will need to purchase shares before the 13th of January to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 17th of January.Clas Ohlson's next dividend payment will be kr3.12 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of kr6.25 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Clas Ohlson has a trailing yield of 5.5% on the current stock price of SEK112.7. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Clas Ohlson's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Clas Ohlson If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. An unusually high payout ratio of 251% of its profit suggests something is happening other than the usual distribution of profits to shareholders. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Clas Ohlson generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 29% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's good to see that while Clas Ohlson's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Extraordinarily few companies are capable of persistently paying a dividend that is greater than their profits.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.OM:CLAS B Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MoreHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Clas Ohlson's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 17% a year over the previous five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Clas Ohlson has delivered an average of 7.6% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past ten years of dividend payments. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Clas Ohlson is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.The Bottom LineIs Clas Ohlson an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It's not a great combination to see a company with earnings in decline and paying out 251% of its profits, which could imply the dividend may be at risk of being cut in the future. Yet cashflow was much stronger, which makes us wonder if there are some large timing issues in Clas Ohlson's cash flows, or perhaps the company has written down some assets aggressively, reducing its income. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.Story continuesEver wonder what the future holds for Clas Ohlson?
