But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Logan Property Holdings (HKG:3380), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing.
