In just five years, sales surpassed 0.7 billion RMB in China's already saturated ladies apparel market.Kevin Wong, Founder and CEO of CC Universe reflects on the product development challenges presented to their multi-business brand:"Our multi-brand and multi-business model corporate development strategy would have created an enormous workload if we continued to operate with disparate systems and offline data. The company's priority is establishing a sharing platform that allows us to store all product creative and data."Today, with Centric's Fashion PLM in place, there is a streamlined way for CC Universe to obtain consistent data. Team members can track product development by brand and business model, which greatly improves the management capacity of their Product Center.Adrian Lian, who heads CC Universe's IT Department, comments on Centric's synergy with innovation, "Centric Fashion PLM has always been at the forefront of applications and innovations in the fashion and retail industry.
