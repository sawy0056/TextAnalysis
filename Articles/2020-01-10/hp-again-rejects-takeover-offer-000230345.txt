The debt commitment “is not a basis for discussion,” HP said Wednesday in a letter to Xerox Chief Executive Officer John Visentin. “The HP Board of Directors remains committed to advancing the best interests of all HP shareholders and to pursuing the most value-creating opportunities.”Xerox said Citigroup Inc., Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. provided the financing for the Norwalk, Connecticut-based printer maker to pursue its $22-per-share cash-and-stock acquisition bid.HP has repeatedly snubbed the offer, saying its announced restructuring plan will provide greater value to shareholders. Xerox has left open the possibility of sparking a proxy fight or introducing a tender offer to close the deal.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextJPMorgan Joins Rush to Curb Global Travel as Virus SpreadsBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergHere’s Where Investors Have Found Refuge in the Market StormBloombergFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergStudents Step Up Protests Against Thailand’s Army-Backed PremierBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
