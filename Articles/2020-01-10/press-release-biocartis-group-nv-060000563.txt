The second one is a master development and commercialization agreement with
Kite Pharma4 which aims at the development of molecular-based assays on the Idylla™ platform that are supportive to Kite’s therapies.Idylla™ publications – In 2019, the performance of Idylla™ was the subject of over 45 Idylla™ publications, of which several were selected for publication at large scientific conferences such as ESMO5 (European Society for Medical Oncology), ASCO6 (American Society of Clinical Oncology) and AMP7 (Association of Molecular Pathology).Herman Verrelst, Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis, commented: "After a rather turbulent Q3, we had a solid Q4, thanks to which we can today announce that we achieved our 2019 objectives in line with the latest guidance that we issued in September. The performance that we have seen in the US in Q4 is encouraging and indicates that the implementation of our new go-to market strategy is on track to further drive commercialization in that market. Our commercial strategies for Europe and Rest of World markets have continued to translate in good growth rates. Next to that, we are executing our commercialization plans for China and Japan. All these market penetration efforts in combination with anticipated further test menu expansion, including through menu partnerships, are expected to provide a solid basis for further growth in the coming years.”  Biocartis will publish its 2019 full year results and 2020 guidance on 5 March 2020.
