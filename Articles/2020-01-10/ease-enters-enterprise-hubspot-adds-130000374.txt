New revenue attribution reporting, AI-powered A/B testing, partitioning, and account-based marketing tools now available in Marketing Hub Enterprise empower companies to execute their boldest 2020 marketing plans, without the outdated user experience that comes with legacy systems.(PRNewsfoto/HubSpot, Inc.)MoreEase-of-Use Enters the EnterpriseBusiness leaders today are not realizing the full benefits of their technology investments. A major cause of this underutilization, according to Accenture, is the "enormous challenge of innovating with legacy systems." Growing businesses cannot afford to leave any potential power untapped, and cannot expect to stay competitive in 2020 with tools that slow them down precisely at the moment they need to be moving faster. Most enterprise software users today face sluggish load times, counter-intuitive designs, unnecessarily complex processes, and all-round clunkiness, when what they need from their software is the ability to put their most innovative ideas into action, quickly.HubSpot outranks all other enterprise marketing software providers in G2.com's Winter 2020 Grid Report for Marketing Automation, and is today offering growing businesses a modern enterprise solution that allows them to take full advantage of the powerful tools at their disposal."Marketing teams today use only a fraction of the potential power available in their tech stacks," said Nicholas Holland, General Manager, Marketing Hub at HubSpot. "The cause of this? Horribly outdated software systems that marketers avoid using whenever they can. I'm delighted that with this upgraded version of Marketing Hub Enterprise, we're able to offer marketing and operations leaders an enterprise solution that their teams will actually enjoy using — one that prioritizes power, flexibility, and usability, and makes it easy for their best people to do their best work. We've seen rapidly scaling organizations like Travelopia, Trello, and Adaptive Insights do incredible things with Marketing Hub Enterprise, and I'm excited to see what our other customers can achieve with the new features we're launching today."Sophisticated Marketing Made EasyNow available in Marketing Hub Enterprise are revenue attribution reporting, AI-powered A/B testing, partitioning, and account-based marketing tools.

Increased limits on workflows, lists, and more, giving HubSpot users more room to grow."Trello is the visual project management tool for teams who want to get work done without unnecessary complexities," said Leah Ryder, Brand & Content Marketing Lead at Trello. "We love how easy HubSpot makes it for our marketing team to deliver relevant content to our users and get reliable insights into what's resonating. When we first started using Marketing Hub Enterprise, we were pleased by how straightforward the tools were to use — particularly SEO planning and the ability to track CTAs across multiple languages in our global campaigns. We're delighted to see HubSpot continuing to add powerful new capabilities that will help Trello continue to grow towards our 100 million user goal in 2020 and beyond.""monday.com is the work operating system of choice by more than 100,000 organizations worldwide," said Oren Ezra, Head of Enterprise Marketing at monday.com.
