Instead, Target will do what it does best — utilize its best in class private label supply chain and try to make a splash on its own.Later this month Target will debut a new athleticwear brand dubbed All in Motion. It’s a private label collection that spans T-shirts, tank tops, polo shirts, pants, leggings, sports bras, swimwear, yoga mats and hand weights. Prices for the tops, shorts and leggings are typical Target, ranging from $3.99 to $69.99.No footwear, yet.One could expect Target to hype up the attributes of the clothing in stores and online — Target says the apparel features technology (see stretch materials) comparable to premium activewear brands. The company also noted the majority of the products boast sustainably sourced materials (memo to disposable fashion king Zara — this can be done).Target believes All in Motion could be a billion dollar sales brand in the first year of availability.“It’s an important category for us,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said of activewear in an interview with Yahoo Finance last month. Cornell added he thought the brand would “delight” Target shoppers.Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell speaks to a group of investors, Wednesday, March 2, 2016, in New York.

Similar to Target’s other private label brands, All in Motion hopes to offer more attractive profit margins than a national brand product. That’s a positive for Target’s future earnings.The only wildcard here is how All in Motion will manage to wrestle business away from Nike, Adidas and Under Armour. All three powerhouse brands have introduced cheaper versions of their products at department stores, online and even at outlet locations.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
