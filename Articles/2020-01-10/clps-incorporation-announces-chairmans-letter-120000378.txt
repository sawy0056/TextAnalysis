All CLPS shareholders are encouraged to read it.Dear Shareholders,On behalf of the Board, I wish you a happy new year!In 2019, global demand for financial IT services and solutions was fueled by growth in the fintech industry and advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence, blockchain, big data, and cloud applications. At the same time, there is still a shortage of professional IT talent in the above-mentioned areas.We believe that such demand will continue to gain momentum in 2020. In response, CLPS continues to invest in resources, improve our performance, and drive technological and management innovation to achieve high quality development. With our comprehensive understanding of market needs in financial IT services and solutions in China and globally, we are committed to the strategy of continuously expanding into the international market, providing more clients with the professional IT services that CLPS has to offer. As a result, it enables us to further expand our market share, improve our brand influence, and achieve significant growth.Let us look back at the highlights of the Company's performance in 2019 and our plans for 2020.1. Client Base and Revenue GrowthCLPS has expanded its overseas and domestic client base in the financial services and IT industries, which covers global credit cards, banking, data analysis, business intelligence, and decision-making, among others.

Gross profit increased by $6.1 million, or 34.5%, to $23.8 million for the fiscal year 2019, from $17.7 million in the prior year period.2. IT InnovationWe are dedicated to the research and applications of innovative technologies, including distributed application systems, cloud computing, micro services, open API, robotic process automation (RPA), blockchain, and big data. In the past year, we have applied RPA and big data technology to our internal human resources management and financial management systems, which significantly improved our operational efficiency. In addition, we deployed RPA to our clients, and we have received positive feedback on our technology. In 2020, we intend to apply more innovative technologies to our internal management systems to further reduce operational costs. The learnings derived from our internal implementations will then enable us to offer the technologies to our clients. In addition, we aim to optimize our capability in credit card services. Through our efforts, we will be able to improve our IT services efficiency, achieve client satisfaction, and attain high quality performance growth.3. Management ExcellenceWe continue to optimize our internal enterprise resource planning (ERP) management system to provide timely and effective data for management decisions.

We are also committed to our partnerships with universities including Shanghai Sanda University, the Shanghai Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Jian Qiao University. With our partners, we aim to further develop new financial IT talent by including financial IT courses in university curriculums and by deploying our CLPS Virtual Bank Training Platform. In 2020, we will continue to improve the function and efficiency of our ERP management system, develop more financial IT talent, enable more staff to receive technical and management training, and support the Company to achieve greater heights.4.
