(EKG.V)(EKGGF)("CardioComm" or the "Company"), a global provider of consumer heart monitoring and electrocardiogram ("ECG") device and software solutions, is pleased to confirm it has entered into a partnership agreement with CareOS SAS (France), a subsidiary of Baracoda Group ("CareOS"), to provide consumer ECG monitoring technologies through the CareOS Poseidon smart mirror health and beauty hub.The partnership will see CardioComm's FDA and Health Canada cleared GEMS™ ECG management software and Smart Monitoring ECG reading service integrated into the touch and gesture controlled smart mirror. The GEMSTM software will be capable of recognizing ECG devices made by multiple device manufacturers which will permit CareOS customers more options in choosing a device of their preference. The HeartCheck™ CardiBeat will be a CareOS recommended device given its availability in Canada, the US and Europe. When taking an ECG, the user will activate the smart mirror's display to connect to a selected ECG device. The Smart mirror will also display the ECG trace in real-time during the recording. Once recorded the ECG can be replayed and there will be no limit to the number of ECG reports the user can generate. Users will also have the option to send any of the recorded ECGs to CardioComm's SMART Monitoring ECG reading service to have the ECG reviewed and a triage ECG report provided.CareOS' interest to integrate CardioComm's easy-to-use ECG monitoring technologies into the Poseidon smart mirror compliments both companies' objectives to produce a credible, privacy-first, intuitive personal care platform that improves wellbeing and long term health. The innovative Poseidon smart mirror was also awarded the Consumer Electronics Show ("CES") Innovation Award in the Smart Home category for a second consecutive year.CardioComm was the first company to enter the personalized ECG monitoring market and it did so to address an unmet availability of medically credible heart monitoring solutions to the consumer market. The Company is motivated to develop partnerships with innovative organizations like CareOS, to assist in bringing new "firsts" to market that can leverage medically credentialed technologies that physicians are already familiar with and that will enhance the consumer's health monitoring experience.CardioComm is listed as a partner on the CareOS website and the Company will also be present at CES.To learn more about CardioComm's products and for further updates regarding HeartCheck™ ECG device integrations please visit the Company's websites at www.cardiocommsolutions.com and www.theheartcheck.com.About CardioComm SolutionsCardioComm Solutions' patented and proprietary technology is used in products for recording, viewing, analyzing and storing electrocardiograms for diagnosis and management of cardiac patients.
