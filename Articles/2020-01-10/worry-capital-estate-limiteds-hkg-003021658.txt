This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. After that, we will consider the growth in the business. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. View our latest analysis for Capital Estate How Does Stephen Chu's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, Capital Estate Limited has a market capitalization of HK$163m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth HK$2.6m over the year to July 2019. That's below the compensation, last year. It is worth noting that the CEO compensation consists almost entirely of the salary, worth HK$2.6m. We examined a group of similar sized companies, with market capitalizations of below HK$1.6b. The median CEO total compensation in that group is HK$1.8m.Thus we can conclude that Stephen Chu receives more in total compensation than the median of a group of companies in the same market, and of similar size to Capital Estate Limited. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the pay is too high. We can get a better idea of how generous the pay is by looking at the performance of the underlying business.The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at Capital Estate has changed from year to year.SEHK:193 CEO Compensation, January 9th 2020MoreIs Capital Estate Limited Growing?On average over the last three years, Capital Estate Limited has grown earnings per share (EPS) by 95% each year (using a line of best fit).

Our data suggests that it pays above the median CEO pay within that group.However, the earnings per share growth over three years is certainly impressive.
