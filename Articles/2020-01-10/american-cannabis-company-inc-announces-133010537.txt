Announces The Appointment Of Mr. David M. Godfrey To The Position Of Chief Financial OfficerGlobeNewswireJanuary 9, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareDENVER, CO, Jan. 09, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- American Cannabis Company, Inc. (AMMJ) (“ACC”), a full-service business-to-business cannabis and hemp consulting solutions provider, is pleased to announce the promotion and appointment of David Michael Godfrey as its new Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Godfrey brings over 40 years of experience to the leadership team, and his career has primarily focused on multiple state and multiple unit large scale restaurant chains, retail apparel and healthcare centers. Notably, Mr. Godfrey has developed systematic financial reporting standards for multi-brand restaurants across the country. With ACC’s expansion efforts to become a nationally recognized cannabis brand, such experience and tenure will serve as support to a methodical approach in acquisitions and the pursuit of operator’s licenses.Prior to his employment with ACC, Mr. Godfrey supervised the financials, reporting and infrastructure for 130+ restaurants throughout the United States, Mexico, Dubai, Japan and Germany. Having worked in the healthcare industry as a Director of Corporate Financial Planning, he also helped to develop the financial reporting standards for a multi-specialist physician practice while at the same time effectively downsizing an overgrown multi-entity organization. This international experience coupled with Mr. Godfrey’s deep understanding of financial planning, strategic planning, development, and contract negotiations will furthermore support American Cannabis Company in its plan to grow steadily and sustain as a long-term, well-known brand name.Terry Buffalo, American Cannabis Company’s Principal Executive Officer, commented: “ACC is proud to announce the appointment of David Godfrey from VP of Finance to CFO. David started with us in September as VP of Finance, and in this short time he has demonstrated his skills and abilities having already improved upon our internal accounting processes and implementing more robust inventory tracking solutions. In addition to his current roles and responsibilities, Mr. Godfrey will help to identify and vet potential acquisition opportunities. With his diverse background he will be a valuable resource as we execute our planned national expansion.”David Godfrey, CFO for American Cannabis Company, stated: “This is a unique time in the cannabis industry where the pioneers have forged the beginnings of the industry, thus providing multiple opportunities for consolidation, mergers and acquisitions to bring efficiencies and productivity to multiple units in markets throughout the US and Canada. With IRS regulations still in place such as 280E, these opportunities bring about unique management issues in reporting and managing on a day-to-day and month-to-month basis. Coming from a tight margin industry, I feel the opportunity is right for ACC to further expand its strategic planning to be a fully-integrated cannabis company from soil to oil.”About American Cannabis Company, Inc.American Cannabis Company, Inc. offers end-to-end solutions to existing and aspiring participants in the cannabis and hemp industries.
