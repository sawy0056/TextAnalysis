Looking back over the last year, the stock has been a solid performer, with a gain of 14%.All else being equal, a share price drop should make a stock more attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. The implication here is that long term investors have an opportunity when expectations of a company are too low. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. View our latest analysis for Ginger Beef Does Ginger Beef Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 10.62 that sentiment around Ginger Beef isn't particularly high. The image below shows that Ginger Beef has a lower P/E than the average (20.0) P/E for companies in the food industry.TSXV:GB Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 9th 2020MoreGinger Beef's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with Ginger Beef, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.Ginger Beef shrunk earnings per share by 61% over the last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 90%. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 17% per year over the last three years. This could justify a low P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does Ginger Beef's Balance Sheet Tell Us?With net cash of CA$686k, Ginger Beef has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 41% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On Ginger Beef's P/E RatioGinger Beef trades on a P/E ratio of 10.6, which is below the CA market average of 15.7. The recent drop in earnings per share would make investors cautious, the relatively strong balance sheet will allow the company time to invest in growth. If it achieves that, then there's real potential that the low P/E could eventually indicate undervaluation. Given Ginger Beef's P/E ratio has declined from 16.1 to 10.6 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is significantly less confident about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
