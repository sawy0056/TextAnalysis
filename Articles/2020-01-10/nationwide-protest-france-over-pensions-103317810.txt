The Elysee presidential palace was barricaded as protesters were due to head toward the area.Unions said the protest in the capital attracted 370,000 demonstrators, while French consulting firm Occurrence estimated a crowd of 44,000.By the time the demonstration winded down, 20 demonstrators and 16 police officers had been injured, according to the Paris police department.

Regional trains were also affected. and many schools were closed.Unions have also called on workers to block road access to major ports, including in the southern city of Marseille.Philippe Martinez, head of hard-left CGT union, said "there are many people on strike” yet the government doesn't appear “willing to discuss and take into account the opinion of unions.”Talks between the government and labor unions resumed Tuesday but no compromise has been found.

Macron has asked his government to find a quick compromise with reform-minded unions.So far, the government is sticking to its plan to raise the full retirement age from 62 to 64, the most criticized part of the proposals.The changes aim to unify France’s 42 different pension schemes into a single one.
