We look forward to advancing ACE1702 into its first clinical trial.”  About ACE1702ACE1702 is Acepodia’s lead clinical product candidate developed from the Company’s proprietary ACC™ platform. It targets human HER2-expressing solid tumors using anti-HER2 antibody conjugated oNK cells. ACE1702 has demonstrated enhanced tumor cell killing activities both in vitro and in vivo, while maintaining a favorable safety profile in GLP toxicology studies. In preclinical studies, ACE1702 has shown enhanced tumor-killing activities against HER2 IHC 1+, 2+ and 3+ human cancer cells.  About Acepodia Acepodia is a privately held US-Taiwan biotechnology company committed to developing safe, effective, and affordable immunotherapeutic medicines targeting diseases with significant unmet medical needs, with a primary focus on oncology. Acepodia’s proprietary ACC™ (Antibody Cell-Conjugation) technology platform links tumor targeting antibodies to the surface of a novel and proprietary human NK cell line that have been specifically selected for their potent antitumor activity. The ACC technology can be seamlessly combined with currently available antibodies allowing for the rapid development of new targeted therapies in multiple indications, without the need for genetic engineering.Investor ContactSpike LoAcepodia886 (2) 2697-6100spike@acepodiabio.com
