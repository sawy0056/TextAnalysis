(OSI.V) (RSR1.F) ("Osino” or “the Company”), is pleased to announce the receipt of assays for a further 16 holes at its Twin Hills Central discovery (“THC”), including high grades over significant widths contained in structurally controlled shoots.Significant intersections include 92m @ 1.40g/t (OKD024) and 37m @ 2.58g/t (OKD022). The latest results increase the strike length of gold mineralization by 50% to 1200m (open both east and west and at depth). The Company is anticipating receipt of additional results from 2 holes at THC as well as 14 holes at Twin Hills West, Clouds and Barking Dog. Previous results were reported in news releases dated September 26 and November 14, 2019.David Underwood, Osino’s VP Exploration commented: “These new drill results at Twin Hills Central expand the gold mineralization to a strike length of 1200m so far and include our best intersection yet of 92m @ 1.40g/t in hole OKD024. This exceptional intersection is situated at the south west end of the THC drill coverage, approximately 1000m from another exceptional new assay result in OKD022, demonstrating the continuity, scale and economic potential of the growing Twin Hills gold system. We are excited about the prospect of extending the various new high-grade shoots and wide zones of gold mineralization further to the east, south and west in the next drill program. Once we have received the assays from the remaining two drill holes the next steps include updating the geological, structural and mineralization models for THC and planning for the next round of drilling”. Heye Daun, Osino’s CEO commented further: “To put the results of our Twin Hills drill program to date into perspective, we compared the assay results from our initial 31 drill holes with the first 31 exploration holes drilled at B2 Gold’s Otjikoto Gold Project after discovery, between 1999 and 2004. This analysis is based on Osino’s own Twin Hills assay results to date, and the reported borehole intercepts as contained in the Independent Technical Report on the Otjikoto Gold Project, by SRK Consulting in August 2009. Based on this analysis, Twin Hills’ average gold mineralization intercept multiplied by the average unconstrained borehole grade is 51 Gram-Meters (using the commonly used shorthand method of multiplying intersection width with grade). This is about 50% more than Otjikoto’s average intersection width multiplied by average borehole gold grade of 33 Gram-Meters for the initial 31 holes drilled at Otjikoto. What this demonstrates is that the early exploration success at Twin Hills is indeed similar and arguably better than the early exploration success at Otjikoto. It took the previous owners of Otjikoto 4 years from initial discovery in 1999 until the completion of the initial 50 RC & diamond exploration holes, and another 2 years until September 2005 to declare the maiden inferred Otjikoto gold resource of 871,795 ounces at 1.06 g/t, based on drill coverage of 100 x 50m. Since June 2019 Osino has already drilled 33 holes at Twin Hills Central for coverage of about 200 x 100m and we are going to move to 100 x 50m drill spacing later in 2020 in anticipation of a maiden resource at Twin Hills Central. Twin Hills is proving to be a large mineralized system with the strike length, thickness and gold grades which hold the promise of rapid conversion and bulking up of resource ounces as the next phase of drilling at Twin Hills Central advances to the resource definition stage.” Assay Results for Twin Hills Central DrillingAssays have been received to date for a total of 16 reverse circulation (RC) and 8 diamond (DD) holes from the Phase 2 drill program at Twin Hills Central which ended in early December 2019 – see Figure 1. The Phase 2 program included step out and in-fill drilling to follow-up the successful Phase 1 program reported on September 26, 2019 which consisted of 7 DD holes. All holes at THC were drilled at an azimuth of 160 degrees (SSE) with the exception of OKD022 which was drilled in the opposite direction (340 degrees) in order to check down dip continuity. Significant intersections for the Phase 1 and 2 programs are presented in Table 1.Story continuesA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/35570b83-ed83-405f-a1cc-6b5fc776047dIn the diagram above, borehole collars have been color-coded according to a commonly used shorthand method of ranking gold intercepts: Multiplying intercept average grade (g/t) by width (meters) resulting in a “g/t x meter” intercept measure (combining both average gold grade and intercept width into a single metric known as “Gram-Meter”). On this basis, Osino considers any intercept of more than 50 as very good and any intercept of more than 100 as exceptional.Using this metric, Osino has a total of 9 exceptional and very good intercepts out of 31 holes drilled so far (since June 2018), compared with Otjikoto’s 7 exceptional and very good intercepts achieved out of the initial 31 boreholes drilled between 1999 and 2004.Twin Hills Central remains open along strike towards the east and west, and down dip at depth below 200m.The next phase of drilling at Twin Hills Central will focus on closing off the mineralization towards the south, following the emerging high-grade shoots towards the south west and east as well as ongoing infill drilling.Initial results for Twin Hills West, Clouds and Barking Dog will be reported once the balance of assays have been received. The next phase of drilling at these targets will be planned to follow up all significant assay results.  Following receipt and interpretation of all remaining assay results, Osino will compile and announce the expected 2020 work program. This is expected to be published in January/February 2020, with the next round of drilling to commence late Q1 2019.Table 1: Summary of All Drill Intercepts from Phase 1 and 2 Drilling at Twin Hills Central Hole ID From (m) To (m) Width (m) Au (g/t) X UTM 33S Y UTM 33S

True widths are unknown at this stage. Included intercepts are at 0.4g/t cut-off, minimum 2m wide and no more that 2m internal dilution.Geology and StructureThe Twin Hills Project lies within the Kuiseb Formation, a sequence of turbiditic marine sediments several kilometers thick, which was folded during the Damaran orogen. The gold mineralization at Twin Hills Central is hosted by a meta-greywacke unit which has been tightly folded into an overturned syncline. The mineralization is contained within the southern limb of the syncline in millimeter to centimeter scale quartz-sulphide veins, which are parallel to the steeply NNW dipping foliation.The meta-greywacke unit is underlain by biotite schist and cordierite schist. Sulphide minerals include pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and pyrite in veinlets and as disseminated alteration. Geochemical data indicates a strong correlation between gold and arsenopyrite within the meta-greywacke unit.The assay results to date clearly indicate the presence of structurally controlled high-grade shoots within the larger mineralized halo. The process of modelling geology, structure and grade in 3-D has now commenced prior to the planning of the next drill program.Qualified PersonDavid Underwood, BSc.
