Currently, the pair is trading at 1.3107, up 0.01% on the day.Pound Steady after Iran Strikes BackThe U.S. strike which killed an Iranian general triggered some volatility from the pound at the start of the week, but the currency has settled down, as GBP/USD trades just above the 1.31 line. After Iran retaliated by launching missiles at two U.S. bases in Iraq, there are hopes that the crisis will now de-escalate. Still, the situation in the Persian Gulf remains tense, and traders should act with caution as the currency markets remain unsettled. A sudden flare-up in the region could spook investors and trigger further volatility in the markets.Lawmakers Debate Brexit BillOvershadowed by the U.S-Iran crisis, British lawmakers have begun debate over the Brexit bill. The bill is expected to easily pass through parliament, as Prime Minister Johnson has a comfortable majority in parliament. However, there are dark clouds just around the corner. Brexit is scheduled for January 31st, followed by a transition period until the end of 2020. Johnson wants to wrap up a trade agreement with the EU by then, but the Europeans have warned that the timetable is far too short to reach a comprehensive agreement. If the sides are unable to agree on a timetable, tensions could rise and nervous investors could lose confidence in the pound.Technical AnalysisThe 1.3150 line is an immediate resistance line. Above, we find resistance at 1.3220, followed by the round number of 1.3300. On the downside, there is support at 1.3050. The next support level is at 1.30, which has psychological significance.GBP/USD 1-Day ChartMore Pacific Currencies – Daily SummaryUSD/CNYThe Chinese yuan is flexing some muscle, as USD/CNY continues to move lower.
