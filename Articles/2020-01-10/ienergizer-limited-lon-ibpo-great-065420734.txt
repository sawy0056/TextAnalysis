Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.In this case, iEnergizer likely looks attractive to dividend investors, given its 3.7% dividend yield and seven-year payment history. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on iEnergizer! AIM:IBPO Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, iEnergizer paid out 71% of its profit as dividends. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. iEnergizer paid out 51% of its cash flow as dividends last year, which is within a reasonable range for the average corporation. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Consider getting
our latest analysis on iEnergizer's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Looking at the data, we can see that iEnergizer has been paying a dividend for the past seven years. It's good to see that iEnergizer has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. During the past seven-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.13 in 2013, compared to US$0.13 last year. The dividend has shrunk at a rate of less than 1% a year over this period.When a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. iEnergizer has grown its earnings per share at 8.7% per annum over the past five years. The rate at which earnings have grown is quite decent, and by paying out more than half of its earnings as dividends, the company is striking a reasonable balance between reinvestment and returns to shareholders.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. iEnergizer's is paying out more than half its income as dividends, but at least the dividend is covered by both reported earnings and cashflow. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Ultimately, iEnergizer comes up short on our dividend analysis. It's not that we think it is a bad company - just that there are likely more appealing dividend prospects out there on this analysis.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in iEnergizer stock.
