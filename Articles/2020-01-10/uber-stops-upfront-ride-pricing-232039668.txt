That service fee previously fluctuated.Uber on Wednesday also told customers it discontinued some of its reward benefits for frequent riders.The company hopes the changes will bolster its argument that Uber is merely a technology platform connecting riders with drivers, not a transportation company.The California law strikes at the heart of the "gig economy" business model by making it harder for companies to qualify their workers as contractors rather than employees. The measure went into effect on Jan 1.By classifying contractors as employees, technology companies like Uber, Lyft Inc, DoorDash and Postmates Inc would be subject to labor laws that require higher pay and other benefits, such as medical insurance.Uber and Postmates, a courier services provider, in a lawsuit in late December asked a U.S. court to block the law.Uber has repeatedly said that its drivers are properly classified as contractors.Nevertheless, the company has made changes to its driver app in recent weeks, with California drivers now being able to see more information ahead of accepting a trip, including the ride's likely fare, length and destination.(Reporting by Tina Bellon in New YorkEditing by Bill Berkrot)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBradley's career night lifts Cal past No. 21 Colorado 76-62The Associated PressUS patient with coronavirus of unknown origin denied test for daysAFPKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergCalifornia at heart of battle to choose Trump's opponentAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
