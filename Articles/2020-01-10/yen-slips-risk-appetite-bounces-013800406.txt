The sanctions would remain in force until Iran changes its behavior, he added.The decision from the president to opt for sanctions rather than military response sent safe-haven assets down, while stocks and other risk assets recovered.The USD/JPY pair was up 0.1% to 109.26.The GBP/USD pair gained 0.2% to 1.3119.
