Mild weather and a glut of new supply has held back gas, even as U.S. exports of super-cooled liquefied natural gas have soared.On an energy equivalent basis, oil should trade about six times over gas.Spot gas prices at the U.S. Henry Hub <NG-W-HH-SNL> benchmark in Louisiana fell 19% to average $2.56 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2019. Analysts project that average will fall to around $2.31 in 2020, which would be its lowest since 1999.Speculators have boosted short positions in futures and options on the New York Mercantile Exchange <3023651MSHT> to the highest since November 2015, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.(Graphic: U.S. gas speculators' shorts https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ENERGY-NATGAS-OIL-RATIO/0H001QXTDB7Z/index.html)The increase in shorts comes as record production allowed utilities to boost the amount of gas in storage to near normal levels ahead of the coming heating season.Gas production rose about 10% in 2019 to a record 92.05 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Analysts expect the pace of that growth to fall as energy firms cut spending, but EIA still expects output will rise about 3% in 2020.(Graphic: U.S. gas output https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-LNG-RECORD/0H001QXRNB2T/index.html)(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat Does TL Natural Gas Holdings Limited’s (HKG:8536) 14% ROCE Say About The Business?Simply Wall St.Energy junk-bonds tumble as coronavirus fears drag oil, natural gas lowerMarketWatchTellurian stock falls after company extends U.S. LNG sale negotiations with PetronetReutersNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble Following Inventory Draw MissFX EmpireCrude Oil Price Forecast – Crude Oil Markets Continue To Fall ApartFX EmpireBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
