The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.China Foods maintained roughly steady earnings over the last twelve months. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 13% per year over the last three years. This growth rate might warrant a low P/E ratio. So you wouldn't expect a very high P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does China Foods's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?China Foods has net debt worth just 7.6% of its market capitalization. The market might award it a higher P/E ratio if it had net cash, but its unlikely this low level of net borrowing is having a big impact on the P/E multiple.The Verdict On China Foods's P/E RatioChina Foods trades on a P/E ratio of 20.8, which is above its market average of 10.5.
