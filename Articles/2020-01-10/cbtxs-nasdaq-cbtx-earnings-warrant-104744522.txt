And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like CBTX (NASDAQ:CBTX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. Check out our latest analysis for CBTX How Fast Is CBTX Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price will eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that CBTX has managed to grow EPS by 20% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of CBTX's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. CBTX maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 12% to US$148m. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So check CBTX's balance sheet strength, before getting too excited.Are CBTX Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Like standing at the lookout, surveying the horizon at sunrise, insider buying, for some investors, sparks joy. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.The first bit of good news is that no CBTX insiders reported share sales in the last twelve months. Even better, though, is that the Independent Director, Joe Penland, bought a whopping US$275k worth of shares, paying about US$28.42 per share, on average. Big buys like that give me a sense of opportunity; actions speak louder than words.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for CBTX bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. Notably, they have an enormous stake in the company, worth US$163m. That equates to 21% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. So it might be my imagination, but I do sense the glimmer of an opportunity.While insiders are apparently happy to hold and accumulate shares, that is just part of the pretty picture. The cherry on top is that the CEO, Bob Franklin is paid comparatively modestly to CEOs at similar sized companies. For companies with market capitalizations between US$400m and US$1.6b, like CBTX, the median CEO pay is around US$2.6m.Story continuesThe CBTX CEO received US$1.6m in compensation for the year ending December 2018. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies, and seems pretty reasonable to me. While the level of CEO compensation isn't a huge factor in my view of the company, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is CBTX Worth Keeping An Eye On?Given my belief that share price follows earnings per share you can easily imagine how I feel about CBTX's strong EPS growth. Better still, insiders own a large chunk of the company and one has even been buying more shares. So it's fair to say I think this stock may well deserve a spot on your watchlist. Of course, just because CBTX is growing does not mean it is undervalued.
