On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.A high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Ocean Wilsons Holdings. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Ocean Wilsons Holdings! LSE:OCN Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 79% of Ocean Wilsons Holdings's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Ocean Wilsons Holdings paid out 102% of its free cash flow last year, which we think is concerning if cash flows do not improve. While Ocean Wilsons Holdings's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, free cash flow is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to Ocean Wilsons Holdings's ability to maintain its dividend.With a strong net cash balance, Ocean Wilsons Holdings investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Ocean Wilsons Holdings's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Ocean Wilsons Holdings has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.30 in 2010, compared to US$0.70 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.8% a year over that time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.Story continuesDividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. In the last five years, Ocean Wilsons Holdings's earnings per share have shrunk at approximately 3.7% per annum. A modest decline in earnings per share is not great to see, but it doesn't automatically make a dividend unsustainable. Still, we'd vastly prefer to see EPS growth when researching dividend stocks.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Ocean Wilsons Holdings's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we think Ocean Wilsons Holdings has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. Earnings per share are down, and Ocean Wilsons Holdings's dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. There are a few too many issues for us to get comfortable with Ocean Wilsons Holdings from a dividend perspective. Businesses can change, but we would struggle to identify why an investor should rely on this stock for their income.Are management backing themselves to deliver performance?
