With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand TOMO Holdings Limited (HKG:6928).Over the last twelve months TOMO Holdings has recorded a ROE of 12%. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each HK$1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made HK$0.12 in profit. See our latest analysis for TOMO Holdings How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for TOMO Holdings:12% = S$2.9m ÷ S$24m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does ROE Mean?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does TOMO Holdings Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that TOMO Holdings has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Auto Components industry (12%).SEHK:6928 Past Revenue and Net Income, January 9th 2020MoreThat's not overly surprising. ROE doesn't tell us if the share price is low, but it can inform us to the nature of the business. For those looking for a bargain, other factors may be more important. I will like TOMO Holdings better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining TOMO Holdings's Debt And Its 12% Return On EquityTOMO Holdings is free of net debt, which is a positive for shareholders. Its respectable ROE suggests it is a business worth watching, but it's even better the company achieved this without leverage. After all, when a company has a strong balance sheet, it can often find ways to invest in growth, even if it takes some time.But It's Just One MetricReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
