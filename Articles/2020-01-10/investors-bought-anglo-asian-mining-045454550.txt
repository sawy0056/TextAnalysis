View our latest analysis for Anglo Asian Mining In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years of share price growth, Anglo Asian Mining moved from a loss to profitability.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Anglo Asian Mining the TSR over the last 5 years was 2589%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Anglo Asian Mining shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 80% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, that falls short of the 93% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years.
