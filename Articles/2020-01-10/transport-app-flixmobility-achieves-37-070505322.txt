It is now present in 30 countries.FlixMobility launched coach services in the United States in 2018, challenging the veteran Greyhound brand, and now serves 100 destinations from coast to coast.PLATFORM PLAYFlixMobility's backers include Holtzbrinck Ventures, the European Investment Bank, General Atlantic, Silver Lake and German carmaker Daimler.Daimler has also teamed up in a mobility venture with BMW, called FREE NOW, that offers a range of services ranging from taxis and ride hailing to car sharing. The FREE NOW platform achieved turnover of 2 billion euros last year.Although FlixMobility does not report financials, Engert told Reuters last year that it was profitable in its mature markets, making it possible to break even overall as it expanded into new territories.It has identified India as a potential target market and started recruiting there, a company spokesman said, but no decisions have yet been taken to launch in the country of 1.3 billion people.The company is expanding its FlixTrain service in Germany and plans to launch rail operations in Sweden this year, the company said in a statement.Car pooling platform FlixCar went live in France at the end of 2019 - taking on local startup BlaBlaCar, with more launches to follow.($1 = 0.8987 euros)(Reporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextRomania's president asks finance minister Citu to form governmentReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
