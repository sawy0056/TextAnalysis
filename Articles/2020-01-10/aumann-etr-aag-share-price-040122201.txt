But in truth the last year hasn't been good for the share price. In fact the stock is down 50% in the last year, well below the market return. View our latest analysis for Aumann There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unhappily, Aumann had to report a 28% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price decline of 50% is actually more than the EPS drop. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, a year ago.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).XTRA:AAG Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.A Different PerspectiveGiven that the market gained 19% in the last year, Aumann shareholders might be miffed that they lost 49% (even including dividends) . While the aim is to do better than that, it's worth recalling that even great long-term investments sometimes underperform for a year or more. It's great to see a nice little 35% rebound in the last three months. This could just be a bounce because the selling was too aggressive, but fingers crossed it's the start of a new trend.
