(NYSE: AZZ), a global provider of metal coatings services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services, today announced financial results for the three- and nine-month periods ended November 30, 2019.AZZ Inc. is a global provider of metal coatings services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services. (PRNewsfoto/AZZ Inc.)MoreManagement DiscussionTom Ferguson, president and chief executive officer of AZZ Inc., commented, "Third quarter fiscal year 2020 financial results were driven by strength in both our Energy and Metal Coatings segments with consolidated revenue increasing 21.6% to $291.1 million and net income increasing 43.1% to $22.0 million, as compared to the third quarter last year."Metal Coatings segment revenue increased 20.2% from the third quarter of last year driven by organic volume growth and strategic acquisitions. Operating margins were 21.1%, compared to 17.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, driven by lower zinc costs flowing through our kettles, offset somewhat by the costs associated with ramping up our Surface Technologies and Continuous Galvanized Rebar businesses," stated Mr. Ferguson. "We are confident that our Digital Galvanizing System ("DGS") initiative will allow us to realize greater operational efficiency and productivity. We anticipate the uptick in the costs associated with growing the Surface Technologies and Continuous Galvanized Rebar businesses to be temporary. AZZ remains the industry leader in North America with 41 galvanizing plants and continues to pursue growth through organic and inorganic channels."As we previously indicated our Energy Segment experienced a particularly strong fall turnaround season in North America, driving 22.7% revenue growth with 10.8% operating margins. The Welding Solutions group had a strong third quarter, executing at a very high level during a very active fall turnaround season. Our industrial served markets improved compared to prior year, and we are especially pleased with the demand for specialty welding, both domestically and internationally.Overall, consolidated bookings – in both the Energy and Metal Coatings segments – were up 24.8% for the quarter, growing to $263.7 million compared to $211.3 million in the third quarter last year. We are focused on delivering organic growth and driving operational efficiencies in both segments to improve future sales. We expect to complete fiscal 2020 on a strong note with that momentum carrying into fiscal 2021." Mr. Ferguson concluded, "We are reaffirming our previously issued guidance for fiscal 2020 with earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90 per diluted share, and revenues to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.06 billion. Our fiscal year 2020 guidance reflects our estimates given the current market conditions, current backlog expectations, and does not include any significant acquisitions or divestitures."Third Quarter ResultsRevenues for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $291.1 million compared to $239.5 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 21.6%. Net income for the third quarter increased 43.1% to $22.0 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared to $15.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.Story continuesGross margins for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 were 23.1% compared to 20.8% in the third quarter of last year.  Operating margins were 11.5% compared to 9.5% the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 despite SG&A as a percentage of sales rising slightly to 11.6% of sales compared to 11.3% of sales in the prior year. Additionally, the effective tax rate increased to 28.6% in the current quarter compared to 17.8% in the third quarter of the prior year, with the change primarily attributable to 2019 tax return to provision adjustments that were recorded during the quarter.Incoming orders for the quarter were $263.7 million resulting in a book to revenue ratio of 0.91.  In the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 incoming orders were $211.3 million, resulting in a book to revenue ratio of 0.88. Our backlog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 fell 10.8% to $274.5 million compared to $307.8 million for the third quarter of last year. Approximately 36% of the current backlog is expected to be delivered outside the U.S., compared to 54% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.Metal Coatings SegmentRevenues for the Metal Coatings segment for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $129.2 million, compared to the $107.5 million for the same period last year, an increase of 20.2%. Gross profit grew 46.0% to $31.6 million from $21.7 million in the same quarter last year, driving gross margins of 24.5% compared to 20.2% in the same quarter last year.  Operating income increased 48.8% to $27.3 million as compared to $18.3 million in the third quarter last year.
