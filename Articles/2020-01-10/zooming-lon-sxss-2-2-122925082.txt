How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.A slim 2.2% yield is hard to get excited about, but the long payment history is respectable. At the right price, or with strong growth opportunities, Spectris could have potential. The company also bought back stock during the year, equivalent to approximately 2.3% of the company's market capitalisation at the time. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Spectris for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis LSE:SXS Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 151% of Spectris's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, from the perspective of an investor who hopes to own the company for many years, a payout ratio of above 100% is definitely a concern.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. The company paid out 73% of its free cash flow, which is not bad per se, but does start to limit the amount of cash Spectris has available to meet other needs. It's good to see that while Spectris's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Extraordinarily few companies are capable of persistently paying a dividend that is greater than their profits.Is Spectris's Balance Sheet Risky?As Spectris's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 1.79 times its EBITDA, Spectris has an acceptable level of debt.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Spectris has interest cover of more than 12 times its interest expense, which we think is quite strong.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Spectris's latest financial position,

For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Spectris's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was UK£0.23 in 2010, compared to UK£0.61 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 10% per year over this time.Story continuesWith rapid dividend growth and no notable cuts to the dividend over a lengthy period of time, we think this company has a lot going for it.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Spectris's earnings per share have shrunk at 25% a year over the past five years. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and Spectris's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Spectris's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. We're a bit uncomfortable with its high payout ratio, although at least the dividend was covered by free cash flow. Moreover, earnings have been shrinking. While the dividends have been fairly steady, we'd wonder for how much longer this will be sustainable if earnings continue to decline. In summary, Spectris has a number of shortcomings that we'd find it hard to get past. Things could change, but we think there are likely more attractive alternatives out there.Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from costs or inflation. Very few businesses see earnings consistently shrink year after year in perpetuity though, and so it might be worth seeing what the 14 analysts we track are forecasting for the future.We have also put together a list of global stocks with a market capitalisation above $1bn and yielding more 3%.
