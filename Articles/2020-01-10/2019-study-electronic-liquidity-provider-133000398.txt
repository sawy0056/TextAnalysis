Future prospects for the market are also considered.The implementation of MiFID II in 2018 introduced significant change on Europe's equity venue landscape, with one of the most intriguing developments being the emergence of systematic internalisers (SIs) run by electronic liquidity providers (ELPs).The growth of ELP SIs is arguably representative of the broader shift of order flow origination from traditional banks to electronic market-makers.The notion of ELPs being able to provide liquidity directly to clients would have been unlikely just a few years ago given levels of buy-side anxiety around such firms. However, the SI regime offers the buy-side a unique opportunity to analyse liquidity from each ELP and use them more or less accordingly.Key Topics CoveredIntroduction SI Regime Recap The Role of Brokers and ELP SIs ELP SI Rules of Engagement ELP SI Volume Summary Understanding ELP SIs Overview Stock Universes Order Sizes Future Outlook for ELP SIs Regulatory Changes Operational Changes Competitive Landscape ConclusionCompanies Mentioned Citadel Securities Hudson River Trading IMC Trading Jane Street Jump Trading SSW Market-Making Tower Research Capital Virtu Financial XTX MarketsFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/vycwkaResearch and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Research and Markets Laura Wood, Senior Manager press@researchandmarkets.com    For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907 Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716CisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2019-study-of-electronic-liquidity-provider-elp-systematic-internalisers-sis-rules-of-engagement-volume-summary-understanding-liquidity-competitive-landscape-future-outlook-300984304.htmlSOURCE Research and MarketsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
