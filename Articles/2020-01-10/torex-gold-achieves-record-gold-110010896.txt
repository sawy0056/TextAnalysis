The operational performance allowed us to achieve record annual gold production of over 450,000 ounces, placing us towards the upper end of the guided range. The entire team is proud of the operational and financial performance delivered in 2019.“We look forward to another solid year in 2020 as we seek to replicate a similar production result, advance Media Luna towards construction, prove up the potential of Muckahi, extend higher grade mineralization at Sub-Sill and ELD, and continue to strengthen the balance sheet.”Jody Kuzenko, COO of Torex, added:“I am extremely pleased with the way our operations team performed throughout the year. We overcame several challenges at the start of the year, rebounding quickly to deliver the highest three quarters of production to date out of El Limón Guajes. The production performance was matched by an equally impressive safety performance. “While achieving steady-state throughput of 13,000 tpd in the processing plant remains front and center, we are also focused on reducing reagent consumption associated with soluble iron and on containing costs across the entire business. We have the right team in place and excellent momentum as we head into 2020.”Additionally, the Company notes that current income and mining taxes in respect of 2019 will be paid in Q1 2020 and will result in an operating cash outflow in that quarter.About Torex Gold Resources Inc.Torex is an intermediate gold producer based in Canada, engaged in the exploration, development, and operation of its 100% owned Morelos Gold Property, an area of 29,000 hectares in the highly prospective Guerrero Gold Belt located 180 kilometres southwest of Mexico City.

It is important to note that Muckahi is experimental in nature and has not been tested in an operating mine. Many aspects of the system are conceptual, and proof of concept has not been demonstrated. Drill and blast fundamentals, standards and best practices for underground hard rock mining are applied in the Muckahi, where applicable. The proposed application of a monorail system for underground transportation for mine development and production mining is unique to underground hard rock mining. There are existing underground hard rock mines that use a monorail system for transportation of materials and equipment, however not in the capacity described in the Technical Report. Aspects of Muckahi mining equipment are currently in the design and test stage. The mine design, equipment performance and cost estimations are conceptual in nature, and do not demonstrate technical or economic viability. The Company has completed the development and the first phase of testing the concept for the mine development and production activities and will move to optimization in 2020 to further verify the viability of Muckahi.Story continuesForward Looking StatementsThis press release contains "forward-looking statements" and "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.
