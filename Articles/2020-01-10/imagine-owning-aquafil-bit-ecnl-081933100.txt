Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by Aquafil S.p.A. (BIT:ECNL) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 34%. That's well bellow the market return of 23%. We wouldn't rush to judgement on Aquafil because we don't have a long term history to look at. Check out our latest analysis for Aquafil In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, Aquafil had to report a 53% decline in EPS over the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 34% the share price fall. It may have been that the weak EPS was not as bad as some had feared.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).BIT:ECNL Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Aquafil's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile Aquafil shareholders are down 32% for the year (even including dividends) , the market itself is up 23%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. The share price decline has continued throughout the most recent three months, down 7.4%, suggesting an absence of enthusiasm from investors. Given the relatively short history of this stock, we'd remain pretty wary until we see some strong business performance.
