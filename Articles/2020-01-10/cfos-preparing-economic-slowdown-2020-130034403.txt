While President Trump has hinged his reelection campaign on the strength of the economy, Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are in second and third in national polls, have vowed to make sweeping changes to the current economic system.STRONG US CONSUMER HELPING TO POWER ECONOMY IN 2020Perceptions of the North American economy as “good” rose to 68 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, the study found, while perceptions of the Chinese economy fell to 18 percent.Although optimism for their businesses rose to 11 in the final quarter of the year, it remained among the lowest levels in the past three years. Geopolitical events continued to rattle CFOs' confidence, with executives saying they worried about trade policy, political turmoil, competition, consumer demand and the impending U.S. elections.“This quarter saw even higher concerns about political turmoil, with growing use of the term ‘instability’ and increased mentions of the potential impacts of the 2020 U.S. elections,” the report found. “CFOs also mentioned growing worries about consumer demand and business spending.”CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSFinance chiefs also are facing a battle to hire competent workers: There’s a slowing availability of workers across the enterprise in a historically tight labor market (unemployment remains at a half-century low).
