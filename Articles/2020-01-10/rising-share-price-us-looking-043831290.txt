Looking back a bit further, we're also happy to report the stock is up 56% in the last year.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios.

So if ITAB Shop Concept actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price. I would further inform my view by checking insider buying and selling., among other things.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.ITAB Shop Concept shrunk earnings per share by 33% over the last year. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 5.6% per year over the last five years. This might lead to muted expectations.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).How Does ITAB Shop Concept's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Net debt totals a substantial 104% of ITAB Shop Concept's market cap. This level of debt justifies a relatively low P/E, so remain cognizant of the debt, if you're comparing it to other stocks.The Bottom Line On ITAB Shop Concept's P/E RatioITAB Shop Concept's P/E is 16.5 which is below average (19.4) in the SE market.

If you like to buy stocks that have recently impressed the market, then this one might be a candidate; but if you prefer to invest when there is 'blood in the streets', then you may feel the opportunity has passed.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
