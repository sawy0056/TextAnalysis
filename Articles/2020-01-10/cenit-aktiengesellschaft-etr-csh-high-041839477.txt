Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for CENIT:0.22 = €8.5m ÷ (€88m - €48m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, CENIT has an ROCE of 22%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for CENIT.Do CENIT's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Short term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.CENIT has total liabilities of €48m and total assets of €88m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 55% of its total assets. CENIT boasts an attractive ROCE, even after considering the boost from high current liabilities.What We Can Learn From CENIT's ROCEIn my book, this business could be worthy of further research.
