To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Qian Hu:0.025 = S$1.3m ÷ (S$82m - S$29m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Qian Hu has an ROCE of 2.5%. View our latest analysis for Qian Hu Does Qian Hu Have A Good ROCE?One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies. We can see Qian Hu's ROCE is meaningfully below the Leisure industry average of 9.6%. This could be seen as a negative, as it suggests some competitors may be employing their capital more efficiently. Regardless of how Qian Hu stacks up against its industry, its ROCE in absolute terms is quite low (especially compared to a bank account). There are potentially more appealing investments elsewhere.In our analysis, Qian Hu's ROCE appears to be 2.5%, compared to 3 years ago, when its ROCE was 0.9%. This makes us think about whether the company has been reinvesting shrewdly.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. You can check if Qian Hu has cyclical profits by looking at this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.Do Qian Hu's Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?Short term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Qian Hu has total assets of S$82m and current liabilities of S$29m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 36% of its total assets. With a medium level of current liabilities boosting the ROCE a little, Qian Hu's low ROCE is unappealing.What We Can Learn From Qian Hu's ROCEThis company may not be the most attractive investment prospect.
