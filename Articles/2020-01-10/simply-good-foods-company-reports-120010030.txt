The company completed the acquisition of Quest Nutrition, LLC (“Quest”) on November 7, 2019. The Company’s first quarter results include the effect of 24 days of Quest results. Additionally, note that the Company’s reference to “legacy Atkins” in this press release encompasses Simply Goods Foods’ business excluding Quest.“Simply Good Foods, first quarter results represent a good start to fiscal 2020 as we build on our strong 2019 performance,” said Joseph E. Scalzo, President and Chief Executive Officer of Simply Good Foods. “Our legacy Atkins sales and profit growth were in line with our expectations and positions us nicely to deliver on our financial commitments. We are particularly pleased with our Atkins® brand retail takeaway performance for the thirteen weeks ended December 1, 2019, which increased 10.7% in the U.S. measured channels despite a very difficult comparison in the same period a year ago. In addition to our legacy Atkins growth, Quest contributed to the increased sales and earnings and is a valuable addition to our nutritional snacking portfolio.”"The Quest acquisition is an exciting milestone for Simply Good Foods and strengthens our leadership within the nutritional snacking category. Quest gives us valuable customer and supplier scale while also providing us with a unique brand promise and consumer target. Our branded portfolio capitalizes on the growing consumer mega-trends that include growing snacking incidence and consumer desire for health and wellness, convenience and meal replacement products. We will continue to invest in our brands and are confident in our short and long term plans to drive growth through superior brand marketing and programs, expanded distribution and new products. We remain confident in our business growth opportunities moving forward and our ability to execute against our strategic initiatives to create value for our stockholders.”First Quarter 2019 Financial Highlights vs. First Quarter 2018Net sales increased 25.8%, or $31.2 million, to $152.2 millionGross profit margin of 40.9%, a decrease of 200 basis points
Includes a non-cash $2.4 million inventory purchase accounting step-up adjustment related to the Quest acquisition
Income tax benefit was $1.7 million versus expense of $4.6 millionNet loss of $4.8 million vs. Net income of $15.3 millionAdjusted EBITDA(1) increased 19.1% to $31.8 millionEarnings (loss) per diluted share (“EPS”), $(0.05), a decrease of $0.23 per fully diluted shareAdjusted Diluted EPS (1) of $0.22, the same as the year ago periodNet sales increased $31.2 million, or 25.8%, to $152.2 million, and Quest was approximately a 14.1% benefit to net sales growth. Legacy Atkins net sales increased 11.7%, driven by volume growth, which was partially offset, as expected, by slightly higher trade promotions.Gross profit was $62.2 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $10.3 million or 19.8%. The increase in gross profit was driven by legacy Atkins sales growth and Quest, partially offset by a non-cash $2.4 million inventory purchase accounting step-up adjustment related to the Quest acquisition. As a result, gross margin was 40.9%, a 200 basis point decline versus last year. The non-cash inventory purchase accounting step-up adversely affected gross margin by 160 basis points. Quest’s lower gross margin and the previously mentioned increased trade promotions were a 40 basis point headwind.In the first quarter of 2020 the Company reported a net loss of $4.8 million, compared to net income of $15.3 million for the comparable period of 2019, primarily due to costs related to the Quest acquisition. Specifically, the increase in gross profit was primarily offset by:a 20.3% increase in selling and marketing expenses due to the inclusion of Quest, and the timing of greater legacy Atkins advertising expense discussed last quarter;a 51.2% increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of:
the inclusion of Quest; the timing of higher legacy Atkins incentive compensation discussed last quarter; and integration expenses of $1.4 million;
Business transaction costs of $26.2 million; andHigher net interest income and expense of about $1.1 million due to an increase in the principal amount of the Company’s term loan related to the financing for the Quest acquisition.Adjusted EBITDA1, a non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company that makes certain adjustments to net (loss) income calculated under GAAP, increased 19.1% to $31.8 million.Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share2, a non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company that makes certain adjustments to diluted earnings per share calculated under GAAP, was $0.22, the same as the year ago period.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowOn October 7, 2019, the Company sold about 13.4 million shares of common stock at a net price per share of $26.16 to fund in part the Quest acquisition. Therefore, at the end of the fiscal first quarter weighted average total diluted shares outstanding were approximately 89.7 million versus approximately 82.8 million in the year ago period.As of November 30, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $72.7 million, and $655.5 million in outstanding principal under its term loan. The interest rate on the term loan is LIBOR3 plus 375 basis points. The Company expects to pay down a portion of the $655.5 million term loan during fiscal 2020 and is targeting a trailing twelve month Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 3.75x by fiscal year-end August 2020.Story continuesOutlook“We are pleased with our start to the year and the progress we are making against our strategic initiatives that build on our existing capabilities and strengthen our brands. Of course, one of our key goals in 2020 is the integration of Quest. I'm pleased to report that this work is well underway and progressing as planned. Collaboration of both leadership teams is excellent and gives us confidence that we will deliver on our integration plans. We have good marketplace momentum across the business and are confident in achieving our fiscal 2020 financial commitments,” Scalzo concluded.For the full year fiscal 2020, the Company updated its outlook for the acquisition of Quest and anticipates full-year net sales of $850-870 million and Adjusted EBITDA1,4 of $154-158 million. The outlook for legacy Atkins net sales and Adjusted EBITDA1,4 growth remains unchanged from guidance provided on October 29, 2019. Recall, the Company expects legacy Atkins net sales growth for the fifty-two weeks ended August 29, 2020, to be at the high end of its long-term net sales growth target of 4% to 6% versus the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2019. Legacy Atkins Adjusted EBITDA1,4 is expect to grow at a somewhat higher rate than its expectation for net sales. Additionally, the Company estimates that the extra week included in fiscal year 2019 is a headwind to year-over-year comparisons of reported legacy Atkins net sales growth in fiscal 2020 of about 2%.The Company anticipates 2020 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share2,4 to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.95. This is an increase of 17% to 23% versus Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share1 of $0.77 in 2019.________________________________________ (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to “Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA” in this press release for an explanation and reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure.
(2) Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company excludes acquisition related costs, such as business transaction costs, integration expense and depreciation and amortization expense in calculating Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share.

(4) The Company does not provide a forward-looking reconciliation of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to Earnings Per Share or Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, expected for 2020, because we are unable to provide such a reconciliation without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain components of the respective reconciliations, including the timing of and amount of integration costs associated with the Quest acquisition, and the inherent difficulty of predicting what the changes in these components will be throughout the fiscal year. As these items may vary greatly between periods, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could significantly affect our future financial results.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net (loss) income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). Simply Good Foods defines Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) as net (loss) income before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization with further adjustments to exclude the following items: business transaction costs, stock-based compensation expense, inventory step-up, integration costs, non-core legal costs, loss in fair value change of contingent consideration - TRA liability, gain on settlement of TRA liability and other non-core expenses. The Company believes that the inclusion of these supplementary adjustments in presenting Adjusted EBITDA, when used in conjunction with net (loss) income, are appropriate to provide additional information to investors, reflects more accurately operating results of the on-going operations, enhances the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allows for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics the Company uses in its financial and operational decision making. The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in the non-GAAP calculation.The following unaudited tables below provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net (loss) income, for the thirteen weeks November 30, 2019 and November 24, 2018: Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share as an indicator of operating performance. Simply Good Foods defines Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as diluted earnings (loss) per share before depreciation and amortization, business transaction costs, stock-based compensation expense, inventory step-up, integration costs, non-core legal costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration - TRA liability, gain on settlement of TRA liability and other non-core expenses, on a theoretical tax effected basis of such adjustments at an assumed statutory rate. The Company believes that the inclusion of these supplementary adjustments in presenting Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, when used in conjunction with diluted earnings per share, are appropriate to provide additional information to investors, reflects more accurately operating results of the on-going operations, enhances the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allows for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics the Company uses in its financial and operational decision making.
