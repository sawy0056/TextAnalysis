The account's post received over 25,000 shares."The support of large companies for sexual minorities is one of the important factors for sexual minorities to gain visibility and be seen and recognized by the public. Thank you Tmall!" wrote Lovematters.Alibaba did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for further comment on the ad.One top-rated comment on Weibo described the position of the Alibaba's ad as clever.The spot "doesn't directly support or not support [same-sex realtions], but the fact that we can see it is already an amazing step," the commentor wrote.Alibaba has supported China's gay community in the past. In 2017, the company teamed up with gay dating app Blued and flew 10 couples to Los Angeles for a week-long trip that included a group wedding ceremony.(Reporting by Josh Horwitz; additional reporting by the Shanghai newsroom; Editing by Michael Perry)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextVirus detected in sub-Saharan Africa, global stocks tankAFPJapan's January factory output beats forecasts but slowdown expectedReutersBTS cancel concerts as South Korea coronavirus cases pass 2,000AFPNations take drastic measures as coronavirus outbreak spreadsMarketWatchAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
