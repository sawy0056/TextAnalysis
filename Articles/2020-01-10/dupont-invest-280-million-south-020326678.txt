Japan produces around 90% of photoresists.The ministry official said Dupont's Korean subsidiary currently produces photoresists, but not ones needed to make chips with an advanced technique known as extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography.The new investment will also go towards the production of CMP pads, which are polishing pads used during the semiconductor manufacturing process, the ministry said.A representative for the U.S. industrial materials maker was not immediately available for comment.(Reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Hyunjoo Jin and Edwina Gibbs)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextJapan PM defends school closure plan despite criticsAFPJapan's January factory output beats forecasts but slowdown expectedReutersJPMorgan Joins Rush to Curb Global Travel as Virus SpreadsBloombergBTS cancel concerts as South Korea coronavirus cases pass 2,000AFPNations take drastic measures as coronavirus outbreak spreadsMarketWatchBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
