Is Komax Holding AG (VTX:KOMN) A Good Fit?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 9, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosCould Komax Holding AG (VTX:KOMN) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.A 3.0% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests Komax Holding has some staying power. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Komax Holding for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Komax Holding! SWX:KOMN Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 79% of Komax Holding's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Last year, Komax Holding paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Komax Holding's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Komax Holding has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was CHF2.00 in 2010, compared to CHF7.00 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 13% per year over this time. Komax Holding's dividend payments have fluctuated, so it hasn't grown 13% every year, but the CAGR is a useful rule of thumb for approximating the historical growth.It's not great to see that the payment has been cut in the past. We're generally more wary of companies that have cut their dividend before, as they tend to perform worse in an economic downturn.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. In the last five years, Komax Holding's earnings per share have shrunk at approximately 2.7% per annum. A modest decline in earnings per share is not great to see, but it doesn't automatically make a dividend unsustainable. Still, we'd vastly prefer to see EPS growth when researching dividend stocks.Story continuesConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Komax Holding's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we think Komax Holding has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. Earnings per share are down, and Komax Holding's dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. There are a few too many issues for us to get comfortable with Komax Holding from a dividend perspective. Businesses can change, but we would struggle to identify why an investor should rely on this stock for their income.Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from costs or inflation.
