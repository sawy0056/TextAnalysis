Growth, however, will accelerate marginally to 2.5% in 2020, estimates the World Bank report. “This modest increase in global growth marks the end of the slowdown that started in 2018 and took a heavy toll on global activity, trade, and investment, especially last year,” said the World Bank’s lead economic forecaster, Ayhan Kose.The marginal improvement in 2020, however, remains vulnerable to certain risks, including the “possibility of a re-escalation of global trade tensions, sharp downturns in major economies, and financial disruptions,” said the report.“We do expect an improvement, but overall, we also see a weaker growth outlook,” Kose added.US Growth ExpectationsThe U.S. growth could slow down from 2.3% in 2019 to 1.8% in 2020 and then could slow further to 1.7% in both 2021 and 2022, reported the New York Times, citing the World Bank report.0See more from BenzingaMcDonald's Faces Lawsuit Over Alleged Discrimination Against Black Franchisees, StaffGoogle's Travel Site Updated To Provide More InfoMergers, Acquisitions In Japan Could Lose Momentum Amid Global Recession Fears© 2020 Benzinga.com.
