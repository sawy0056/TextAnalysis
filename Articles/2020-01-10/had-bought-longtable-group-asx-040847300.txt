We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. For example, we sympathize with anyone who was caught holding Longtable Group Limited (ASX:LON) during the five years that saw its share price drop a whopping 85%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 56%. Furthermore, it's down 14% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.We really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio. Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson. View our latest analysis for Longtable Group Given that Longtable Group didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.Over five years, Longtable Group grew its revenue at 79% per year. That's better than most loss-making companies. So on the face of it we're really surprised to see the share price has averaged a fall of 32% each year, in the same time period. It could be that the stock was over-hyped before. We'd recommend carefully checking for indications of future growth - and balance sheet threats - before considering a purchase.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).ASX:LON Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Longtable Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 23% in the last year, Longtable Group shareholders lost 55%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 31% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
