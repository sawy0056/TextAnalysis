But as Warren Buffett has mused, 'If you've been playing poker for half an hour and you still don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy.' When they buy such story stocks, investors are all too often the patsy.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Lifestyle China Group (HKG:2136). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. Check out our latest analysis for Lifestyle China Group Lifestyle China Group's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Lifestyle China Group grew its EPS by 15% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While Lifestyle China Group may have maintained EBIT margins over the last year, revenue has fallen. And that does make me a little more cautious of the stock.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So we're pleased to report that Lifestyle China Group insiders own a meaningful share of the business. In fact, they own 75% of the company, so they will share in the same delights and challenges experienced by the ordinary shareholders. This makes me think they will be incentivised to plan for the long term - something I like to see. And their holding is extremely valuable at the current share price, totalling CN¥2.5b. That means they have plenty of their own capital riding on the performance of the business!Should You Add Lifestyle China Group To Your Watchlist?As I already mentioned, Lifestyle China Group is a growing business, which is what I like to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination appeals to me, for one. So yes, I do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Of course, just because Lifestyle China Group is growing does not mean it is undervalued.
