(TSE:TVK) Have A Good P/E Ratio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 9, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosTerraVest Industries (TSE:TVK) shares have given back plenty of recent gains in the last month, dropping . The stock has been solid, longer term, gaining 17% in the last year.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. See our latest analysis for TerraVest Industries How Does TerraVest Industries's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?TerraVest Industries's P/E of 9.97 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. If you look at the image below, you can see TerraVest Industries has a lower P/E than the average (16.5) in the energy services industry classification.TSX:TVK Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 9th 2020MoreThis suggests that market participants think TerraVest Industries will underperform other companies in its industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Notably, TerraVest Industries grew EPS by a whopping 36% in the last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 18% per year over the last five years. So we'd generally expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting TerraVest Industries's P/E?Net debt is 48% of TerraVest Industries's market cap. While that's enough to warrant consideration, it doesn't really concern us.The Verdict On TerraVest Industries's P/E RatioTerraVest Industries's P/E is 10.0 which is below average (15.7) in the CA market. The company does have a little debt, and EPS growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified. Given TerraVest Industries's P/E ratio has declined from 10.0 to 10.0 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is more worried about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for deep value investors this stock might justify some research.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. We don't have analyst forecasts, but you might want to assess this data-rich visualization of earnings, revenue and cash flow.But note: TerraVest Industries may not be the best stock to buy.
