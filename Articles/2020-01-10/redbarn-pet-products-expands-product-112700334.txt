It's just one of many improved recipes to come."Another of these new recipes is Redbarn's Superfood Fetchers, available in a medium or large stick.

Mangos contain over 20 different vitamins and minerals. And, chia seeds contain five times more calcium than whole milk, more than double the iron of raw spinach, 15 times more magnesium than broccoli, and 200 times more omega-3 than wild salmon, according to the USDA and National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference.                                      The combined ingredients in Superfood Fetchers are a natural source of chondroitin, supporting optimal joint health.
