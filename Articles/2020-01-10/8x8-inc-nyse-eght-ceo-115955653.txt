(NYSE:EGHT). This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally - as a second measure of performance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. View our latest analysis for 8x8 How Does Vik Verma's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?Our data indicates that 8x8, Inc. is worth US$1.9b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$5.1m for the year to March 2019. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$490k. We further remind readers that the CEO may face performance requirements to receive the non-salary part of the total compensation. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations from US$1.0b to US$3.2b, and the median CEO total compensation was US$3.9m.It would therefore appear that 8x8, Inc. pays Vik Verma more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into the underlying business performance.You can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at 8x8, below.NYSE:EGHT CEO Compensation, January 9th 2020MoreIs 8x8, Inc.
