Many companies are specializing in their manufacturing, along with companies developing peptide-based products ranging from new drug candidates to medical diagnostic devices. The massive increase in the cost and time span to develop a conventional drug led researchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop new cost-effective products based of synthetic peptide strategy, which led to development large number of peptides of medical importance.The lower toxicity levels of peptides can be credited to both their lower instance of interaction with other molecules not of interest and also to their ease of metabolism into their component amino acid residues. Pharmaceutical companies are attracted towards the peptides due to ease of manufacturing. In contrast to the old trial and error routines, nowadays the process starts with a clear understanding of the disease on a molecular level and based over the hypotheses of drug outcome, new drugs are designed.The necessity of peptides as new innovative drug development has also been raised by the property of peptides being bioactive as considered one of the major interests of pharmaceuticals. As compared to synthetic substances peptides degrade into their component proteinogenic amino acid without leading to toxic metabolites. Furthermore, a disadvantage can sometimes be an advantage as peptides possess short half-lives which make them costly on one hand but the advantage is less accumulation in the body."Global Peptide Drug Market Is Projected To Surpass US$ 60 Billion By 2026 Driven By Strong Clinical Pipeline & Favorable Commercialization Parameters"In reference to these favourable attributes, the peptide drug market is flourishing and several peptide-based therapeutics have been commercialized. With enhanced technologies, the prospects of the peptide drugs are getting influential day by day and new peptides are being discovered to be developed as peptide drug. Peptide therapeutics is completely different from the traditional way and may open a new window for finding completely new peptide drugs. Also, bioinformatics and systematic biological approaches help in searching for potential peptide drug candidates based on the knowledge and data.The future potential of expanding peptide therapeutics market is contributed towards the characteristics like safety, targeted drug delivery and high specificity. Especially for illnesses requiring prolonged therapy, peptides have a competitive advantage over conventional small molecule drugs. Due to their extremely high specificity for their intended target, in combination with the fact that they are extra cellularly active, much lower amounts can be formulated.Key Topics Covered: Introduction to Peptide TherapeuticsFoundation of Peptide TherapeuticsKey Aspects in Peptide Drug DevelopmentPeptide Therapeutics over Traditional MoleculesGlobal Peptide Therapeutics Market ScenarioGlobal Peptide Oncology Thereupetics Market ScenarioCancer Peptides Drug Cost, Dosage & Patent InsightPeptide Therapeutics in Cardiovascular DiseasePeptide Therapeutics in Metabolic DisorderPeptide Therapeutics For InfectionsPeptide Therapeutics aganist CNS DisordersGlobal Peptides Drug Clinical Insight by TypeGlobal Peptide Drug Market Dynamics - Challenges & DriversGlobal Peptide Therapeutics Market Future PanoramaOligopeptides Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseInsulin Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhasePeptide Hormone Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhasePeptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseGlucagon-Like Peptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseGlycopeptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseMultiple Peptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhasePeptide vaccine Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseCyclic Peptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhasePeptide Fragment Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseDipeptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseOpioid peptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseDepsipeptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseNatriuretic Peptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseNeuropeptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhasePituitary Gonadotropin Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseLipopeptide Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhasePeptide Aptamer Clinical Pipeline By Company, Indication & PhaseCompetitive Landscape Companies Mentioned AmgenAmylin PharmaceuticalsApitope TechnologyBioPartnersBiondVax Pharmaceuticals LtdBoehringer IngelheimCircassiaCorden Pharma (Peptisyntha)Eli LilyGalena BiopharmaceuticalsGlaxoSmithKlineHyperion TherapeuticsImmunoCellular TherapeuticsIpsenLonzaMerckNovoNordiskPar PharmaceuticalsPeptiDreamRocheSanofiTarix PharmaceuticalsFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/gepoydAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com ResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.
