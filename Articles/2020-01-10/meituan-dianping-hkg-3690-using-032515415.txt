When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Meituan Dianping (HKG:3690) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Meituan Dianping What Is Meituan Dianping's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2019 Meituan Dianping had debt of CN¥4.08b, up from CN¥1.5k in one year.

Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of CN¥61.2b as well as receivables valued at CN¥783.6m due within 12 months. So it actually has CN¥24.5b more liquid assets than total liabilities.This short term liquidity is a sign that Meituan Dianping could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Succinctly put, Meituan Dianping boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load! The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.

Shareholders probably have their fingers crossed that it can grow its way to profits.So How Risky Is Meituan Dianping?Statistically speaking companies that lose money are riskier than those that make money. And in the last year Meituan Dianping had negative earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), truth be told. Indeed, in that time it burnt through CN¥6.7b of cash and made a loss of CN¥2.6b.
