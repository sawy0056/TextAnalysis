Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Yip's Chemical Holdings:0.077 = HK$367m ÷ (HK$8.0b - HK$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Yip's Chemical Holdings has an ROCE of 7.7%.
