The portal manages customer-facing and back-office transactions for Belgium- and German-based customers. By providing the low-code platform to create the RaboDirect portal, Mendix has helped to reduce IT costs by 50% and attributed to delivering a seamless digital customer experience."Across the financial industry, system updates required by regulatory compliance are often prioritized before improving the customer experience," says Bram Voogel, customer success director at Mendix. "For any bank operating in this market it's a competitive advantage to be able to prioritize customer attraction and retention with new online capabilities for its products. Mendix's low-code platform turned out to be the perfect fit to help achieve this objective." A platform that empowers coding professionals and business developersSystems of competitive differentiation, which have a direct impact on the customer experience, were brought in-house. Mendix's low-code platform was used to rebuild the bank's online channel, enabling the IT division to weekly release cycles. The ability of IT coding professionals to collaborate with small teams of nontechnical business developers using Mendix's drop and drag functionality enabled this close alignment with business objectives and customer needs."It's a significant milestone that the division's IT department is able to work in short sprints in the application development process. It was rewarding to see developers and business professionals working very closely together with the Mendix platform to create satisfying products for Rabobank's customers in Germany and Belgium," adds Hans de Visser, vice president of product management at Mendix.Mendix's collaborative approach enabled business experts and professional coders to quickly scale application development. Seeing big savings and fast results from empowered, energized teamwork at Rabobank is a clear demonstration of what the term 'digital transformation' means in practice and how Mendix can attribute to this.More information about Mendix's work with Rabobank can be found in this blog post and customer success video.For more information about how Mendix can help transform your business, please visit www.mendix.com.Connect with MendixFollow @Mendix on Twitter Connect with Mendix on LinkedIn Follow Rabobank on LinkedInAbout MendixMendix, a Siemens business and the global leader in low-code and no-code application development for the enterprise, is fundamentally reinventing the way applications are built in the digital enterprise.
