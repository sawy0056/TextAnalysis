But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Elecosoft plc (LON:ELCO) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 293% in five years. View our latest analysis for Elecosoft To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Elecosoft managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 31% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).AIM:ELCO Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how Elecosoft has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Elecosoft's TSR for the last 5 years was 307%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Elecosoft shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 20% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, that falls short of the 32% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders.
