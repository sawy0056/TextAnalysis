Caesar is participating in the highly-regarded Dopey Challenge, a four-day series of races, including the Walt Disney World® Marathon, Walt Disney World® Half Marathon, Walt Disney World® 10K, and Walt Disney World® 5K.A military veteran, Caesar suffered a motorized vehicle accident that left her with a brain injury and physical difficulties that included being unable to swallow or use her voice properly. Caesar went on to regain her ability to speak and swallow and ultimately became a speech pathologist for Autistic children."I'm so grateful for the support Cigna gave me in one of my hardest moments," said Caesar. "It's because of the team at Cigna that I'm here today running the Dopey Challenge. But more importantly, I'm doing it to show everyone out there facing similar challenges that anything is possible when you commit to a goal and find a community that supports you."Story continuesCaesar will be guided by a group of Cigna employees. Cigna employees will serve as guides for several other racers with differing abilities, many of whom are athletes with Achilles International and The Achilles Freedom Team. Achilles International is a non-profit organization dedicated to enabling people with disabilities participate in mainstream athletic events. The Freedom Team is comprised of military veterans who have come back from the battlefield to participate in running events."We're so inspired to see runners with differing abilities all running together side by side," said Huggins.
