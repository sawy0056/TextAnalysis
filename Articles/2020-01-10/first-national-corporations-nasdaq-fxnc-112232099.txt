But plenty of shareholders will still be smiling, given that the stock is up 11% over the last quarter. Looking back over the last year, the stock has been a solid performer, with a gain of 12%.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. See our latest analysis for First National Does First National Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 11.13 that sentiment around First National isn't particularly high. If you look at the image below, you can see First National has a lower P/E than the average (12.9) in the banks industry classification.NasdaqCM:FXNC Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 9th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that First National shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.First National maintained roughly steady earnings over the last twelve months. But EPS is up 22% over the last 3 years. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 2.5% per year over the last five years. So we might expect a relatively low P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.First National's Balance SheetFirst National has net cash of US$16m. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Verdict On First National's P/E RatioFirst National trades on a P/E ratio of 11.1, which is below the US market average of 18.8. Earnings improved over the last year. And the healthy balance sheet means the company can sustain growth while the P/E suggests shareholders don't think it will. What can be absolutely certain is that the market has become less optimistic about First National over the last month, with the P/E ratio falling from 11.1 back then to 11.1 today. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
