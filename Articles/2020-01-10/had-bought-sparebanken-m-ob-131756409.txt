Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Sparebanken Møre share price has climbed 47% in five years, easily topping the market return of 30% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 18% , including dividends . See our latest analysis for Sparebanken Møre To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Sparebanken Møre actually saw its EPS drop 1.6% per year.So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We note that the dividend is higher than it was previously - always nice to see. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).OB:MORG Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at Sparebanken Møre's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Sparebanken Møre the TSR over the last 5 years was 97%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Sparebanken Møre shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 18% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
