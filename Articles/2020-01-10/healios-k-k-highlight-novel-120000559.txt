Morgan Healthcare Conference and Biotech Showcase in San Francisco, CAPR NewswireJanuary 9, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareTOKYO, Jan. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Healios K.K. ("the Company"); (TSE: 4593), Japan's leading clinical stage biotechnology company harnessing the potential of stem cells for regenerative therapies announces that its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hardy TS Kagimoto, MD, will provide a strategic overview and company update at the 38th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. In addition, the Company's CFO Richard Kincaid will make a presentation at the Biotech Showcase also being held in San Francisco, CA, between 13-16 January 2020. The Company will hold meetings with investors around both events.Healios will present its unique strategy in regenerative medicine, which combines near-term and potentially accelerated commercialization of Somatic Stem Cell (SSC) -based treatments in Japan, with the development of next generation therapies derived from its world-leading induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) technology platform.  Healios's SSC candidate (HLCM051) is in a pivotal Phase 2/3 trial in Japan in ischemic stroke in which it offers the potential to provide an effective treatment over a much longer treatment window as compared with standard-of-care acute therapies, such as clot-dissolving agents.HLCM051 is also in a Phase 2 trial in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Japan aiming to become the first approved therapeutic drug for this serious medical condition.Pending the successful completion of these studies, Healios intends to pursue an accelerated path to approval and commercialization owing to Japan's progressive and positive regulatory framework for regenerative medicine (known as the Conditional and time-limited authorization system, or "SAKIGAKE" in Japanese*).In parallel, Healios is developing a proprietary gene-modified iPSC platform of non-immunogenic, off-the-shelf (allogenic) 'Universal Donor Cells' for applications in next-generation therapies in ophthalmology (wet and dry age-related macular degeneration), organ regeneration (e.g. following metabolic liver disease), and immuno-oncology (targeting solid tumors) including the development of iPSC derived gene-modified natural killer cells. These next generation iPSCs offer the potential for avoiding the requirement for immunosuppressive drug treatment while offering long duration of effect.Details of the presentations are as follows:At the J.P.

It provides a process for the accelerated authorization of unapproved drugs for serious and life-threatening diseases and aims to improve the environment for companies to undertake development of such drugs.About HealiosHealios is Japan's leading clinical stage biotechnology company harnessing the potential of stem cells for regenerative medicine.
