This surging volume of claims points to a growing reliance on pet insurance to offset the cost of pet medical care as well as pet owner preferences for digital and mobile tools to manage pet care.“Pet owners are committed to the health and wellbeing of their pets but are increasingly caught between the expense of properly caring for them and the use of outdated communications and interactions with veterinary practices,” said Mark Olcott, DVM, CEO and co-founder of VitusVet. “Reaching this claims milestone demonstrates that pet insurance, coupled with the rise of convenient mobile and digital tools for vet practices and pet owners alike, can help make caring for a pet easier and more affordable.”The overall amount of money spent on pet care in America is increasing, with the market reaching $72 billion in 2018. This is being driven by several factors, including the growing number of households with pets, a rise in the cost and frequency of veterinary care due to longer pet lifespans, and a greater willingness by owners to spend on premium food, toys, supplements and more. Pet insurance is a growing industry that can help offset the cost of expensive health care for pets.The VitusVet mobile app, which is available for Android and iOS mobile devices, offers pet owners an easy, digital process to file pet insurance claims. Pet owners are asked to simply confirm pet information, add claim information and receipts, and review the claim prior to submission.Additionally, pet owners can take advantage of other convenient features of the app including accessing their pet medical records, receiving appointment, food and medication reminders, and sharing access with family, pet sitters and walkers as well as veterinarians.Veterinary practices have also benefited from the VitusVet technology, which allows them to streamline their appointment processes, simplify service and refill reminders, begin texting with pet owners and monitor their practice's performance.To learn more about pet insurance for your dog, cat, bird or other companion animal, visit www.petinsurance.com.
