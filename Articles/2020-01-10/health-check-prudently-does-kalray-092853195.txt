So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Kalray S.A. (EPA:ALKAL) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Kalray How Much Debt Does Kalray Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2019 Kalray had €6.93m of debt, an increase on €6.5, over one year. But it also has €23.3m in cash to offset that, meaning it has €16.4m net cash.ENXTPA:ALKAL Historical Debt, January 9th 2020MoreHow Healthy Is Kalray's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Kalray had liabilities of €6.35m due within 12 months, and liabilities of €8.49m due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of €23.3m and €4.74m worth of receivables due within a year. So it can boast €13.2m more liquid assets than total liabilities.This short term liquidity is a sign that Kalray could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Succinctly put, Kalray boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load! When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Kalray can strengthen its balance sheet over time.

And in the last year Kalray had negative earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), truth be told. And over the same period it saw negative free cash outflow of €9.3m and booked a €7.8m accounting loss. But at least it has €16.4m on the balance sheet to spend on growth, near-term.
