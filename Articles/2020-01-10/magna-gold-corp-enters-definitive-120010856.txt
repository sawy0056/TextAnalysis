Of the deposits within the Caborca Orogenic Gold Belt there are a number of large open pit heap leach gold operations such as La Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Nochebuena (Fresnillo PLC), San Francisco mine (Alio Gold Inc.), Cerro Colorado (GoldGroup Mining Inc.) and El Chanate (Alamos Gold Inc).  Historic estimates of the combined gold reserves and resources identified within the trend to date total in excess of 10 million ounces (Izaguirre et al., 2017), which is based on prior data and reports obtained and prepared by previous operators (Figure 2).Figure 2. San Judas project locationhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/512d969a-5831-4b43-874c-f335960bded8San Judas is an early stage exploration project hosting structurally controlled mineralization within lithologies similar in age to the La Herradura and San Francisco gold mines.  The project is underlain by a basement composed of a Precambrian aged igneous-metamorphic sequence including granite, gneiss, pegmatites and schists. Augen gneiss is locally present and is likely derived from pegmatitic granitic protolith.  The entire sequence is affected by multiple deformations and the emplacement of intrusions such as leucocratic granites and andesitic dikes.Structural and lithological interpretation of available data suggest the mineralized structures, characterized by gold-bearing quartz veins and mineralized quartz-sericite altered hanging-wall rocks extend under the surface. Magna is currently carrying out a comprehensive surface exploration program including geological and structural mapping, trenching and reconnaissance sampling in conjunction with a surface geophysical program to define targets in anticipation of a maiden drilling campaign.Qualified Person James Baughman (P.
