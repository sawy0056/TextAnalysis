Agreement to Acquire Detour Gold Corporation
Company announced agreement to acquire all common shares of Detour Gold Corporation (“Detour”) on November 25, 2019; Acquisition will add third cornerstone asset, Detour Lake Mine, located in Ontario, Canada, increase Company’s free cash flow, Mineral Reserves and production, offer opportunities for synergies and other value creation opportunities totaling $75 – $100 million per year and combine Kirkland Lake Gold’s industry-leading balance sheet strength with Detour Lake’s exceptional growth, expansion and exploration potential. (Meeting of Kirkland Lake Gold shareholders to be held on January 28, 2020). (See section “Detour Transaction” later in this press release for further details.)
Tony Makuch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kirkland Lake Gold, commented: “Kirkland Lake Gold had its best year ever in 2019. We increased production 35%, more than doubled our cash position and continued to achieve significant exploration success. We also raised our dividend twice, repurchased 1,127,000 shares through our NCIB and increased our share price by 60% for the year. Both Fosterville and Macassa had excellent years in 2019, with Fosterville easily beating full-year production guidance and Macassa producing over 240,000 ounces, in line with target levels. Looking at exploration, recently released drill results at Fosterville and Macassa are very encouraging and support our view that these mines are not only among the world’s most profitable operations, they also represent two of the most exciting exploration projects in the gold industry today. Also contributing to our organic growth potential is our work in the Northern Territory of Australia, where advanced exploration work is progressing with a goal of resuming commercial operations as early as next month when we release our updated Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates. Providing additional upside for the future is our recent agreement to acquire Detour Gold, where we see opportunities for substantial value creation through investment in Detour Lake Mine’s considerable growth, expansion and exploration potential.“Turning to Q4 2019, we achieved a record quarter, producing close to 280,000 ounces, well above the previous quarterly record of 248,400 ounces set in Q3 2019. The record performance resulted from an outstanding quarter at Fosterville, where grades averaged just under 50 grams per tonne, the mine’s highest average quarterly grade ever by a wide margin. The average grade at Fosterville was better than expected, mainly due to grade outperformance at a number of stopes in the high-grade Swan Zone. In Canada, we had a solid performance during the quarter at Macassa, as higher throughput levels largely offset the impact lower than expected grades, and achieved improved results at the Holt Complex, with Q4 2019 being the strongest quarter of the year at these operations.“Finally, we have watched with great concern and empathy the devastating impact of recent bush fires along the eastern seaboard of Victoria and New South Wales in Australia. As a result, Kirkland Lake Gold is donating A$1.0 million to support relief and recovery efforts. In addition, we are also initiating a program with CFA (Country Fire Authority) units to assist in funding new projects aimed at improving fire readiness. Our operations in Australia have not been affected by the fires, but clearly the impact in many areas has been severe and we are pleased to be contributing to the massive relief and recovery effort required in the aftermath of the fires.”Story continuesQ4 and FY 2019 Production Results1   Q4 2019 Q4 2018 Q3 2019 FY 2019 FY 2018

FY 2019 Production (ozs) 241,297 113,952 619,366 974,615 FY 2019 production achieved the Company’s guidance of 950,000 – 1,000,000 ounces, totaling 974,615 ounces. FY 2019 production increased 35% from 723,701 ounces in FY 2018. The main contributor to the strong growth compared to FY 2018 was record production at Fosterville, mainly due to a significant improvement in the average grade reflecting the ramp up of production from the high-grade Swan Zone. Production from Fosterville in FY 2019 of 619,366 was better than the guidance range of 570,000 – 610,000 ounces due to a higher than expected average grade, largely during Q4 2019. Macassa produced 241,297 ounces in FY 2019, in line with FY 2019 guidance of 240,000 – 250,000 ounces and largely unchanged from FY 2018. The Holt Complex produced 113,952 ounces in FY 2019 compared to 127,344 ounces in FY 2018 and below revised guidance of 120,000 – 130,000 ounces. The Company continues to review the future plans for the Holt Complex operations.Review of Operating MinesFosterville The Fosterville Mine produced 191,893 ounces in Q4 2019, an increase of 54% from 124,307 ounces in Q4 2018 and 21% higher than 158,327 ounces the previous quarter. Production in Q4 2019 resulted from processing 121,998 tonnes at a record average grade of 49.3 g/t and with record average mill recoveries of 99.2%. The growth in production from both prior periods reflected higher average grades, increased tonnes processed and improved recoveries. The average grade increased 24% from Q4 2018 and 18% from the previous quarter, with the increase from both prior periods largely due to grade outperformance in a number of Swan Zone stopes during Q4 2019. Higher levels of production from the Swan Zone also contributed to the increase in average grade compared to Q4 2018.Production at Fosterville for FY 2019 totaled 619,366 ounces, a 74% increase from 356,230 ounces in FY 2018. FY 2019 production resulted from processing 492,874 tonnes at an average grade of 39.6 g/t and average recoveries of 98.8%. The increase from FY 2018 was largely due to a 59% improvement in the average grade, largely reflecting the ramp up of production from the Swan Zone, which commenced in Q3 2018. Mill throughput levels also contributed to the increase, with an average of 1,350 tonnes per day being processed in FY 2019, in line with expected levels and higher than the 1,250 tonnes per day processed in FY 2018. Average recovery rates also improved year over year.Macassa  The Macassa Mine produced 56,379 ounces in Q4 2019 compared to 69,936 ounces in Q4 2018 and 62,945 ounces the previous quarter. Production in Q4 2019 resulted from processing 87,573 tonnes at an average grade of 20.5 g/t with average recoveries of 97.8%. The change in production from both prior periods resulted from a lower average grade in Q4 2019, largely reflecting grade underperformance in certain stopes, which more than offset the impact of higher tonnes processed. Tonnes processed in Q4 2019 averaged 952 tonnes per day versus 930 tonnes per day in Q4 2018 and 933 tonnes per day the previous quarter.Production at Macassa in FY 2019 totaled 241,297 ounces, largely unchanged from 240,126 ounces in FY 2018. Production in FY 2019 resulted from processing 324,077 tonnes at an average grade of 23.6 g/t with average recoveries of 97.9%, which compared to processing 354,469 tonnes at an average grade of 21.6 g/t with average recoveries of 97.7% during FY 2018. The impact of a higher average grade in FY 2019 compared to FY 2018 was largely offset by reduced tonnes processed compared to FY 2018. The increase in the average grade in FY 2019 largely resulted from grade outperformance in a number of stopes around the 5700 Level of the South Mine Complex, largely in the first quarter of the year. Tonnes processed in FY 2019 averaged 888 tonnes per day compared to 971 tonnes per day for the same period in 2018. Contributing to the reduction in tonnes processed in FY 2019 were lower than expected processing rates during the second quarter of 2019 largely reflecting the impact of excessive water in the mine during the spring run-off, which limited the use of the lower loading pocket at the #3 Shaft.Holt ComplexDuring Q4 2019, the Holt Complex produced 31,469 ounces based on processing 252,801 tonnes at an average grade of 4.1 g/t with average recoveries of 94.1%. Production in Q4 2019 compared to production of 36,974 ounces in Q4 2018 when a total of 227,940 tonnes were processed at an average grade of 5.3 g/t with average recoveries of 94.7%. The change from Q4 2018 largely reflected a lower average grade at both Holt Mine and Taylor Mine, which more than offset the impact of 5,797 ounces of production at Holloway Mine in Q4 2019 following the resumption of commercial operation at Holloway during the first quarter of 2019 (895 ounces produced in Q4 2018 resulting from the processing of stockpiled material). Production in Q4 2019 of 31,469 ounces compared to production of 27,128 ounces the previous quarter when a total of 214,542 tonnes were processed at an average grade of 4.2 g/t with average recoveries of 94.2%. The increase from Q3 2019 reflected higher production at the Holt Mine, reflecting both increased mill throughput and an increase in the average grade, as well as increased production from Holloway, where 3,792 ounces were produced in Q3 2019.In 2019, the Holt Complex produced 113,952 ounces from processing 853,528 tonnes at an average grade of 4.4 g/t with average recoveries of 94.7%. FY 2019 production compared to 127,344 ounces of production for FY 2018 when a total of 860,022 tonnes at an average grade of 4.9 g/t with average recoveries of 94.7%. The reduction versus YTD 2018 reflected lower tonnes processed and average grades at Holt Mine and significantly reduced tonnes processed at Taylor. The Holloway Mine produced 12,210 ounces in YTD 2019 compared to 942 ounces for the same period in 2018.Northern TerritoryTest processing of low-grade mineralization from the Lantern Deposit at the Cosmo Mine commenced in early October 2019. A total of 8,733 ounces were produced at the Union Reefs Mill during Q4 2019, with the proceeds from gold sales being accounted for as a reduction in capital expenditures. The processing of Lantern mineralization is being undertaken as part of an advanced exploration program aimed at evaluating a potential resumption of operations in the Northern Territory of Australia. The advanced exploration program is expected to continue into 2020, with proceeds from gold sales continuing to reduce capital expenditures pending a decision to resume commercial operations, which could be made as early as February 2020 following release of the Company’s Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates as at December 31, 2019.Detour TransactionOn November 25, 2019, the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all issued and outstanding common shares of Detour pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “Transaction”).The Kirkland Lake Gold Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Kirkland Lake Gold shareholders vote FOR the Transaction.
