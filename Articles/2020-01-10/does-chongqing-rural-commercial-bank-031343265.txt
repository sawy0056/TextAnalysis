So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).How Does Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank has net debt worth just 4.4% of its market capitalization.
