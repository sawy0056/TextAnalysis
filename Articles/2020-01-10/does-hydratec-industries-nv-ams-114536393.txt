That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Hydratec Industries Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio.

I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.Hydratec Industries shrunk earnings per share by 26% over the last year. But it has grown its earnings per share by 9.7% per year over the last five years. And EPS is down 6.7% a year, over the last 3 years. This could justify a low P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.How Does Hydratec Industries's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Hydratec Industries has net debt equal to 38% of its market cap. While it's worth keeping this in mind, it isn't a worry.The Verdict On Hydratec Industries's P/E RatioHydratec Industries's P/E is 11.9 which is below average (20.7) in the NL market.
