But shareholders may not all be feeling jubilant, since the share price is still down 19% in the last year.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. See our latest analysis for Wine's Link International Holdings How Does Wine's Link International Holdings's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?Wine's Link International Holdings's P/E of 6.00 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. The image below shows that Wine's Link International Holdings has a lower P/E than the average (11.9) P/E for companies in the retail distributors industry.SEHK:8509 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 9th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Wine's Link International Holdings shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Wine's Link International Holdings's earnings per share fell by 6.3% in the last twelve months. But it has grown its earnings per share by 71% per year over the last three years.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does Wine's Link International Holdings's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Wine's Link International Holdings has net debt worth a very significant 193% of its market capitalization. This level of debt justifies a relatively low P/E, so remain cognizant of the debt, if you're comparing it to other stocks.The Verdict On Wine's Link International Holdings's P/E RatioWine's Link International Holdings has a P/E of 6.0. That's below the average in the HK market, which is 10.6. When you consider that the company has significant debt, and didn't grow EPS last year, it isn't surprising that the market has muted expectations. What we know for sure is that investors are becoming less uncomfortable about Wine's Link International Holdings's prospects, since they have pushed its P/E ratio from 4.6 to 6.0 over the last month. If you like to buy stocks that could be turnaround opportunities, then this one might be a candidate; but if you're more sensitive to price, then you may feel the opportunity has passed.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
