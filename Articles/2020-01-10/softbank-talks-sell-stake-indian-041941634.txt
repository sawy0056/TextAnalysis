"There is absolutely no plan to exit from the business."The report of the stake-sale talks comes as SoftBank faces renewed investor scrutiny after being forced to bail out one of its best known portfolio companies, the cash-burning, office-sharing firm WeWork, for about $10 billion last year.This has put a spotlight on founder Masayoshi Son's strategy of pouring billions of dollars into unproven, money-losing startups at a time when it is getting squeezed by a sell-off in many of its listed bets.Its bailout effort for WeWork appeared to have complicated after talks to secure $3 billion from Japan's three biggest banks stalled, Reuters reported last month.The ET report said SoftBank was looking at a partner that can provide equity commitments of $1.5 billion to $2 billion to execute and complete a pipeline of 7 gigawatts of renewable energy projects around the world.SoftBank's Indian clean energy venture won its first solar plant order in 2015, the year when India, the world's third-largest carbon emitter, set an ambitious target to ramp up solar power capacity by five times to 100,000 megawatts by 2022.(Reporting by Sachin Ravikumar; Editing by Arun Koyyur)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLatin America roundup: SoftBank adds $1B, Stori raises $10M and Grow Mobility puts on the brakesTechCrunchRenewable energy finally takes off, as big money enters the industryMarketWatchClimate Fears About Cloud Computing Have Been Vastly OverstatedBloombergDoorDash Files Paperwork for Initial Public OfferingBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
