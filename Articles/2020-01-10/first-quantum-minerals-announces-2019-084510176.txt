("First Quantum" or the "Company") (FM.TO) today announced preliminary production for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, and guidance for production, capital expenditure and costs for the years 2020 to 2022.2019 PRELIMINARY PRODUCTIONThe Company achieved its highest ever annual copper production of 702,000 tonnes, an increase of 96kt from 2018 production. Copper production in Q4 2019 was 204kt compared to 158kt in the same quarter in 2018.Cobre Panama’s final mill (8th mill), came on line in mid-December, providing additional capacity on the third milling train.  Mill throughput can now ramp-up to annualized production of 85 million tonnes.  Mill throughput for the month of December was 6.6 million tonnes. Production for Q4 2019 was 60kt with 25kt produced in the month of December.Kansanshi copper production for the fourth quarter was in line with the comparable period of 2018 though, as noted in Q2 and Q3 2019, lower oxide ore grades and resulting recoveries contributed to lower copper production for the year compared with 2018.Sentinel copper production for the fourth quarter reflects lower feed grades and lower recoveries due to transitional ore mined from the east cutback of the pit which resulted in lower production compared with the comparable period of 2018.Amounts are preliminary and subject to final adjustment. The final production figures will be provided in the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019. 000’s
