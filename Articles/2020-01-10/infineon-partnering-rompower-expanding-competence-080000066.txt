These USB-PD chargers (Power Delivery) with the universal USB-C connector enable the power supply of e.g. monitors or smart speakers as well as charging of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. Today, these plugs already perform other functions, such as fast charging smartphones. Using the USB-PD technology, smartphones can be fully charged in less than an hour.LogoMoreThe next development stage for all these functions will be to install permanent USB-PD wall outlets. With a maximum power output of 100 W made possible by the USB-PD standard, the outlets not only support fast charging of mobile devices, but also function as adapters. In the medium term, USB-PD charging sockets will be common in public buildings, such as airports and hotels, as well as in private homes. This will reduce the runaway growth of portable adapters and chargers.Within the partnership, Infineon will contribute its semiconductor expertise, Rompower will offer its technologies and international know-how in the system area as well as in the construction of compact, small and highly efficient charging solutions. The first step is the development of system solutions for compact fast chargers for smartphones and USB-PD wall outlets.  About RompowerRompower Energy Systems Inc. was incorporated in 1994 in Tucson Arizona and is an internationally recognized research and development company in the field of power conversion.
