Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Qinhuangdao Port:0.066 = CN¥1.5b ÷ (CN¥26b - CN¥3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)So, Qinhuangdao Port has an ROCE of 6.6%.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. If Qinhuangdao Port is cyclical, it could make sense to check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.How Qinhuangdao Port's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCELiabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Qinhuangdao Port has total assets of CN¥26b and current liabilities of CN¥3.8b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 15% of its total assets. This is a modest level of current liabilities, which would only have a small effect on ROCE.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Qinhuangdao Port's ROCEIf Qinhuangdao Port continues to earn an uninspiring ROCE, there may be better places to invest.
