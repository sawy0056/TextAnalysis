(KLDO), a clinical-stage healthcare company with a chemistry-driven approach to leveraging the microbiome organ to treat disease and improve human health, today announced the initiation of a research collaboration with Janssen’s World Without Disease Accelerator*, part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. The collaboration will explore the potential for Kaleido’s Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMT™) to prevent the onset of childhood allergy and other atopic, immune and metabolic conditions by driving specific microbiome features which support an appropriate maturation of the infant immune system. The agreement was facilitated by Johnson & Johnson Innovation.A primary focus of the research will be to utilize Kaleido’s proprietary ex vivo screening platform to identify MMTs candidates that support the growth of specific beneficial microbes. These MMTs will then be further evaluated for their ability to prevent atopic conditions such as infant allergy.“Research has shown the microbiome has the potential to impact a broad range of diseases, so the ability of our MMTs to drive the composition and function of the gut resident microbes could hold significant promise for improving health,” said Johan van Hylckama Vlieg, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Kaleido. “We are excited to apply our platform and extend our research in microbiome-driven immune modulation into infant health together with Janssen. This program will build on and deepen our understanding of how MMTs promote the growth of beneficial microbes driving the gut ecosystem to support immune homeostasis and reduce the risk of onset for allergies and other health conditions.”About Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMT™) Kaleido’s Microbiome Metabolic Therapies, or MMTs, are designed to drive the function and distribution of the microbiome organ’s existing microbes in order to decrease or increase the production of metabolites, or to advantage or disadvantage certain bacteria in the microbiome community. The Company’s initial MMT candidates are targeted glycans that are orally administered, have limited systemic exposure, and are selectively metabolized by enzymes in the microbiome.  Kaleido utilizes its human-centric discovery and development platform to study MMTs in microbiome samples in an ex vivo setting, followed by advancing MMT candidates rapidly into clinical studies in healthy subjects and patients. These human clinical studies are conducted under regulations supporting research with food, evaluating safety, tolerability and potential markers of effect. For MMT candidates that are further developed as therapeutics, the Company conducts clinical trials under an Investigational New Drug (IND) or regulatory equivalent outside the U.S., and in Phase 2 or later development.
