But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers So we wouldn't blame long term StealthGas Inc. (NASDAQ:GASS) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 39% over a half decade. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 8.2% in thirty days. See our latest analysis for StealthGas StealthGas isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.Over five years, StealthGas grew its revenue at 4.2% per year. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. Given the weak growth, the share price fall of 9.4% isn't particularly surprising. The key question is whether the company can make it to profitability, and beyond, without trouble. It could be worth putting it on your watchlist and revisiting when it makes its maiden profit.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NasdaqGS:GASS Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreIf you are thinking of buying or selling StealthGas stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveStealthGas shareholders gained a total return of 16% during the year.
