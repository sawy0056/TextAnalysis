Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Sandfire Resources:0.23 = AU$152m ÷ (AU$736m - AU$62m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Sandfire Resources has an ROCE of 23%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Given the industry it operates in, Sandfire Resources could be considered cyclical.

Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Sandfire Resources has total assets of AU$736m and current liabilities of AU$62m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 8.5% of its total assets. Modest current liabilities are not boosting Sandfire Resources's very nice ROCE.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Sandfire Resources's ROCEThis should mark the company as worthy of further investigation.
