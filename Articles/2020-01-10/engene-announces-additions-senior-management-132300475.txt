The dually derived chitosan (DDX®) platform has a high-degree of payload flexibility including DNA and various forms of RNA (siRNA, shRNA, lncRNA etc.) with broad tissue and disease applications. In addition to developing gene therapies for mucosal tissues such as the bladder, enGene has developed a unique gut-optimized gene delivery formulation into an orally available Gene Pill™ to provide oral delivery of a wide range of protein drugs. Oral gene delivery is a revolutionary improvement over current protein-drug delivery methods which involve injections and represent risks of side effects, high cost, poor patient compliance and systemic problems due to the need to administer higher doses. The company is evolving its technology to enable treatments of all mucosal tissues such as the lung and eye among others. www.engene.com/CisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/engene-announces-additions-to-senior-management-team-300984159.htmlSOURCE enGeneReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCoronavirus Infects Wall Street — Can Gilead, Moderna Ride To The Rescue?Investor's Business DailyWhy This Small Gene Therapy Player Rocketed On A Biogen DealInvestor's Business DailyOtonomy (OTIC) Reports Q4 Loss, Misses Revenue EstimatesZacksA Rumored Gilead Takeover Offer Sent This Biotech Stock FlyingInvestor's Business DailyCara Therapeutics (CARA) Reports Q4 Loss, Misses Revenue EstimatesZacksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
