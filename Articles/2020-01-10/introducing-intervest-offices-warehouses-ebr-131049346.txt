But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. To wit, the Intervest Offices & Warehouses nv (EBR:INTO) share price is 24% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 15% (not including dividends) in the same period.

The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Intervest Offices & Warehouses's TSR of 25% for the year exceeded its share price return, because it has paid dividends.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Intervest Offices & Warehouses shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 8.0% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times.
