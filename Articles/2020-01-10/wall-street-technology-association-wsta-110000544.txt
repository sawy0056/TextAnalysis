Our panel will provide crucial insights and tested practices that will help participants resolve, or better still avoid altogether, whole hosts of problems."Panel Discussion Overview If you're like most financial firms, you've already made a foray into the cloud. You may be using it for R&D or launched into full-production mode. Nemertes Research marks 2019 as "the year of the cloud:" the year in which more than half of all workloads have moved to the cloud.But how does the shift to cloud affect your design practices? What are the "gotchas" and speed bumps that early adopters encountered?This panel of industry experts will share insight into the practical and operational impact (and benefits) of cloud-native and cloud-first design. We'll share what to do, what not to do, and what to expect in terms of business benefits.Topics covered will include: Cloud True Cost of Ownership: What does it really cost, all-in, to move workloads to the cloud (including networking and storage costs)? How can financial firms factor that into their workload-placement decisions? DevOps for cloud and multicloud Leveraging open API platforms, and API management. What are open APIs, and how can they help? How should financial firms think about deploying API management solutions Cloud migration: What workloads can and should be moved to cloud? What are the best practices for legacy migration? Cloud and cloud security: As the perimeter dissolves, how should cybersecurity practices evolve to embrace the cloud?
