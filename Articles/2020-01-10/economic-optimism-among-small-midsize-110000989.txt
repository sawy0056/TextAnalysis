The mark is up from 85 in the previous quarter, a 7.7% increase, and the survey regained losses from the prior two quarters to end the year at the same favorable level as the beginning of 2019. The mark still trails the optimism business leaders felt at the same time last year when the index registered at 95.4, and the recent peak of 110.3 at the close of 2017. Despite the recovery, just 16% of CEOs expect improved economic conditions in the year ahead, the highest since 25% was recorded in the third quarter of 2018. And still, hiring plans remain strong for the year ahead. 63% of CEOs plan to expand their workforce, up from last quarter's 57% and just below last year's 65%.View photosVistage CEO Confidence Index | Surveying CEOs of Small to Mid-sized Business Since 2003 (PRNewsfoto/Vistage Worldwide, Inc.)More"Needless to say, the economy is heading into an extraordinary year that will start with a Senate impeachment trial and end with an election that will determine a record expansion in federal spending and taxes," said Dr. Richard Curtin, research associate professor at the University of Michigan, who analyzed the data.The rebound in the fourth quarter of 2019 is minimal, but it points toward the expectation that expansion will continue during 2020, even if at a slower pace. 27% of CEOs reported recent gains in economic conditions in Q4 2019, up from last quarter's 21%, but well below the Q4 2018 mark of 44%. Worsening economic conditions are anticipated by 29% of CEOs in the latest survey, down from 39% last quarter and below last year's 33% during the same quarter.Revenue and profit outlooks improved as well with 67% of CEOs expecting increased revenues, up from 61% last quarter and almost matching the 70% recorded in Q4 2018. Profit increases are expected by 57%, a moderate gain from 51% in the prior quarter and below last year's 61%, with just 12% anticipating declines in profit. 44% of CEOs report that their prices will increase. Importantly, price increases could be due to rising costs, including those associated with tariffs and company paid healthcare; 29% have raised prices to mitigate the rising cost of healthcare and 37% said tariffs are negatively impacting their business.  The most recent tariff news about a pending trade deal with China, announced just after the survey concluded, should brighten CEOs' outlooks."The latest Vistage CEO Confidence Index rose for the first time since Q4 2018, suggesting the end of the current business cycle as the economic slowdown slows down," said Joe Galvin, Chief Research Officer for Vistage. "Of the six factors that comprise the Index, five bounced off their Q3 2019 lows. The highlights in Q4 include growing expectations for increased revenues (67%) and increased profits (57%). The direction of the economy is a continued concern, with just 16% of CEOs expecting improved conditions in the year ahead."Survey highlights include:Small Rebound in Prospects for the Economy Revenue and Profit Outlook Hiring Plans Remain Strong Investment Strategies Read the full results and download the infographic.About the Vistage CEO Confidence IndexThe Vistage CEO Confidence Index, established in 2003, is a quarterly survey of small to midsize business CEOs, presidents, and business owners about the U.S. economy.
