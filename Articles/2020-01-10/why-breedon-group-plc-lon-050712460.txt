Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Breedon Group:0.086 = UK£105m ÷ (UK£1.4b - UK£238m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, Breedon Group has an ROCE of 8.6%.

Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Breedon Group has total liabilities of UK£238m and total assets of UK£1.4b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 16% of its total assets. A fairly low level of current liabilities is not influencing the ROCE too much.The Bottom Line On Breedon Group's ROCEStory continuesThis is good to see, and with a sound ROCE, Breedon Group could be worth a closer look.
