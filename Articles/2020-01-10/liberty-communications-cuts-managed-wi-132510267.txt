(CALX) today announced that Liberty Communications is accelerating the journey to the smart home with Calix Professional Services, cutting installation times by as much as 50 percent and dramatically reducing follow-up truck rolls to the delight of their subscribers. The regional communications service provider (CSP) began offering managed Wi-Fi in mid-2018, but when uptake rates trailed industry standards, it recognized a knowledge gap. Calix Professional Services helped accelerate this initiative, working directly with Liberty’s technicians, arming them with best practices for delivering, troubleshooting, and managing advanced Wi-Fi services and helping them refine their own installation processes. Most prominently, the Liberty team learned to leverage the insights of Calix Support Cloud to ensure technicians were properly placing Calix Wi-Fi systems to maximize the subscriber experience.“Calix Professional Services has helped us reduce our installation times tremendously, which translates to a faster payback and improvements to our overall processes,” said Marcus Behnken, plant operations manager for Liberty Communications. “The service more than met our expectations of getting our field installers’ knowledge up to speed and armed our technicians with the best practices on how the Wi-Fi network should perform within a subscriber’s home. No longer will we spend a whole afternoon performing an install only to find out it still does not provide a satisfactory experience. Since we've done the training and are now leveraging Calix Support Cloud, we have virtually eliminated the return visits and dramatically reduced the initial install times.”Liberty Communications offers a complete range of residential and business solutions to two towns, West Liberty and West Branch—both just outside of Iowa City. Internet bundles are available from 50 Mbps to 1 Gbps and can be paired with a managed Wi-Fi solution to maximize the subscriber experience. The wholistic offering and focus on the end user experience are part of Liberty’s multi-year program to bring fiber to all its subscribers. Calix Professional Services is accelerating the time to value of that network investment, helping Liberty ensure connectivity remains consistent in all locations in the home.As part of this engagement, the Liberty team was introduced to the Revenue EDGE, a revolutionary subscriber experience solution that promises to transform CSP business models. This solution integrates the subscriber insights needed (EDGE Insights) with cutting-edge premises systems (EDGE Systems) along with simple tools to manage the experience (EDGE Services) and new subscriber services that can be quickly monetized (EDGE Suites). All of this is supported by a family of professional services and go-to-market programs (EDGE Enablement). Consequently, Liberty is now piloting the EDGE Systems—the GigaSpire, powered by EXOS®—to begin delivering the ultimate in-home connectivity experience with Wi-Fi 6.“We are pleased to help innovative companies like Liberty Communications, who see the immense value of delivering an unparalleled subscriber experience that enables subscribers to take advantage of the most advanced services available,” said Matt Collins, chief marketing officer for Calix. “This subscriber focus also positions Liberty for future business success as it solidifies its relationship with its subscribers. The knowledge and best practices from the Calix Professional Services team also position Liberty to continue expanding the subscriber experience with EDGE Insights and EDGE Systems.”Click here to view a video with more information on Liberty Communications and its use of Calix solutions.
