"This partnership between Koupon and Catalina will bring a whole new level of consumer purchase behavioral understanding and insights to help retailers and brands provide a more personalized shopping experience for C-store buyers.""We're incredibly excited about partnering with Catalina to provide our CPG brand and C-store partners with analytics and actionable shopper insights," said Brad Van Otterloo, Koupon's Chief Executive Officer. "These insights, which span competitive brand purchases, basket composition, price sensitivity, coupon usage and more will help us develop and execute more effective digital promotions and campaigns to drive sales lift for our customers."  The Catalina-Koupon partnership also presents an opportunity to test and measure the interplay and impact of buyer behavior on grocery and C-store channels. Historically, C-store heavy brands have had limited understanding of consumer and household purchasing behaviors across channels. Now, they will have a more holistic view into the massive C-store segment, which should translate into more efficient marketing, sales and even trial."According to NACS, 83% of items purchased in a C-store are consumed within an hour, making C-stores an ideal channel for product trial. Catalina's database will strengthen Koupon's ability to deliver personalized offers at scale through the C-store channel," added Van Otterloo. "The insights we'll provide to retailers and brands will enable them to fine-tune their campaigns to provide only the most relevant offers to the highest-value buyers.""Our partnership with Koupon adds further dimension to our already extensive shopper intelligence database, which has real-time data and years of consumer purchase data," said Dr. Wes Chaar, Catalina's Chief Data & Analytics Officer. "We are excited to enrich the personalization, targeting and cross-channel measurement services we provide to our customers, and strengthen our capacity to reach people wherever they shop, whether it's at a grocery, drug or convenience store."Koupon is the latest in a series of new strategic partnerships Catalina has formed to deepen its data insights, increase reach, and help customers with every stage of media planning, execution and measurement. In recent months, the company has also announced partnerships with companies like LiveRamp and Samba TV.Story continuesAbout CatalinaCatalina is the market leader in buyer intelligence and hyper-personalized in-store and digital media to measurably drive, track and measure sales lift, converting shoppers into loyal buyers for leading CPG retailers and brands.
