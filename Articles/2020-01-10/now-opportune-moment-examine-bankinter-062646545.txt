(BME:BKT)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 9, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosBankinter, S.A. (BME:BKT), operating in the financial services industry based in Spain, saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the BME. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Bankinter’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Bankinter What's the opportunity in Bankinter?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 3.86% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Bankinter today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is €6.33, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, Bankinter has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will Bankinter generate?BME:BKT Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Bankinter, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 4.8%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in BKT’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on BKT, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
