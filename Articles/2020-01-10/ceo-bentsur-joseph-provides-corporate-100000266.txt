By successfully bringing projects to market that were previously thought to be impossible, we have assisted in elevating the Israeli Military's capabilities. Most importantly, and what I am most proud of, is the lives we have saved over the past 30 years.Since inception, we have developed advanced unmanned robotic vehicles that defuse bombs, land mine detection robots, and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for firefighting that can withstand the heat and enter into the fire itself, helping firefighters save lives without putting additional human lives at risk.Our clients are essentially a who's who in the State of Israel: the Army, the Knesset, the Police, the Air Force, the Prime Minister's Office, Israel Railways, and many others. One of our products, the Energy Smart Power Pack, has become standard issue in every Israeli military vehicle.As announced, we have recently begun the expansion of our business to include civilian, non-military markets. Our goal is to leverage our technical expertise, patents, relationships, and our reputation to ignite a further 30 years of growth for A2Z.We are a Grade A authorized vendor for R&D and engineering for the Israeli MoD (Ministry of Defense) and plan to leverage our experience working with extremely requiring clientele to bring our next-generation products to market.As we adapt our military technologies for the civilian markets, our Company vision is to excite and provide great opportunities for our shareholders. Our founding philosophy at A2Z is to save lives and with our upcoming expansion into civilian markets, we hope to save even more lives than all of our past products combined. A byproduct and signal of our success in this endeavour will be our sales and ultimately profits.I look forward to keeping you up-to-date on our progress and sharing significant milestones and developments as we execute our business plan."About A2ZA2Z Technologies Canada Corp. is an innovative technology company based out of Israel, specializing in military technology and expanding into the civilian markets.
