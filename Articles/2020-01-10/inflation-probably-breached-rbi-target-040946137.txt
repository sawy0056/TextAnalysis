While there is some sort of increase in other food prices as well, we don't see that to be extremely alarming," said Aastha Gudwani, India economist at BofA Global Research.But core inflation, which excludes volatile components like food and energy, has declining, highlighting weak underlying demand.Therefore, many economists do not expect the rise in consumer price inflation to prompt any policy move by the central bank at its next meeting, in February."I don't think a hike is something the RBI would be looking at right now, because they also need to see what is happening to growth - that is a big concern right now," said Sakshi Gupta, senior India economist at HDFC Bank.(Polling by Khushboo Mittal and Shaloo Shrivastava, editing by Larry King)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFragile Economic Recovery in India Faces New Risk from VirusBloombergAfter Taming Yields, RBI May Take Another Leaf From ECBBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
