And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Bâloise Holding (VTX:BALN), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Bâloise Holding How Fast Is Bâloise Holding Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). It's no surprise, then, that I like to invest in companies with EPS growth. We can see that in the last three years Bâloise Holding grew its EPS by 9.9% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. I note that Bâloise Holding's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort my analysis of its margins. Bâloise Holding maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 3.8% to CHF8.9b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Bâloise Holding?Are Bâloise Holding Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Bâloise Holding has a market capitalization of CHF8.2b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they hold CHF36m worth of its stock. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 0.4% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Does Bâloise Holding Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Bâloise Holding is that it is growing profits. Just as polish makes silverware pop, the high level of insider ownership enhances my enthusiasm for this growth. That combination appeals to me, for one. So yes, I do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Bâloise Holding by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.Of course, you can do well (sometimes) buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.
