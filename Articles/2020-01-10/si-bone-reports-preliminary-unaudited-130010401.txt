There are potential risks associated with the iFuse Implant System.  It may not be appropriate for all patients and all patients may not benefit.For additional information on the company or the products including risks and benefits, please visit www.si-bone.com.Forward-Looking StatementsThe preliminary unaudited financial results, and statements regarding SI-BONE's continued growth and financial outlook, contained in this press release are "forward-looking" statements.
