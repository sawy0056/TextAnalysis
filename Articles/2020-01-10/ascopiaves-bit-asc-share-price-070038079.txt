But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. Long term Ascopiave S.p.A. (BIT:ASC) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 115% in five years. Check out our latest analysis for Ascopiave While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Ascopiave achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 3.8% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 17% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).BIT:ASC Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreWe know that Ascopiave has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Ascopiave, it has a TSR of 198% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Ascopiave shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 31% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 24% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
