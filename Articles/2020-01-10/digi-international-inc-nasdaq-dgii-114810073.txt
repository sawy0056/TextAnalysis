As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Digi International’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Digi International Is Digi International still cheap?According to my relative valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Digi International’s ratio of 49.24x is above its peer average of 20.82x, which suggests the stock is overvalued compared to the Communications industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Digi International’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Digi International look like?NasdaqGS:DGII Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
