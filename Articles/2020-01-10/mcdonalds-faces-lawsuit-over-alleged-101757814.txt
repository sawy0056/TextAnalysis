The situation did not improve after Easterbrook was forced to leave the company over his relationship with an employee, and Chris Kempczinski took over as the CEO in November 2019.  "The disproportionate loss of nearly one-third of the African American franchisees in the Easterbrook and Kempczinski era was intentional or, in the alternative, it was in reckless disregard of plainly foreseeable consequences of business decisions," said the two executives in the court documents.  Why It MattersCharges brought against McDonald's on Tuesday’s lawsuit mirrors earlier claims by the company’s black franchisees that they face unequal treatment within the company.Last year, McDonald's black franchisees claimed their stores earn $68000 less a month versus McDonald's overall franchisee average.Earlier in 2019, the head of National Black McDonald's Owners Association (NBMOA), McDonald's black franchisee group, Larry Tripplett, said, “The trajectory of the treatment of African American Owners is moving backwards.”What’s NextMcDonald’s refused to accept the charges of discrimination. “At McDonald’s, our actions are rooted in our belief that a diverse, vibrant, inclusive and respectful company makes us stronger,” said a McDonald’s representative in a statement on Wednesday.Price ActionShares of McDonald’s rose 1.60% to close at $205.91 on Wednesday.0See more from BenzingaGoogle's Travel Site Updated To Provide More InfoMergers, Acquisitions In Japan Could Lose Momentum Amid Global Recession FearsMercedes-Benz, Geely Come Together To Produce 'Intelligent' Electric Vehicles In China© 2020 Benzinga.com.
