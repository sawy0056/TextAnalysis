To keep it practical, we'll show how Interroll Holding AG's (VTX:INRN) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. What is Interroll Holding's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 33.77. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 3.0%. See our latest analysis for Interroll Holding How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Interroll Holding:P/E of 33.77 = CHF2260.00 ÷ CHF66.91 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does Interroll Holding Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. As you can see below, Interroll Holding has a higher P/E than the average company (23.9) in the machinery industry.SWX:INRN Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 9th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Interroll Holding will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Interroll Holding increased earnings per share by a whopping 34% last year. And earnings per share have improved by 27% annually, over the last five years. With that performance, I would expect it to have an above average P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).How Does Interroll Holding's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Interroll Holding has net cash of CHF56m. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.The Bottom Line On Interroll Holding's P/E RatioInterroll Holding's P/E is 33.8 which is above average (20.2) in its market. The excess cash it carries is the gravy on top its fast EPS growth. To us, this is the sort of company that we would expect to carry an above average price tag (relative to earnings).Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
