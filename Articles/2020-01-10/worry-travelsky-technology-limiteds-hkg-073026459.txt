I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.TravelSky Technology's earnings per share were pretty steady over the last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 7.1%.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting TravelSky Technology's P/E?With net cash of CN¥8.9b, TravelSky Technology has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 18% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On TravelSky Technology's P/E RatioTravelSky Technology's P/E is 20.2 which is above average (10.5) in its market. The recent drop in earnings per share might keep value investors away, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
