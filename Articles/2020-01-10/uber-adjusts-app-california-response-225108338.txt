For drivers, the revamp includes an end to flat surge pricing and the ability to quickly see how much they will make on each ride.Critically, drivers won’t get punished for rejecting trips they don’t want to make. Uber included a cautionary note, however, that drivers shouldn’t refuse trips solely to avoid certain neighborhoods as doing so would violate the company’s policy and California law.While the San Francisco-based company announced many of the changes last month, a Wednesday morning email to California riders heralded they were now live and explained that the changes were “due to a new state law.” The labor law, Assembly Bill 5, went into effect a week ago. Uber and Postmates sued the state last week and on Wednesday asked a federal judge in Los Angeles to block the law.Uber, along with Lyft Inc. and DoorDash Inc., is also working to put an initiative on California’s November ballot that would roll back the law while guaranteeing minimum pay of $21 an hour and some benefits for drivers. A group backed by the companies said it began collecting signatures this week for the ballot initiative. It has until June to collect the necessary number to qualify for this year’s election.While Uber has publicly downplayed the impact of A.B. 5, some analysts have said it’s a concern. Prices for California rides could increase as much as 30% as a result of the new law, according to industry estimates.(Updates with legal filing in the fourth paragraph.)--With assistance from Joel Rosenblatt.To contact the reporter on this story: Lizette Chapman in San Francisco at lchapman19@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextToronto Exchange Set to Re-Open After Glitch Forces Early CloseBloombergJPMorgan Joins Rush to Curb Global Travel as Virus SpreadsBloombergIndia Stocks Extend Slide, Heading for Worst Week in Four YearsBloombergBradley's career night lifts Cal past No. 21 Colorado 76-62The Associated PressOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
