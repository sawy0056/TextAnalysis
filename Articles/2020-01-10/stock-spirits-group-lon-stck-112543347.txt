But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at Stock Spirits Group PLC (LON:STCK), which is up 14%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 5.0% (not including dividends). View our latest analysis for Stock Spirits Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Stock Spirits Group was able to grow its EPS at 0.6% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 4.6% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).LSE:STCK Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreWe know that Stock Spirits Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Stock Spirits Group the TSR over the last 3 years was 26%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Stock Spirits Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 1.2% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 18%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 2.2% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.
