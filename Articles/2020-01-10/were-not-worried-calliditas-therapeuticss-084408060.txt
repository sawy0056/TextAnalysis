For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Calliditas Therapeutics (STO:CALTX) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. View our latest analysis for Calliditas Therapeutics How Long Is Calliditas Therapeutics's Cash Runway?A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. As at September 2019, Calliditas Therapeutics had cash of kr805m and no debt. Importantly, its cash burn was kr86m over the trailing twelve months. Therefore, from September 2019 it had 9.4 years of cash runway. While this is only one measure of its cash burn situation, it certainly gives us the impression that holders have nothing to worry about. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.OM:CALTX Historical Debt, January 9th 2020MoreHow Is Calliditas Therapeutics's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?In the last year, Calliditas Therapeutics did book revenue of kr138m, but its revenue from operations was less, at just kr138m. We don't think that's enough operating revenue for us to understand too much from revenue growth rates, since the company is growing off a low base. So we'll focus on the cash burn, today. Even though it doesn't get us excited, the 24% reduction in cash burn year on year does suggest the company can continue operating for quite some time. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at our analyst forecasts for the company.How Easily Can Calliditas Therapeutics Raise Cash?While Calliditas Therapeutics is showing a solid reduction in its cash burn, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).Since it has a market capitalisation of kr3.0b, Calliditas Therapeutics's kr86m in cash burn equates to about 2.9% of its market value. So it could almost certainly just borrow a little to fund another year's growth, or else easily raise the cash by issuing a few shares.Is Calliditas Therapeutics's Cash Burn A Worry?As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Calliditas Therapeutics's cash burn. For example, we think its cash runway suggests that the company is on a good path. And even though its cash burn reduction wasn't quite as impressive, it was still a positive. Taking all the factors in this report into account, we're not at all worried about its cash burn, as the business appears well capitalized to spend as needs be.
