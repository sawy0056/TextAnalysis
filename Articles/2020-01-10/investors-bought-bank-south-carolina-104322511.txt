But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Bank of South Carolina Corporation (NASDAQ:BKSC) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 54% over five years, which is below the market return. But if you include dividends then the return is market-beating. Meanwhile, the last twelve months saw the share price rise 3.4%. View our latest analysis for Bank of South Carolina While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Bank of South Carolina managed to grow its earnings per share at 11% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 9.0% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqCM:BKSC Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Bank of South Carolina's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Bank of South Carolina's TSR for the last 5 years was 82%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveBank of South Carolina shareholders are up 7.5% for the year (even including dividends) . But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 13% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy.
