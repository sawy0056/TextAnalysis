But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. We regret to report that long term Modern Dental Group Limited (HKG:3600) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 45% in three years, versus a market return of about 24%. Check out our latest analysis for Modern Dental Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Although the share price is down over three years, Modern Dental Group actually managed to grow EPS by 2.0% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.After considering the numbers, we'd posit that the the market had higher expectations of EPS growth, three years back. But it's possible a look at other metrics will be enlightening.Revenue is actually up 15% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching Modern Dental Group more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).SEHK:3600 Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at Modern Dental Group's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Modern Dental Group's TSR for the last 3 years was -41%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Modern Dental Group shareholders have gained 16% (in total) over the last year. That's including the dividend. What is absolutely clear is that is far preferable to the dismal 16% average annual loss suffered over the last three years. It could well be that the business has turned around -- or else regained the confidence of investors. Is Modern Dental Group cheap compared to other companies?
