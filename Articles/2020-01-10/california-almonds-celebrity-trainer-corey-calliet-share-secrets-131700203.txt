Photo credit: Corey CallietMoreStarting off the new year, it's easy to set lofty goals for ourselves which can quickly lead to burnout. To ensure that healthy habits stick in 2020 and beyond, California Almonds has teamed up with celebrity body transformer Corey Calliet to unlock the power of nutrition and self-investment. Known for his appearances on E!'s "Revenge Body by Khloe Kardashian" and with more than 10 years of experience in sculpting some of Hollywood's most recognizable celebrity physiques, Calliet is best known for preparing Michael B. Jordan for his lead role in the "Creed" movies. Calliet continues to inspire better health habits in other celebrities including Khloe Kardashian and John Boyega, among countless others.Calliet is an expert in setting realistic, attainable and even enjoyable wellness goals especially when it comes to prioritizing smart and purposeful snacking. Interestingly, even though 44 percent of consumers agree that they plan ahead for snacking throughout the day, according to the survey, only 15 percent of consumers say they pack healthy snacks as part of their wellness routine. With six grams of energizing protein and four grams of filling fiber, Calliet believes almonds are the perfect natural snack to help crunch cravings and meet new health goals. "Maintaining your motivation and planning ahead are two powerful keys to success. My motivation comes from reflecting on where I used to be; realizing I don't want to be the person I was yesterday and always striving to be better," said Calliet. "Whether you're tackling a new fitness class or looking ahead to make healthier decisions, you need to surround yourself with healthy foods to stay energized and on track. Whole almonds are my ideal snack because they're a great source of natural energy that can be stashed in a gym bag or suitcase for munching but I also like to include crushed almonds in my smoothie, and I tend to pick up almond butter when I have a craving for something sweet.""Since so many of us have calendars filled with career, family and personal wellness commitments, it's crucial to have wholesome snacks on hand to stay full and focused through long days," said registered dietitian Maya Feller. Like Calliet, Feller tells her clients challenged by navigating busy schedules that snack prep is key to stay on track while on-the-go. "I recommend almonds because they're a delicious and portable source of important nutrients like protein, fiber and magnesium."You can look forward to smart-snacking inspiration and Calliet's upcoming recipes and tips on creating healthy habits, by visiting www.almonds.com. Calliet will be sharing the same best practices that keep his clients fueled and energized so that they can be the best version of themselves, no matter what the day brings.Story continuesAbout Corey Calliet
