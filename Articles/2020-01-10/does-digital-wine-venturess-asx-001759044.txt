But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. For example, the Digital Wine Ventures Limited (ASX:DW8) share price is up 40% in the last year, clearly besting the market return of around 18% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Note that businesses generally develop over the long term, so the returns over the last year might not reflect a long term trend.

As a result, we think it's unlikely shareholders are paying much attention to current revenue, but rather speculating on growth in the years to come. Investors will be hoping that Digital Wine Ventures can make progress and gain better traction for the business, before it runs low on cash.We think companies that have neither significant revenues nor profits are pretty high risk. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt.Digital Wine Ventures had cash in excess of all liabilities of just AU$501k when it last reported (June 2019). So if it hasn't remedied the situation already, it will almost certainly have to raise more capital soon. Given how low on cash the it got, investors must really like its potential for the share price to be up 132% in the last year .
