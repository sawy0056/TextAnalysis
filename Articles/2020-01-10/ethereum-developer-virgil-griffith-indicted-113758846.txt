The developer is also alleged to have attempted to evade U.S. legal requirements during his actions.The document adds that one or more of the alleged co-conspirators is expected to be brought to New York and arrested.Griffith was arrested on Thanksgiving for allegedly attending a cryptocurrency conference hosted by the North Korean government and sharing his expertise in using cryptocurrency.Related: Ethereum Developer Virgil Griffith to Be Released on Bail to ParentsAccording to a complaint brought against Griffith on Nov. 21, he had sought approval to attend the conference, which was denied. He then traveled to the conference anyway.“Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,” John Demers, an assistant attorney general for national security, said at the time.After the indictment was released, prosecutors requested that Griffith be sent to his parents in Alabama immediately after being released on bond, rather than be allowed to stay in a New York hotel room until his arraignment. They also asked that Griffith not be allowed to keep his passport card while traveling, claiming that this “poses a serious risk” that he may flee the country in a letter.Griffith’s attorneys, Brian Klein and Sean Buckley, responded that they disagreed with the government’s characterizations and “were very surprised” by the letter. It was not immediately clear whether Griffith will be allowed to remain in New York through his arraignment.“Virgil should not have been indicted. We are going to vigorously contest the charge and look forward to getting all the facts in front of the jury at trial,” said Klein in response to the indictment.If found guilty, Griffith faces up to 20 years in jail. The U.S. Attorney’s Office also wants Griffith to forfeit any property or money obtained for his appearance in North Korea.Griffith had served as the head of special projects for the Ethereum Foundation but has been suspended since his arrest, according to a previous report.See the indictment filing below:UPDATE (Jan. 9, 2020 21:15 UTC): This article has been updated with additional information.Related StoriesNorth Korean Hacking Group May Be Behind Malware-Laden Fake Crypto SiteFreedom Fighter or Fool?
