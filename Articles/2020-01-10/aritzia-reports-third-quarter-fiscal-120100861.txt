Comparable sales(1) growth of 5.1% was driven by momentum in the Company's eCommerce business as well as positive performance across the Company's boutique network. Net revenue growth also reflects the addition of three new boutiques and four expanded or repositioned boutiques since the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company's annual warehouse sale occurred in the third quarter last year compared to the second quarter this year. This timing difference had a low single digit negative impact on net revenue growth in the third quarter this year.Story continuesGross profit increased by 14.1% to $119.6 million .

Gross profit margin, excluding the impact of IFRS 16(2), decreased 50 basis points to 42.6% compared to 43.1% in the third quarter last year. The decrease in gross profit margin was due primarily to higher distribution centre costs, the weakening of the Canadian dollar, ongoing higher raw materials costs and the impact from the new tariffs. These factors were partially offset by leverage from occupancy costs and improvements from the Company's ongoing sourcing initiatives. In addition, gross profit margin in the third quarter this year benefitted from the shift in timing of the annual warehouse sale.Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased by 13.2% to $64.0 million . Excluding the impact of IFRS 16(2), SG&A expenses were $64.1 million , an increase of 13.4% or 24.0% of net revenue compared to $56.6 million or 23.3% of net revenue in the third quarter last year.

Normal Course Issuer BidOn July 11, 2019 , the Company announced the commencement of a normal course issuer bid ("NCIB") to purchase and cancel up to 3,624,915 subordinate voting shares over the 12-month period commencing July 16, 2019 and ending July 15 , 2020.  During the 13-week and 39-week periods ended December 1, 2019 , the Company repurchased 32,600 subordinate voting shares for cancellation at an average price of $15.97 per subordinate voting share. During the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 25, 2018 , the Company repurchased 304,180 and 549,880 subordinate voting shares, respectively, for cancellation at an average price of $18.35 and $17.07 , respectively, per subordinate voting share. Adoption of IFRS 16, LeasesThe Company adopted IFRS 16, Leases ("IFRS 16"), replacing IAS 17, Leases ("IAS 17") and related interpretations, using the modified retrospective approach, effective for the annual reporting period beginning on March 4, 2019 . As a result, the Company's results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 reflect lease accounting under IFRS 16. Comparative figures for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 have not been restated and continue to be reported under IAS 17.  The Company's financial reporting is impacted by the adoption of IFRS 16. Certain lease-related expenses previously recorded as occupancy costs are now recorded as depreciation expense for right-of-use assets and as interest expense for related lease liabilities. The depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, while the interest expense declines over the life of the lease, as the liability is paid off.

These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. We use non-IFRS measures including "EBITDA", "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Net Income", "Adjusted Net Income per diluted share", and "gross profit margin". This press release also makes reference to "comparable sales growth", which is a commonly used operating metric in the retail industry but may be calculated differently compared to other retailers. These non-IFRS measures including retail industry metrics are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures including retail industry metrics in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures including retail industry metrics in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. Definitions and reconciliations of non-IFRS measures to the relevant reported measures can be found in our MD&A. Such reconciliations can also be found in this press release under the heading "Selected Consolidated Financial Information".Forward-Looking InformationCertain statements made in this press release may constitute forward-looking information under applicable securities laws. These statements may relate to our future financial outlook and anticipated events or results and include, but are not limited to, expectations regarding our eCommerce investments, boutique network, infrastructure and talent, outlook for our comparable sales growth during the fourth quarter, revenue growth and gross profit margin in fiscal 2020 as further described below, expectations regarding the Company meeting or exceeding its stated fiscal 2021 performance targets, and other statements that are not historical facts. Particularly, information regarding our expectations of future results, targets, performance achievements, prospects or opportunities is forward-looking information. As the context requires, this may include certain targets as disclosed in the prospectus for our initial public offering, which are based on the factors and assumptions, and subject to the risks, as set out therein and herein. Often but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "may", "will", "expect", "believe", "estimate", "plan", "could", "should", "would", "outlook", "forecast", "anticipate", "foresee", "continue" or the negative of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology.Implicit in forward-looking statements in respect of the Company's expectations for fiscal 2020 to deliver low double digit revenue growth, as compared to fiscal 2019, are certain current assumptions, including, among others, comparable sales in the fourth quarter to be in the high single digits, the opening of five new boutiques in the United States comprised of the three new boutiques that already opened in the fiscal year (Hudson Yards in Manhattan, New York and Mall of America in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Cherry Creek in Denver Colorado ) and the two expected to open at the end of the fourth quarter (Houston Galleria in Houston, Texas and the Domain in Austin, Texas ), two pop-up locations already opened in the fiscal year ( Greenwich in Connecticut and Orchard Park in Kelowna, B.C. ), three boutique expansions or repositions in Canada , already opened in the fiscal year (repositioning of the Mapleview boutique in Greater Toronto , the expansion of the Rideau boutique, in Ottawa, Ontario and the repositioning of the Coquitlam Centre boutique, in Greater Vancouver ), gross profit margin is expected to be flat to slightly lower than fiscal 2019 due to ongoing higher raw material costs and the effect of new tariffs from the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China , SG&A to grow faster than revenue, as the Company continues to make strategic investments in technology and infrastructure to support its long term growth, a majority of the investments related to the Company's eCommerce platform improvements, omni-channel capabilities, digital selling tools and data analytics platforms will be expensed in SG&A, incremental SG&A expenses in fiscal 2020 related to these initiatives are expected to total approximately $8 million , with $2 million to $3 million expected to occur in the fourth quarter, net capital expenditures in the range of $40 million to $45 million , assumptions regarding the overall retail environment and currency exchange rates for fiscal 2020. Specifically, we have assumed the following exchange rates for fiscal 2020: USD:CAD = 1:1.33.This forward-looking information and other forward-looking information are based on our opinions, estimates and assumptions in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we currently believe are appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances. Despite a careful process to prepare and review the forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the underlying opinions, estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct. Certain assumptions in respect of the expansion and enhancement of our boutique network; the growth of our eCommerce business; our ability to drive comparable sales growth; our ability to maintain, enhance, and grow our appeal within our addressable market; our ability to drive ongoing development and innovation of our exclusive brands and product categories; our ability to continue directly sourcing from third party mills, trim suppliers and manufacturers for our exclusive brands; our ability to build our international presence; our ability to retain key personnel; our ability to maintain and expand distribution capabilities; our ability to continue investing in infrastructure to support our growth; our ability to obtain and maintain existing financing on acceptable terms; currency exchange and interest rates; the impact of competition; the changes and trends in our industry or the global economy; and the changes in laws, rules, regulations, and global standards are material factors made in preparing forward-looking information and management's expectations.Many factors could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future events or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the factors discussed in the "Risk Factors" section of the Company's annual information form dated May 9, 2019 for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2019 (the "AIF"). A copy of the AIF and the Company's other publicly filed documents can be accessed under the Company's profile on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval ("SEDAR") at www.sedar.com. The Company cautions that the list of risk factors and uncertainties described in the AIF is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect its results. Readers are urged to consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions carefully in evaluating the forward-looking information and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such information. Selected Consolidated Financial Information
