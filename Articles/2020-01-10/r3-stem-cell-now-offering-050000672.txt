The course is incredibly useful and provides a Certificate of Completion for framing, which is also great for one's malpractice carrier.For years, R3 Stem Cell has been the leader for regenerative training with in person workshops. These include Hands On training with real patients and real biologics. For the Online Course, R3 has assembled the best presentations and procedures from the stem cell training course workshops. Providers can receive the education on their own time, 24/7, from anywhere, for only $995.R3 understands that it may be difficult for providers to take time out of their practice for travel and training. Therefore, the content is the same that is experienced at the in person workshops!

Along with the patient procedures, there are also demonstrations on how and why to perform PRP, including a session on how to handle the biologics too. There are presentations as well on patient marketing and conversions too.According to R3 Stem Cell Founder/CEO David Greene, MD, MBA, "Our comprehensive online course is a stellar combination of didactic education and procedure techniques that are immediately useful in practice.
