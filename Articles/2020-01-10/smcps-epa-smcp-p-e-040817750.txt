But unfortunately, the stock is still down by 14% over a quarter. But shareholders may not all be feeling jubilant, since the share price is still down 37% in the last year.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. View our latest analysis for SMCP How Does SMCP's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 17.40 that there is some investor optimism about SMCP. The image below shows that SMCP has a higher P/E than the average (13.1) P/E for companies in the specialty retail industry.ENXTPA:SMCP Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 9th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that SMCP shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.SMCP increased earnings per share by an impressive 23% over the last twelve months. And earnings per share have improved by 21% annually, over the last three years. So one might expect an above average P/E ratio. In contrast, EPS has decreased by 25%, annually, over 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does SMCP's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Net debt is 42% of SMCP's market cap. You'd want to be aware of this fact, but it doesn't bother us.The Bottom Line On SMCP's P/E RatioSMCP's P/E is 17.4 which is about average (18.4) in the FR market. Given it has reasonable debt levels, and grew earnings strongly last year, the P/E indicates the market has doubts this growth can be sustained. Because analysts are predicting more growth in the future, one might have expected to see a higher P/E ratio. You can take a closer look at the fundamentals, here. What is very clear is that the market has become more optimistic about SMCP over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 13.2 back then to 17.4 today. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But the contrarian may see it as a missed opportunity.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
