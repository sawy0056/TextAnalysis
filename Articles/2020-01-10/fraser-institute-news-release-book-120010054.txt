In the 20th century, he was the world’s foremost advocate for economic and personal freedom. Through his writings and media appearances, he educated millions about how markets work (and how governments often fail).He also heavily influenced policymakers.In the United States, he helped broaden educational choice, change the regulatory climate and end military conscription. Worldwide, most central banks now follow policies grounded in Friedman’s insights and recommendations, which have helped make the world richer and people more prosperous.Friedman was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1912. His career began in earnest at the University of Chicago where he did most of his pioneering academic work. His 1962 bestseller Capitalism and Freedom (alongside his regular column in Newsweek magazine) made him a household name, and he won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1976. He died in 2006 at the age of 94. At the time of his death, he was still researching and writing—the Wall Street Journal published his final column the day after he died.At www.essentialfriedman.org, you can download the complete book and individual chapters for free.
