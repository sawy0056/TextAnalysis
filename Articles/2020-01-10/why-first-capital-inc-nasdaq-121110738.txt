If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.First Capital increased earnings per share by an impressive 25% over the last twelve months. And earnings per share have improved by 9.2% annually, over the last five years. With that performance, you might expect an above average P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does First Capital's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?With net cash of US$51m, First Capital has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 21% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On First Capital's P/E RatioFirst Capital trades on a P/E ratio of 23.4, which is above its market average of 18.8.
