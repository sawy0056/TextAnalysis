The footprint of the new sample filter is 1.25 mm x 1.05 mm x 0.3 mm, in-line with competing BAW micro filters that are being used in 4G and 5G mobile devices. These devices include cellular handsets, laptops, tablets and other devices.The Company’s first WLP sample utilizes the Company’s completed and locked 5.2 GHz WiFi filter, with future WLP designs to focus on 5 GHz WiFi and 5G mobile frequencies in the sub-6 GHz bands including n41, n77, n78 and n79. Once qualified in the second half of calendar 2020, the WLP package technology will enable the Company’s XBAW RF filter technology to achieve a form-factor attractive for mobile devices.Jeff Shealy, Founder and CEO of Akoustis, stated, “Working with our packaging partner to develop a WLP technology for our RF filter chips is a significant milestone for Akoustis as we begin to achieve packaged form-factors for our XBAW™ filter solutions suitable for mobile devices. Once fully qualified, we will be positioned to target 5G mobile handset OEMs, tablet and laptop OEMs either directly to OEMs or through RF module partnerships.”Mr. Shealy continued, “We have expanded sampling to one of the world’s largest OEMs, and we look forward to working with partners and customers to develop qualifiable, commercial wafer level packaging moving forward.”The 5.2 GHz filters are designed and manufactured using the Company’s patented XBAW process and manufactured in the Company’s Si-MEMS Wafer Fab located in Canandaigua, NY. The packages have been designed by Akoustis and made using a high-volume manufacturing partner.The New WLP Demonstrator features:High frequency 5.2GHz operationWide bandwidth covering greater than 100 MHzLow insertion loss in filter passbandSingle-ended input/output portsUltra-small form factor allow integration in moduleAkoustis has introduced several new filters over the past twelve months including a 5.6 GHz WiFi filter, a 5.2 GHz WiFi filter, a 4.9 GHz band n79 filter for small cell network infrastructure, a 3.8 GHz filter and five S-Band filters for defense phased-array radar applications, a 3.6 GHz filter for the CBRS infrastructure market and band 25 downlink and uplink filters for LTE infrastructure. The Company is also developing several new filters for the sub-7 GHz bands targeting 5G mobile device, network infrastructure, WiFi CPE and defense markets.About Akoustis Technologies, Inc.Akoustis® (www.akoustis.com) is a high-tech BAW RF filter solutions company that is pioneering next-generation materials science and MEMS wafer manufacturing to address the market requirements for improved RF filters - targeting higher bandwidth, higher operating frequencies and higher output power compared to incumbent polycrystalline BAW technology deployed today. The Company utilizes its proprietary XBAW manufacturing process to produce bulk acoustic wave RF filters for mobile and other wireless markets, which facilitate signal acquisition and accelerate band performance between the antenna and digital back end. Superior performance is driven by the significant advances of high-purity, single-crystal and associated piezoelectric materials and the resonator-filter process technology which drives electro-mechanical coupling and translates to wide filter bandwidth. Akoustis plans to service the fast growing multi-billion-dollar RF filter market using its integrated device manufacturer (IDM) business model. The Company owns and operates a 120,000 sq. ft. ISO-9001:2015 certified commercial wafer-manufacturing facility located in Canandaigua, NY, which includes a class 100 / class 1000 cleanroom facility - tooled for 150-mm diameter wafers - for the design, development, fabrication and packaging of RF filters, MEMS and other semiconductor devices. Akoustis Technologies, Inc. is headquartered in the Piedmont technology corridor near Charlotte, North Carolina.Story continuesForward-Looking StatementsThis document includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended to be covered by the “safe harbor” created by those sections. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans or strategies for the future (including our possible future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential market opportunities and the effects of competition), and the assumptions underlying such statements.
