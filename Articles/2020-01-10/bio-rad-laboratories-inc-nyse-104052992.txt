This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO), by way of a worked example.Bio-Rad Laboratories has a ROE of 7.3%, based on the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn $0.07. See our latest analysis for Bio-Rad Laboratories How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Bio-Rad Laboratories:7.3% = US$377m ÷ US$5.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Signify?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does Bio-Rad Laboratories Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Bio-Rad Laboratories has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Life Sciences industry classification.NYSE:BIO Past Revenue and Net Income, January 9th 2020MoreUnfortunately, that's sub-optimal. We prefer it when the ROE of a company is above the industry average, but it's not the be-all and end-all if it is lower. Nonetheless, it might be wise to check if insiders have been selling.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Combining Bio-Rad Laboratories's Debt And Its 7.3% Return On EquityWhile Bio-Rad Laboratories does have a tiny amount of debt, with debt to equity of just 0.083, we think the use of debt is very modest. Its ROE isn't particularly impressive, but the debt levels are quite modest, so the business probably has some real potential. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company's ability to take advantage of future opportunities.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Story continuesHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
