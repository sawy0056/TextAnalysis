But as Warren Buffett has mused, 'If you've been playing poker for half an hour and you still don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy.' When they buy such story stocks, investors are all too often the patsy.So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Acushnet Holdings (NYSE:GOLF). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. See our latest analysis for Acushnet Holdings How Fast Is Acushnet Holdings Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Acushnet Holdings has grown earnings per share (EPS) like young bamboo after rain; fast, and from a low base. So I don't think the percent growth rate is particularly meaningful. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Over twelve months, Acushnet Holdings increased its EPS from US$1.43 to US$1.52. That amounts to a small improvement of 6.4%.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Acushnet Holdings reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So it is good to see that Acushnet Holdings insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Given insiders own a small fortune of shares, currently valued at US$57m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to make me think that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Does Acushnet Holdings Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Acushnet Holdings is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination sparks joy for me, so I'd consider keeping the company on a watchlist. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth.
