The analysis of several advanced indoor communications technologies and related markets, applications and survey of the industries are presented. Particularly, this report concentrates on:Wireline indoor communications, including:HomePlug AV2 (MIMO)MoCA (2 and 2.5 and 3)HomePNA 3.1 - ITU G.hn-MIMOWireless indoor communications, including:IEEE802.11acIEEE802.11axIEEE802.11adIEEE802.11ayVisible Light Communications (VLC)Such a selection was based on the intention to analyze the most advanced techniques that support multi-Gb/s speeds of transmission together with other latest achievements in indoor wireline/wireless communications. Besides, these techniques are applicable for supporting a wide spectrum of indoor services - from entertainment to Home Area Networks to the broadband Internet.The report shows that wireline indoor communications are evolving towards ITU G.hn-MIMO as a technology that can use all three existing indoor wirings - electrical, phone and coax to achieve the speed of transmission more than 1 Gb/s. These standard developers believe that it can become the universal standard for home/small office networking; though shipments PLC and MoCA equipment expects to be ahead at least till 2020-2021. Altogether, wireline technologies experience severe competition from rapidly developing wireless advanced indoor communications.802.11ac and 802.11ad are two relatively recently introduced WLAN technologies. They are demonstrating WLANs developments towards multi-Gb/s rates and efficient coverage. The major trend in WLAN silicon is towards using tri-band chips - 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 60 GHz bands - all implemented in a single device. Such a trend together with the falling electronics prices and convenience of wireless (vs. wireline) connectivity make 802.11xx a winning technology.The report also addresses next-generation WICT - IEEE802.11ax (5 GHz band) and IEEE802.11ay (mmWave band). They are coming online for wide commercialization in 1-2 years.Visible Light Communications (VLC), which is defined by the ITU as the 5G technology opens additional opportunities for indoor communications. Dual-purpose LED lighting/transmission is an efficient means of communications with the multi-Gb/s speed of transmission and covering offices and homes and similar structures.All above-mentioned technologies with their advantages and issues are analyzed in this report, which addresses corresponding markets and applications as well.The report also includes surveys of 802.11ad, 802.11ay, and VLC related patents (2017-2019).Key Topics Covered1.
