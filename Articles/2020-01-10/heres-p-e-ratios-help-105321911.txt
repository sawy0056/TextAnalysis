(TSE:GDL)Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 9, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosTo the annoyance of some shareholders, Goodfellow (TSE:GDL) shares are down a considerable in the last month. The recent drop has obliterated the annual return, with the share price now down 5.6% over that longer period.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. Check out our latest analysis for Goodfellow Does Goodfellow Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?Goodfellow's P/E is 14.47. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (14.5) for companies in the trade distributors industry is roughly the same as Goodfellow's P/E.TSX:GDL Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 9th 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that Goodfellow shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. I would further inform my view by checking insider buying and selling., among other things.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Goodfellow saw earnings per share decrease by 35% last year. But over the longer term (3 years), earnings per share have increased by 40%. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 15% per year over the last five years. This growth rate might warrant a below average P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does Goodfellow's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Goodfellow has net debt worth a very significant 127% of its market capitalization. This is a relatively high level of debt, so the stock probably deserves a relatively low P/E ratio. Keep that in mind when comparing it to other companies.The Bottom Line On Goodfellow's P/E RatioGoodfellow trades on a P/E ratio of 14.5, which is below the CA market average of 15.7. Given meaningful debt, and a lack of recent growth, the market looks to be extrapolating this recent performance; reflecting low expectations for the future. Given Goodfellow's P/E ratio has declined from 14.5 to 14.5 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is less confident about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
