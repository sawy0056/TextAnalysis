With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc. (NASDAQ:EPAY), by way of a worked example.Over the last twelve months Bottomline Technologies (de) has recorded a ROE of 2.4%. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated $0.02 in profit. View our latest analysis for Bottomline Technologies (de) How Do I Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Bottomline Technologies (de):2.4% = US$9.0m ÷ US$375m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does ROE Mean?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does Bottomline Technologies (de) Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Bottomline Technologies (de) has a lower ROE than the average (12%) in the Software industry classification.NasdaqGS:EPAY Past Revenue and Net Income, January 9th 2020MoreThat's not what we like to see. We prefer it when the ROE of a company is above the industry average, but it's not the be-all and end-all if it is lower. Still, shareholders might want to check if insiders have been selling.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining Bottomline Technologies (de)'s Debt And Its 2.4% Return On EquityAlthough Bottomline Technologies (de) does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.30 is still low. Its ROE is rather low, and it does use some debt, albeit not much. That's not great to see. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.
