This will help offer a reliable store of value and an incentive to join the network for users globally. The second token, Centric Cash, is pegged to the first token and will freely trade on major cryptocurrency exchanges.The exchange between the two tokens is governed by a decentralized smart contract with immutable price blocks, set one year into the future.
