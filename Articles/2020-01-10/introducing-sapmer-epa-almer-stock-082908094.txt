But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in Sapmer SA (EPA:ALMER) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 16%. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 28%. On the other hand, the stock is actually up 10% over three years. The good news is that the stock is up 3.1% in the last week. Check out our latest analysis for Sapmer While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Unhappily, Sapmer had to report a 28% decline in EPS over the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 16% the share price fall. It may have been that the weak EPS was not as bad as some had feared.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).ENXTPA:ALMER Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?Investors should note that there's a difference between Sapmer's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Its history of dividend payouts mean that Sapmer's TSR, which was a 16% drop over the last year, was not as bad as the share price return.A Different PerspectiveSapmer shareholders are down 16% for the year, but the market itself is up 28%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 2.3%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.
