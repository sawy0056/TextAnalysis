(BME:ISUR) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 3 days.

Last year, in total, the company distributed €0.30 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Inmobiliaria del Sur has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current share price of €10.7. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Inmobiliaria del Sur's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Inmobiliaria del Sur has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Inmobiliaria del Sur If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Inmobiliaria del Sur paid out more than half (67%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 11% of its cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see how much of its profit Inmobiliaria del Sur paid out over the last 12 months.BME:ISUR Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MoreHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Inmobiliaria del Sur earnings per share are up 3.3% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Inmobiliaria del Sur has seen its dividend decline 2.3% per annum on average over the past ten years, which is not great to see. Inmobiliaria del Sur is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Inmobiliaria del Sur? While earnings per share growth has been modest, Inmobiliaria del Sur's dividend payouts are around an average level; without a sharp change in earnings we feel that the dividend is likely somewhat sustainable. Pleasingly the company paid out a conservatively low percentage of its free cash flow. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.Story continuesWant to learn more about Inmobiliaria del Sur?
