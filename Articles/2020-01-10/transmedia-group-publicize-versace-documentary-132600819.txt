"In our interviews, we talk about our long-time friendship with Alfredo and the respect we've always had for his creative genius."The film will depict how after Gianni Versace was murdered in Miami, Gianni's sister Donatella Versace took over the company and won a lawsuit against Alfredo barring him from using his last name commercially."I am super enthused to be a part of this powerful story as one of the film's producers and to have it screened on one of AAWIC Signature events is monumental, said Terra Renee, President of African American Women In Cinema.This historic film program will also feature a screening of the popular film short, "The Promise" Directed by Senegalese Director, Fatou Tore' Ndiaye as part of the Senegal Africa Film Community partnership.The event is supported/sponsored by TransMedia, Black Girls Nerds, Rudy's Lounge and Atlanta Magazine Impact International, to name a few.For more information on tickets, sponsorship opportunities and Press and Media Inquiries contact: Adrienne Mazzone at 561-750-9800 x2270 or email, amazzone@transmediagroup.com.CisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/transmedia-group-to-publicize-versace-documentary-film-at-african-american-women-in-cinema-aawic-sundance-edition-special-film-screening-program-300984327.htmlSOURCE TransMedia GroupReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
