For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Graham (NYSE:GHM) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. The first step is to compare its cash burn with its cash reserves, to give us its 'cash runway'. View our latest analysis for Graham Does Graham Have A Long Cash Runway?You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. As at September 2019, Graham had cash of US$74m and no debt. In the last year, its cash burn was US$1.5m. That means it had a cash runway of very many years as of September 2019. Importantly, though, analysts think that Graham will reach cashflow breakeven before then. If that happens, then the length of its cash runway, today, would become a moot point. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.NYSE:GHM Historical Debt, January 9th 2020MoreIs Graham's Revenue Growing?Given that Graham actually had positive free cash flow last year, before burning cash this year, we'll focus on its operating revenue to get a measure of the business trajectory. Regrettably, the company's operating revenue moved in the wrong direction over the last twelve months, declining by 8.2%. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years.How Hard Would It Be For Graham To Raise More Cash For Growth?Since its revenue growth is moving in the wrong direction, Graham shareholders may wish to think ahead to when the company may need to raise more cash. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).Since it has a market capitalisation of US$206m, Graham's US$1.5m in cash burn equates to about 0.7% of its market value. That means it could easily issue a few shares to fund more growth, and might well be in a position to borrow cheaply.So, Should We Worry About Graham's Cash Burn?As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Graham's cash burn. In particular, we think its cash runway stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending. While its falling revenue wasn't great, the other factors mentioned in this article more than make up for weakness on that measure. It's clearly very positive to see that analysts are forecasting the company will break even fairly soon. Taking all the factors in this report into account, we're not at all worried about its cash burn, as the business appears well capitalized to spend as needs be. For us, it's always important to consider risks around cash burn rates. But investors should look at a whole range of factors when researching a new stock. For example, it could be interesting to see how much the Graham CEO receives in total remuneration.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.
