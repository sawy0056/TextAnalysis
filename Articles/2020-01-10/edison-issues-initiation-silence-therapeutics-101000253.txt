Silence has a proprietary platform for developing siRNA therapeutics, the strength of which was highlighted by preclinical development deals with Mallinckrodt and Takeda (details below). The company will also be re-entering the clinic in Q120 with SLN124, its own drug for iron overload. We are initiating with a valuation of £345m or 440p per share.Our initial valuation of £345m or 440p per share is based on a risk-adjusted NPV analysis of the firm's assets and revenue streams and is driven primarily by our valuation of SLN124 (£141m).
