We really hate to see fellow investors lose their hard-earned money. Anyone who held Flotek Industries, Inc. (NYSE:FTK) for five years would be nursing their metaphorical wounds since the share price dropped 89% in that time. And the share price decline continued over the last week, dropping some 12%.While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness. View our latest analysis for Flotek Industries Because Flotek Industries made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.Over half a decade Flotek Industries reduced its trailing twelve month revenue by 19% for each year. That's definitely a weaker result than most pre-profit companies report. So it's not altogether surprising to see the share price down 36% per year in the same time period. We don't think this is a particularly promising picture. Of course, the poor performance could mean the market has been too severe selling down. That can happen.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:FTK Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.A Different PerspectiveFlotek Industries shareholders gained a total return of 23% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 36% endured over half a decade.
