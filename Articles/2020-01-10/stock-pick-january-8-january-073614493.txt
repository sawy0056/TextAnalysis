Last year’s breathtaking December correction was followed by the record-breaking comeback rally. The late October – early November breakout led to another leg higher, as the S&P 500 index broke above the 3,200 mark. But will the rally continue? If the market goes higher, which stocks are going to beat the index? And if it reverses down from here, which stocks are about to outperform on the short side? We will provide stock trading ideas based on our in-depth technical and fundamental analysis, but since the main point of this publication is to provide the top 5 long and top 5 short candidates (our opinion, not an investment advice) for this week, we will focus solely on the technicals. The latter are simply more useful in case of short-term trades. We will assume the following: the stocks will be bought or sold short on the opening of today’s trading session (January 2) and sold or bought back on the closing of the next Tuesday’s trading session (January 7).First, we will take a look at the recent performance by sector. It may show us which sector is likely to perform best in the near future and which sector is likely to lag. Then, we will select our buy and sell stock picks.There are eleven stock market sectors: Energy, Materials, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Financials, Technology, Communications Services, Utilities and Real Estate. They are further divided into industries, but we will just stick with these main sectors of the stock market.Story continuesWe will analyze them and their relative performance by looking at the Select Sector SPDR ETF’s.Let’s start with our first charts (charts courtesy of www.stockcharts.com).View photosView photosThere’s a S&P 500’s 30-minute chart along with market sector indicators for the past month.  The S&P 500 index has gained 3.82% since December 6. The strongest sector was Energy XLE, as it gained 7.72%. The Technology XLK gained 6.92% and the Consumer Discretionary XLY gained 4.65%.On the other hand, the weakest sector was Real Estate XLRE, as it gained just 0.10%. The Consumer Staples XLP gained 0.16% and Materials XLB gained 0.40% in the last 30 days.Based on the above, we decided to choose our stock picks for the next week. We will choose our top 3 long and top 3 short candidates using a contrarian approach, and top 2 long and top 2 short candidates using the trend-following approach:Contrarian approach (betting against the recent trend):• buys: 1 x Real Estate, 1 x Consumer Staples, 1 x Materials • sells: 1 x Energy, 1 x Technology, 1 x Consumer DiscretionaryTrend-following approach: • buys: 1 x Energy, 1 x Technology • sells: 1 x Real Estate, 1 x Consumer StaplesContrarian approachTop 3 Buy CandidatesVTR Ventas, Inc. – Real EstateView photosThe VTR stock remains slightly below its two-month-long downward trend line. It may act as a neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. If the price breaks above the line, we could see short-term advance towards the resistance level of $60-62.COST Costco Wholesale Corp. – Consumer StaplesView photosThe Costco Wholesale Corp. stock continues to trade above the support level of $290. We could see an attempt at breaking above a potential falling wedge pattern. The resistance level is at around $295.ECL Ecolab, Inc. – MaterialsView photosThe stock retraced its mid-December advance and it is back at the support level of its previous consolidation. Therefore we may see an attempt at reversing short-term downtrend here.We hope you enjoyed reading the above free analysis, and we encourage you to read today’s Stock Pick Update – this analysis’ full version.
