The Company has been in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities regarding Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) deficiencies at the Company’s manufacturing subcontractor site that manages the fill and finish operations of the lacutamab clinical vials. Based on these discussions, on December 13, 2019, the Company decided to suspend enrollment of new patients in the TELLOMAK trial, except in Italy where the clinical trial has been suspended.The Company has received the following new regulatory feedback:The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has placed the TELLOMAK trial on partial clinical hold. Currently enrolled patients can continue treatment in the trial due to the high degree of unmet medical need, once patients are re-consented. However, no new patients can enroll in the trial until a new GMP-certified batch is available.UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has agreed for the trial to continue as planned with current available supply.To note, the Company is awaiting final feedback from the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products in France (ANSM).The FDA did not cite any safety issues related to the trial medication. This is consistent with the review conducted by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), which concluded there were no new, unexpected safety issues related to lacutamab, and the product appeared to be well-tolerated among current patients enrolled in the trial. In addition, the IDMC determined it would be acceptable to continue recruiting additional patients in the TELLOMAK trial, if agreed by regulatory agencies.  The Company is working to transfer the lacutamab fill and finish manufacturing to another contract manufacturing organization (CMO). At this stage, it anticipates that a new clinical GMP-certified batch should be available in the second half of 2020. At this point in time, the Company maintains its partial clinical hold guidance globally as it obtains more information from additional regulatory authorities. The Company will provide a further update in due course. About the GMP Deficiency:This situation is related to GMP deficiencies put forward by the Company’s manufacturing subcontractor, Rentschler Fill Solutions GmbH or “RFS” (now known as Impletio Wirkstoffabfüllung GmbH). RFS was granted a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate by the Austrian regulatory agency in August 2018, which was further confirmed in October 2019 after two on-site inspections. In November, RFS unilaterally withdrew the Certificate of Conformity of batches they have produced, including the lacutamab batch currently used in the TELLOMAK trial. RFS also filed for bankruptcy.The Company’s utmost priority is to ensure patient safety. An extensive internal and third-party analysis concluded that there was no evidence that the integrity of the product was questioned.About Lacutamab:Lacutamab (formerly IPH4102) is a first-in-class anti-KIR3DL2 humanized cytotoxicity-inducing antibody, designed for treatment of CTCL, an orphan disease. This group of rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes has a poor prognosis with few therapeutic options at advanced stages.   KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family, expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up to 85% of them with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes, in particular, Sézary syndrome. It has a restricted expression on normal tissues. Lacutamab was granted orphan drug status in the European Union and in the United States for the treatment of CTCL. In January 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Innate Pharma Fast Track designation for lacutamab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. About the TELLOMAK Trial:TELLOMAK is a global, open-label, multi-cohort Phase II clinical trial conducted in the United States and Europe. In this clinical trial, lacutamab is being evaluated alone and in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced t-cell lymphomas (TCL). TELLOMAK was expected to recruit up to 250 patients, with lacutamab evaluated: As a single agent in approximately 60 patients with Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior treatments, including mogamulizumab, As a single agent in approximately 90 patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) who have received at least two prior treatments, and In combination with standard chemotherapy (gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) in approximately 100 patients with peripheral t-cell lymphoma (PTCL) who have received at least one prior treatment.In patients with MF and PTCL, the study is designed to evaluate the benefit of lacutamab according to KIR3DL2 expression. The study comprises two cohorts for each of the two indications, testing lacutamab in KIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing patients.  These cohorts follow a Simon 2-stage design that will terminate if treatment is considered futile. The Sézary syndrome arm of the study could enable the registration of lacutamab in this indication.Story continuesThe primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate. Key secondary measures include incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, quality of life, overall response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a commercial stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s commercial-stage product, Lumoxiti, in-licensed from AstraZeneca in the US, EU and Switzerland, was approved by the FDA in September 2018.
