But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Unfortunately the F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) share price slid 18% over twelve months. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 27%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 5.3% in the last three years. Unhappily, the share price slid 2.3% in the last week.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Unfortunately F5 Networks reported an EPS drop of 3.8% for the last year. The share price decline of 18% is actually more than the EPS drop. Unsurprisingly, given the lack of EPS growth, the market seems to be more cautious about the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).NasdaqGS:FFIV Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on F5 Networks's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveF5 Networks shareholders are down 18% for the year, but the market itself is up 27%.
