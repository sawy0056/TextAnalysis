The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So before you buy or sell NewOcean Energy Holdings Limited (HKG:342), you may well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling.What Is Insider Selling?It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. Check out our latest analysis for NewOcean Energy Holdings NewOcean Energy Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last YearChairman Siu Shum made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for HK$7.5m worth of shares at a price of HK$1.65 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being HK$1.18). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.
