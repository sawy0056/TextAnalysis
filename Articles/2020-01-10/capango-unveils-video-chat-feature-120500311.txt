Bridging the gap between phone and in-person interviews, Capango's latest innovation transforms retail's lengthy hiring process by enabling job seekers to directly engage with recruiters within the mobile app while saving retailers time and money by conducting more in-depth evaluations of candidates at a higher volume than traditional processes.In today's tight labor market, hiring and retaining top talent remains one of the retail industry's biggest challenges. With forward-thinking retailers already hiring for the busy spring season, the ability to accelerate the recruitment process is becoming a major competitive advantage. To fill the vast amount of open retail jobs quickly and efficiently, recruiters must adopt innovative strategies to engage with a rapidly growing mobile-first workforce who increasingly prefer to search and apply for jobs on their mobile device.To help retailers find qualified candidates that best represent their brand in-store, Capango designed a radically new approach to retail recruiting. Once Capango's algorithm has sorted and prioritized the best-fit candidates, recruiters can now arrange video interviews using Capango's latest in-app video chat feature. The new feature allows a deeper connection to job seekers and a better opportunity to evaluate candidates prior to scheduling an in-person interview. Enabled through the mobile app, the group video function supports three-way communication for recruiters to set up video chats and bring hiring managers onto the call for interaction with the job seeker. Additionally, video chat sessions are logged in the seeker's profile to facilitate communication history tracking."Hiring qualified candidates remains a huge hurdle for retailers, yet they continue to rely on dated and tedious recruitment processes that could potentially weed out great candidates, either because of the time it takes from application to hire or flawed ATS systems," said Stefan Midford, president and CEO of Capango. "With Capango, hiring managers can meet the workforce where they are and better understand their unique personality, passions and communication skills, which are essential to providing amazing customers experiences."A highly focused recruiting engine, Capango enables a more qualified and engaged workforce leading to low employee turnover and an increase in sales. Employers can quickly post jobs and widen or narrow their results by selecting which "powers" and "passions" are needed and desired for each role. Through Capango's proprietary matching algorithm, employers can immediately access a funnel of qualified job seekers, with the best candidates located right on top. Job seekers who don't meet the requirements never get the option to apply, eliminating the need for employers to sift through hundreds of unqualified applications. With easy-to-skim profiles, personalized video intros and in-app chat, Capango empowers employers to quickly locate the right hire all through one platform.Capango will unveil its new video chat feature at NRF 2020: Retail's Big Show & Expo in New York City on January 12-14, 2020 at booth #926.
