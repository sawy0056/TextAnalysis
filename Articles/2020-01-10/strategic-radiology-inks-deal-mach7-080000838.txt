"It is a solution that adds value to member groups in that it does not duplicate the significant IT investments our independent member practices have already made. I'm glad we took the time to get this right."SR Connect will link each of the independent member groups through a centrally hosted Mach7 platform. This central hub will allow aggregation and routing of HL7 and DICOM information between the member groups and other affiliated organizations. The SR-Patient Safety Organization and SR's business intelligence arm, Rad-IQ, also will be interfaced to SR Connect.Mach7 was founded in 2007 to solve imaging IT problems and has evolved to deliver a complete enterprise imaging platform for radiology practices, hospitals, and health systems. Mach7's Enterprise Imaging Platform functionality includes vendor neutral archiving and advanced communication workflows for sophisticated image routing and advanced image and data fetching."One of our biggest differentiators is that we look at problems from the enterprise level," said Mike Lampron, CEO, Mach7 Technologies. "While phase one focuses on a specific use case, we look forward to leveraging our enterprise platform to provide flexibility and connectivity between the member groups as SR continues to grow and expand its use cases."SR Connect's first use case will be a blinded peer improvement pilot, and the SR member practices participating in the pilot will be the first to be interfaced to Strategic Radiology's central hub. SR Connect is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2020.About Strategic Radiology Strategic Radiology is a coalition of independent, private radiology practices, representing more than 1,100 radiologists.
