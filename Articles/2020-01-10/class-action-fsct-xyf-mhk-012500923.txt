This practice is known as channel stuffing and was used by Mohawk to hide severely declining demand for conventional flooring products. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements about Mohawk's sales growth and the demand for the Company's conventional flooring products. Defendants also reassured investors about Mohawk's increasing accounts receivable and inventory levels by falsely attributing those increases to external factors like rising raw material costs and inflation. As a result of these misrepresentations, shares of Mohawk's common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period.Story continuesYou have until the lead plaintiff deadlines to request that the court appoint you as lead plaintiff.
