(LON:STCM) Be Part Of Your Dividend Portfolio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 9, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we'll take a closer look at Steppe Cement Ltd. (LON:STCM) from a dividend investor's perspective. Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.With a five-year payment history and a 7.5% yield, many investors probably find Steppe Cement intriguing. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . Remember though, due to the recent spike in its share price, Steppe Cement's yield will look lower, even though the market may now be factoring in an improvement in its long-term prospects. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Steppe Cement for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Steppe Cement! AIM:STCM Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Steppe Cement paid out 71% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Steppe Cement's cash payout ratio last year was 15%, which is quite low and suggests that the dividend was thoroughly covered by cash flow. It's positive to see that Steppe Cement's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.With a strong net cash balance, Steppe Cement investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Steppe Cement's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Steppe Cement has been paying a dividend for the past five years. During the past five-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.029 in 2015, compared to US$0.036 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.3% a year over that time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 4.3% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.It's good to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth, anyway. We're not that enthused by this.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Steppe Cement has grown its earnings per share at 2.5% per annum over the past five years. 2.5% per annum is not a particularly high rate of growth, which we find curious. When a business is not growing, it often makes more sense to pay higher dividends to shareholders rather than retain the cash with no way to utilise it.Story continuesConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, we think Steppe Cement has an acceptable payout ratio and its dividend is well covered by cashflow. Unfortunately, earnings growth has also been mediocre, and the company has cut its dividend at least once in the past. In sum, we find it hard to get excited about Steppe Cement from a dividend perspective. It's not that we think it's a bad business; just that there are other companies that perform better on these criteria.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Steppe Cement stock.
