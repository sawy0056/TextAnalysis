(NYSE:DIN) share price has gained 21% in the last three months. But over the last half decade, the stock has not performed well. After all, the share price is down 19% in that time, significantly under-performing the market. View our latest analysis for Dine Brands Global While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Dine Brands Global actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 7.7% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.It's strange to see such muted share price performance despite sustained growth. Perhaps a clue lies in other metrics.In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 5.5% a year in the five year period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:DIN Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreBalance sheet strength is crucial.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Dine Brands Global's TSR for the last 5 years was 2.4%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveDine Brands Global shareholders gained a total return of 14% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 0.5% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time.
