Here’s what Americans preferShawn M. CarterFox BusinessJanuary 9, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareIf they could only have one, Americans would likely choose coffee over donuts.That’s according to a report from The NPD Group, which gauged adults’ eating habits.Of the 18,000 quick-service donut shops in the country, Americans ordered 2 billion servings of coffee in the year ending October 2019 versus only 805 million donuts.“We are a nation of coffee drinkers and while we like our donuts, too, we tend to be fueled by coffee and drink more of it,” David Portalatin, NPD food industry advisor and author of Eating Patterns in America, said in the statement. “The takeaway for donut shops? If you serve good tasting coffee with your good tasting donuts, consumers will visit.”Only 15 percent of quick-service donut purchases included a coffee-donut combo, in fact. And for donut-shop patrons overall, 68 percent of purchases include just a coffee and 30 percent were donut-only buys. The coffee buyers tend to be “aficionados” too. Specialty drink orders were up 14 percent versus 4 percent for standard coffee, according to the report.FROSTED FLAKES, OREOS FIND A NEW MARKET SHELF LIFE, ANALYSTS SAYThere were more than 3 billion visits to quick-service donut outlets during the time of the survey.
