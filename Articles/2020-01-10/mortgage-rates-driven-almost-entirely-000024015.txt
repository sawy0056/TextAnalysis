A lack of meaningful changes to key data series over the past week means that nearly all of the market's movements were dictated by geopolitical events.Bond yields and mortgage rates fell in the immediate aftermath of escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran, but rebounded somewhat after fears of a larger conflict between the two nations appeared to dissipate slightly (at least for now). Rates generally trended lower throughout the holiday season, with little in the way of sudden movements or notable volatility.But volatility may return in coming days, potentially as soon as Friday's release of December's all-important jobs figures. Should December's numbers come close to November's – which greatly exceeded experts' expectations – and tensions in the Middle East fail to escalate further, a return to upward-trending rates may be on the horizon.The post Mortgage Rates Driven Almost Entirely by U.S./Iran Tensions appeared first on Zillow Research.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNations take drastic measures as coronavirus outbreak spreadsMarketWatchCycling race canceled with 2 virus cases, Froome quarantinedThe Associated PressKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergAt least 7 Iranian government officials have coronavirusThe WeekDonald Trump Must Know This: War Is No Alternative To Dealing With Iran (Still)The National InterestBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
