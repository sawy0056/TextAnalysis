Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.Dermapharm Holding has only been paying a dividend for a year or so, so investors might be curious about its 2.0% yield. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Dermapharm Holding for its dividend, and we'll go through these below. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Dermapharm Holding! XTRA:DMP Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Dermapharm Holding paid out 56% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Dermapharm Holding paid out 81% of its cash flow last year. This may be sustainable but it does not leave much of a buffer for unexpected circumstances. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Is Dermapharm Holding's Balance Sheet Risky?As Dermapharm Holding has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). Dermapharm Holding has net debt of 3.15 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the limit of most investors' comfort zones. Judicious use of debt can enhance shareholder returns, but also adds to the risk if something goes awry.We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 17.83 times its interest expense, Dermapharm Holding's interest cover is quite strong - more than enough to cover the interest expense.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Dermapharm Holding's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. With a payment history of less than 2 years, we think it's a bit too soon to think about living on the income from its dividend. Its most recent annual dividend was €0.77 per share.Story continuesIt's good to see at least some dividend growth. Yet with a relatively short dividend paying history, we wouldn't want to depend on this dividend too heavily.Dividend Growth PotentialThe other half of the dividend investing equation is evaluating whether earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Growing EPS can help maintain or increase the purchasing power of the dividend over the long run. Dermapharm Holding's earnings per share are down -4.2% over the past year. That's not great to see, but there could be a number of reasons for this. Should the decline continue, we would become concerned. Any one year of performance can be misleading for a variety of reasons, so we wouldn't like to form any strong conclusions based on these numbers alone.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Dermapharm Holding's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Dermapharm Holding's is paying out more than half its income as dividends, but at least the dividend is covered by both reported earnings and cashflow. Earnings per share have been falling, and the company has a relatively short dividend history - shorter than we like, anyway. In summary, Dermapharm Holding has a number of shortcomings that we'd find it hard to get past. Things could change, but we think there are likely more attractive alternatives out there.You can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Dermapharm Holding stock.
