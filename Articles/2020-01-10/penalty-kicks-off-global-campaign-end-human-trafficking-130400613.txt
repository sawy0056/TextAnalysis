Text. Save lives!'MIAMI, Jan. 9 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, It's a Penalty launched its eighth global Super Bowl campaign focused on harnessing the power of sport to prevent abuse, exploitation and trafficking. Launched in collaboration with founding partner, A21, It's a Penalty's 2020 campaign is dedicated to educating sports fans and the general public on what classifies as human trafficking and the subsequent penalties tied to those offenses. Knowing that large events, such as the Super Bowl, can lead to increased instances of human trafficking due to an influx of visitors, the campaign aims to inform people not only on how to identify exploitation and trafficking, but also how to take action and report these breaches of freedom.THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEMChildren as young as 12 years old are being sold for sex in the U.S.1 In Miami, there are documented cases of child sex trafficking as young as 13-years old.2 More than 100,000 children are sold for sex in the U.S. each year.3 83% of sex trafficking victims in the U.S. are U.S. citizens.4
Miami has the fourth highest rate of calls per capita made to the National Human Trafficking Hotline in 2017.5
Florida as a state has the third highest rate of human trafficking cases reported.6 "These figures show that trafficking is still a real problem across the globe," said Sarah Carvalho, CEO, It's A Penalty. "This campaign is designed to progress us towards our and our partners' goal to eradicate abuse, exploitation and trafficking globally by 2030 together. We know from previous campaigns just how impactful they can be – including our largest yet in 2018 which reported that 81% of people felt more equipped to report human trafficking and exploitation after being exposed to the campaign."The 2020 campaign is supported by renowned American Football players like Aaron Rodgers, Nick Foles, Ryan Tannehill, Andy Dalton, Charles Harris and Jerome Baker. Each of the high-profile athletes lent their voice to help raise awareness via a 30-second campaign video which will be shown in-flight by American Airlines and British Airways on inbound flights to Miami with a potential to educate 39.2 million people worldwide. The film will also air in the terminals of Miami International Airport for the entire month of January, along with being broadcast on some of the top television networks spanning across sports, news and lifestyle. If viewers suspect they've encountered a case of human trafficking, the campaign video will encourage them to call 305-FIX-STOP or text BEFREE (233733) to make a report.ADDITIONAL CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIESA half-day summit with key stakeholders to launch the 2020 It's a Penalty Campaign on Jan. 9 th at 10 a.m. at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach, featuring a keynote delivered by Attorney General Ashley Moody.

S A PENALTY
It's a Penalty's vision is to build a world in which no-one is vulnerable to abuse, exploitation or trafficking. Since 2014, It's a Penalty has been working to disrupt the fastest growing and second largest criminal industry in the world: human trafficking and exploitation. We believe that prevention is even better than cure. As well as providing people with the tools to protect those who have been exploited or trafficked, It's a Penalty strives to prevent people from becoming victims of exploitation and trafficking in the first place. We believe that collaboration and partnership are essential in order to achieve our aims. It's a Penalty is able to have such incredible impact because of our collaboration with strategic stakeholders, such as high-profile sporting athletes, the travel and tourism industry – including airlines, hotels, and transportation companies – sporting governing bodies/hosting committees, NGOs, governments, and corporates.
