Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Kongsberg Gruppen:0.046 = kr927m ÷ (kr35b - kr15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Kongsberg Gruppen has an ROCE of 4.6%.

Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Kongsberg Gruppen's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCEShort term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.Kongsberg Gruppen has total liabilities of kr15b and total assets of kr35b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 43% of its total assets. Kongsberg Gruppen has a medium level of current liabilities, which would boost its ROCE somewhat.What We Can Learn From Kongsberg Gruppen's ROCEUnfortunately, its ROCE is still uninspiring, and there are potentially more attractive prospects out there.
