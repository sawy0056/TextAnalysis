If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.With a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if TK Group (Holdings) is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. We'd agree the yield does look enticing. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying TK Group (Holdings) for its dividend - read on to learn more. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis SEHK:2283 Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. TK Group (Holdings) paid out 49% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. TK Group (Holdings) paid out 100% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. While TK Group (Holdings)'s dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, free cash flow is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to TK Group (Holdings)'s ability to maintain its dividend.With a strong net cash balance, TK Group (Holdings) investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Consider getting
our latest analysis on TK Group (Holdings)'s financial position here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. TK Group (Holdings) has been paying a dividend for the past six years. It's good to see that TK Group (Holdings) has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. During the past six-year period, the first annual payment was HK$0.018 in 2014, compared to HK$0.20 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 49% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.It's not great to see that the payment has been cut in the past. We're generally more wary of companies that have cut their dividend before, as they tend to perform worse in an economic downturn.Dividend Growth PotentialStory continuesWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? It's good to see TK Group (Holdings) has been growing its earnings per share at 12% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a good rate, and the company is paying less than half its earnings as dividends. We generally think this is an attractive combination, as it permits further reinvestment in the business.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Firstly, the company has a conservative payout ratio, although we'd note that its cashflow in the past year was substantially lower than its reported profit. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, but it was concerning to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Ultimately, TK Group (Holdings) comes up short on our dividend analysis. It's not that we think it is a bad company - just that there are likely more appealing dividend prospects out there on this analysis.Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
