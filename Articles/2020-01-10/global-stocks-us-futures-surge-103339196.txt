No casualties were reported from the incident.Irani leaders, too, have said that the country will not pursue further escalation in the absence of American provocation.Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations told the bloc that it doesn’t seek “escalation or war,” and that its strikes were a “measured and proportionate military response.”Some analysts are doubting whether this will indeed be the end of Iran’s revenge for killing Soleimani, who was often described as Iran’s second most powerful person after Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, The Nikkei Asian Review reported.The experts polled by The Nikkei noted that Iranian hackers are notorious for cyber attacks, and more such attacks could follow as revenge for Soleimani’s death.Nevertheless, fears of immediate armed conflicts seem to have eased.Asia, Europe StocksThis is how stock markets in Asia performed at press time:Japan's Nikkei 225 index was up 2.31% at 23,739.87 and TOPIX traded 1.63% higher.China's Shanghai Composite was up 0.91% at 3,094.88.
