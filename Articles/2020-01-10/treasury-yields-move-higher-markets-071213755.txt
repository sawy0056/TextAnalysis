There were no reports of casualties so far and the attacks did not target oil infrastructure, which is better than feared.”U.S. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to quell any fears that the retaliation resulted in any casualties.““All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq,” Trump tweeted. “Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.”For investors who want to trade Treasury note moves, here are four ETFs to consider: Direxion Daily 7-10 Year Treasury Bull 3X Shares (TYD) : seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300% of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 7-10 Year Bond Index.
