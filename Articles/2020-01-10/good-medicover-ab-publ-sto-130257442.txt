With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Medicover AB (publ) (STO:MCOV B), by way of a worked example.Medicover has a ROE of 7.2%, based on the last twelve months. That means that for every SEK1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated SEK0.07 in profit. See our latest analysis for Medicover How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Medicover:7.2% = €24m ÷ €330m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does Medicover Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Medicover has a similar ROE to the average in the Healthcare industry classification (8.6%).OM:MCOV B Past Revenue and Net Income, January 9th 2020MoreThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. ROE can give us a view about company quality, but many investors also look to other factors, such as whether there are insiders buying shares. I will like Medicover better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining Medicover's Debt And Its 7.2% Return On EquityAlthough Medicover does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.71 is still low. I'm not impressed with its ROE, but the debt levels are not too high, indicating the business has decent prospects. Conservative use of debt to boost returns is usually a good move for shareholders, though it does leave the company more exposed to interest rate rises.In SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
