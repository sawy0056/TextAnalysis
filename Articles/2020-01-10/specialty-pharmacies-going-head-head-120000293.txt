Launching in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut – the program speaks to men and women presently looking at a short list of alternatives available to them in a monopolized pharmaceutical market.Benefiting the under-insured, uninsured, commercially insured, and Medicaid/Medicare patients – Sparta Urology provides affordable pharmaceutical care with a formulary that supports the most commonly prescribed FDA approved medication. Patients pay no more than $30 a month for unlimited access to qualifying urology medications. No prior authorization or pre-approvals required. No patient contract or pre-qualification necessary. And patients receive pharmacy support and FREE delivery of their medication within 24-hours if they so choose.Sparta recognizes that physicians need to take a progressive role in maintaining and promoting the doctor-patient relationship to remain competitive. Doctors consider Sparta their marketing partner in a climate dominated by virtual relationships and internet-based companies popping up like weeds. "I'm very impressed by the professionalism and customer service," says Dr. Elliot Paul of Long Island, who was one of the pioneers in the pilot program launched in July 2019. "This program has the capacity to revolutionize the way we conduct business and the way we serve our patients." Dr. Paul continues to offer his expertise in helping to keep the formulary up to date.Pharmacies have seen an outstanding response from their customers who are faced with a political agenda that doesn't seem to address the critical issues of escalating prescription drug prices. "Anyone waiting for the federal or state government to suddenly wake up and change the rules governing pharmaceutical distribution, management, and accessibility should consider boarding the next ship to Mars – you'll get there faster," says Arkadiy Davydov, Supervising Pharmacist at Pro Pharmacy of Hicksville, NY. "It's a great program and my customers really appreciate having an affordable alternative."Sparta Urology officially launched on Dec. 2, 2019.
