We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. For example, we sympathize with anyone who was caught holding Incus Investor ASA (OB:INC) during the five years that saw its share price drop a whopping 93%. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 24% in the last 90 days.We really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio. Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson. Check out our latest analysis for Incus Investor While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Incus Investor became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.Arguably, the revenue drop of 36% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. That could explain the weak share price.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).OB:INC Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Incus Investor's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Incus Investor's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Dividends have been really beneficial for Incus Investor shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 79%, over the last 5 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Incus Investor shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 19% over the last year. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 27% per year over five years. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes.
