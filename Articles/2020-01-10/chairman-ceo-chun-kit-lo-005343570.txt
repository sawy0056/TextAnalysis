However, we do note that it only increased their holding by 0.1%, and it wasn't a huge purchase by absolute value, either. See our latest analysis for EFT Solutions Holdings EFT Solutions Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent purchase by Chun Kit Lo is the biggest insider purchase of EFT Solutions Holdings shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that even when the share price was higher than HK$0.14 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that EFT Solutions Holdings insiders own 72% of the company, worth about HK$47m.
