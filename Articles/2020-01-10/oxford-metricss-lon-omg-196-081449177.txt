But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is Oxford Metrics plc (LON:OMG) which saw its share price drive 196% higher over five years. On top of that, the share price is up 16% in about a quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 8.4% in 90 days). Check out our latest analysis for Oxford Metrics While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last half decade, Oxford Metrics became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).AIM:OMG Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Oxford Metrics the TSR over the last 5 years was 341%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Oxford Metrics has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 47% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 35% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
