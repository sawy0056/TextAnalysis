If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.In this case, SSE likely looks attractive to investors, given its 6.9% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 1.4% of market capitalisation this year. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying SSE for its dividend - read on to learn more.

If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. SSE paid out 55% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. SSE paid out 1031% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. SSE paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were SSE to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Is SSE's Balance Sheet Risky?As SSE has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). SSE has net debt of 4.10 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the limit of most investors' comfort zones. Judicious use of debt can enhance shareholder returns, but also adds to the risk if something goes awry.We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 4.21 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for SSE, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.We update our data on SSE every 24 hours, so you can always get

SSE has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was UK£0.66 in 2010, compared to UK£0.97 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 4.0% per year over this time.Story continuesSlow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think is seriously impressive.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see SSE has grown its earnings per share at 38% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share are sharply up, but we wonder if paying out more than half its earnings (leaving less for reinvestment) is an implicit signal that SSE's growth will be slower in the future.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, the company has a payout ratio that was within an average range for most dividend stocks, but it paid out virtually all of its generated cash flow. We like that it has been delivering solid improvement in its earnings per share, and relatively consistent dividend payments. In sum, we find it hard to get excited about SSE from a dividend perspective. It's not that we think it's a bad business; just that there are other companies that perform better on these criteria.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
