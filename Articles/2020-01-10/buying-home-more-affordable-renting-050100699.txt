However, there are distinct differences between different places, depending on the size and location from core metro areas," said Todd Teta, chief product officer with ATTOM Data Solutions. "For sure, either buying or renting is a financial stretch or out of reach for individual wage earners throughout most of the country in the current climate. But with interest rates falling, owning a home can still be the more affordable option, even as prices keep rising."Renting more affordable than buying in nation's most populated countiesRenting is more affordable than buying a home in 94, or 69 percent, of the 136 counties in the report that have a population of at least 500,000 or more.Renting is the more affordable option in 36 of the 43 counties with a population of at least 1 million or more (84 percent) — including Los Angeles County, CA;
