Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the CSP Inc. (NASDAQ:CSPI) share price is up 78% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 56% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 40% , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for CSP Because CSP made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.Over the last half decade CSP's revenue has actually been trending down at about 3.1% per year. Despite the lack of revenue growth, the stock has returned a respectable 12%, compound, over that time. It's probably worth checking other factors such as the profitability, to try to understand the share price action. It may not be reflecting the revenue.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGM:CSPI Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreIf you are thinking of buying or selling CSP stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, CSP's TSR for the last 5 years was 131%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that CSP shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 40% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 18%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Keeping this in mind, a solid next step might be to take a look at CSP's dividend track record.
