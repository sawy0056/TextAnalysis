(NASDAQ:FNJN). This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. Third, we'll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. Check out our latest analysis for Finjan Holdings How Does Phil Hartstein's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?Our data indicates that Finjan Holdings, Inc. is worth US$64m, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$2.1m for the year to December 2018. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth noting the salary is lower, valued at US$390k. We further remind readers that the CEO may face performance requirements to receive the non-salary part of the total compensation. We examined a group of similar sized companies, with market capitalizations of below US$200m. The median CEO total compensation in that group is US$523k.It would therefore appear that Finjan Holdings, Inc. pays Phil Hartstein more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn't mean the remuneration is too high.
