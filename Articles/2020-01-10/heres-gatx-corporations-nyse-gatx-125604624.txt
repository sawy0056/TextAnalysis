We'll show how you can use GATX Corporation's (NYSE:GATX) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. What is GATX's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 14.41. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 6.9%. Check out our latest analysis for GATX How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for GATX:P/E of 14.41 = $81.21 ÷ $5.63 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does GATX Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. If you look at the image below, you can see GATX has a lower P/E than the average (17.6) in the trade distributors industry classification.NYSE:GATX Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 9th 2020MoreThis suggests that market participants think GATX will underperform other companies in its industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.GATX shrunk earnings per share by 58% over the last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 5.1%. And over the longer term (3 years) earnings per share have decreased 6.7% annually. This could justify a low P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).How Does GATX's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?GATX's net debt is considerable, at 163% of its market cap. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you must keep in mind that these debt levels would usually warrant a relatively low P/E.The Verdict On GATX's P/E RatioGATX's P/E is 14.4 which is below average (18.8) in the US market. Given meaningful debt, and a lack of recent growth, the market looks to be extrapolating this recent performance; reflecting low expectations for the future.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
