Less-covered, small caps sees more of an opportunity for mispricing due to the lack of information available to the public, which can be a good thing. So, could the stock still be trading at a low price relative to its actual value? Let’s examine LoopUp Group’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for LoopUp Group Is LoopUp Group still cheap?LoopUp Group is currently overpriced based on my relative valuation model. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that LoopUp Group’s ratio of 52.43x is above its peer average of 30.94x, which suggests the stock is overvalued compared to the Software industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that LoopUp Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of LoopUp Group look like?AIM:LOOP Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for LoopUp Group, at least in the near future.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? If you believe LOOP is currently trading above its peers, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to reduce your total portfolio risk. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LOOP for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Price climbed passed its industry peers, in addition to a risky future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
