But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Lycopodium Limited (ASX:LYL) stock is up an impressive 269% over the last five years. See our latest analysis for Lycopodium While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Lycopodium managed to grow its earnings per share at 33% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 30% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:LYL Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreWe know that Lycopodium has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store?

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Lycopodium the TSR over the last 5 years was 353%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveLycopodium's TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 21%. We should note here that the five-year TSR is more impressive, at 35% per year. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes Lycopodium a stock worth watching.
