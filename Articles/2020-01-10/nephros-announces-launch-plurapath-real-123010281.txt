(NEPH), a commercial-stage company that develops and sells high performance water purification products and pathogen detection systems to the medical device and commercial markets, today announced that it has formally launched PluraPathTM, the only commercially available portable water pathogen detection system designed to provide actionable data for infection control teams on up to 15 different pathogens from a single water sample, in approximately one hour.  “In recognition of the large market need and opportunity, we are excited to launch our real-time, portable water pathogen detection system – PluraPathTM,” said Daron Evans, President and CEO of Nephros. “Often finding ourselves present during pathogen outbreaks, we recognized the need for faster, actionable data. Every hour of delay increases patient risk. Additionally, solely focusing on legionella misses additional pathogens that can contribute to making patients sick. Our PluraPathTM system evaluates up to 15 separate pathogens, including legionella, pseudomonas, shigella, salmonella, mycobacterium, E. coli., norovirus and other potentially dangerous bacterial and viral pathogens.”“Initially, we will be working with our strategic distributors to provide capability demonstrations to medical facilities across the country. The combination of rational, regimented pathogen testing, actively managed water disinfection programs, and the risk-based placement of point-of-use filtration provides enhanced protection for patients from the risks and illnesses associated with waterborne pathogens.”The PluraPathTM system uses quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology to provide estimated colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) information to infection control teams on a real-time basis. Each assay has been developed to target specific DNA or RNA segments of the target pathogens. The system leverages Nephros’s proprietary ultrafiltration technology to concentrate the water sample and to decrease the lower limit of detection of pathogens in a 1 liter water sample.Nephros expects real-time data from the PluraPathTM to enable infection control teams to quickly assess potential risks throughout a medical facility, allowing teams to dynamically deploy resources and disinfection efforts during water pathogen outbreaks. Additionally, when used in conjunction with gold-standard lab-based testing methodologies, PluraPathTM can support the routine testing prescribed by each facility’s water management plan.“We are pleased at the performance of our system to detect the presence of pathogens as low as 10 CFU/ml,” said Dr. Kimothy Smith, Vice President of Pathogen Diagnostic Products. “Combined with our unique sample preparation step, we can identify pathogen levels that are below standard action levels for potable water. PluraPath™ will enable our customers to evaluate and monitor the ‘biome’ of their building’s water systems in a way not currently available without significantly greater time and expense. We look forward to working with our authorized Nephros ultrafilter distributors to integrate the PluraPathTM system into their customers’ water management plan activities.”More information, including a white paper about the Nephros PluraPathTM system can be found at www.nephros.com/pathogen.  Please contact your authorized Nephros distributor to schedule an informational webinar or an on-site demonstration of the Nephros PluraPathTM system.About Nephros, Inc.Nephros is a commercial stage company that develops and sells high performance water purification products and pathogen detection systems to the medical device and commercial markets.
