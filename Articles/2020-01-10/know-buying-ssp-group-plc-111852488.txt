Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.With a 1.8% yield and a five-year payment history, investors probably think SSP Group looks like a reliable dividend stock. A 1.8% yield is not inspiring, but the longer payment history has some appeal. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying SSP Group for its dividend - read on to learn more. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis LSE:SSPG Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 42% of SSP Group's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Of the free cash flow it generated last year, SSP Group paid out 48% as dividends, suggesting the dividend is affordable. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Consider getting
our latest analysis on SSP Group's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Looking at the data, we can see that SSP Group has been paying a dividend for the past five years. During the past five-year period, the first annual payment was UK£0.046 in 2015, compared to UK£0.12 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 21% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.SSP Group has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again, but it might be worth considering if the business has turned a corner.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. It's good to see SSP Group has been growing its earnings per share at 38% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share have rocketed in recent times, and we like that the company is retaining more than half of its earnings to reinvest. However, always remember that very few companies can grow at double digit rates forever.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Firstly, we like that SSP Group has low and conservative payout ratios. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. All things considered, SSP Group looks like a strong prospect. At the right valuation, it could be something special.Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.
