Some countries have already kowtowed to Chinese demands, such as not recognizing Taiwan’s independent status. Many others are left with unrealistic levels of debt that they’re unable to repay, such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Montenegro.View photosA loaded truck travels through a newly built tunnel in northern Pakistan's Gojal Valley on September 29, 2015.

Ross also laid out an initiative called the “Blue Dot Network” which would essentially “evaluate and certify nominated infrastructure projects” based on commonly accepted standards. That move aims to address concerns about the sustainability of China’s projects.View photosU.S. President Donald Trump confers with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S. in 2019.

That project appears to be taking on Chinese tech giant Huawei, which is doing something similar as part of the “digital silk road.” “We want to be able to work with our allies on opportunities like this to kind of show that there are alternatives out there,” OPIC COO Edward Burrier told Yahoo Finance. While huge investments like these are “tough projects to do… I know that's something that we'd definitely like to pursue,” he added.DFC, which recently announced that it is is now operational, looks to be a massive boost to American efforts.“In many ways, you can think of us as an investment bank,” Burrier said. “We make investment decisions, we look at the credit and the ability to repay the loans ... we've made money across our portfolio on an annual basis.”When a project they invest in really takes off and creates jobs and spurs development in the destination country, the payoff is even greater, he added: “We want to make sure that our investments are going to be there for the long haul.”View photosPeople take pictures in front of a "Golden Bridge on Silk Road" installation, set up ahead of the Belt and Road Forum, outside the National Convention Centre in Beijing, China May 11, 2017.

Recent examples include Anadarko and AES Corporation investing in big projects in Mozambique and Vietnam, respectively. But since the scale and size of the BRI have been unprecedented, it has been a struggle to match the Chinese.“The USDFC is a very positive step, a powerful instance of U.S. bipartisanship that can hopefully continue and help shape a longer-term strategy for dealing with China,” Jonathan Hillman, senior fellow at CSIS told Yahoo Finance. “The USDFC's impact will hinge on whether it can unlock private sector financing, where the real resources reside.”Nevertheless, it is apparent that the USDFC is an attempt to counter China.China was “very much foremost on the minds of both the administration and Capitol Hill,” Burrier said about the plans. “I really do believe fully that as far as U.S. engagement abroad in this administration, this is going to be a legacy of the administration.”—Aarthi is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
