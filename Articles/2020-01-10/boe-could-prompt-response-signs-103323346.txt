"While carefully circumscribed independence is highly effective in delivering price and financial stability, it cannot deliver lasting prosperity and it cannot address broader societal challenges."($1 = 0.7679 pounds)(Reporting by Andy Bruce and David Milliken; Editing by Hugh Lawson)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFed seen cutting rates amid virus threat, low inflationReutersInvestors in Asia Still Betting Markets Will End Higher in 2020BloombergBank of Canada to stay put for now, but 2020 rate cut in play: Reuters pollReutersGold gives up gains to finish lower for a third straight sessionMarketWatchBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
