While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. To wit, the Liontown Resources Limited (ASX:LTR) share price has soared 1267% over five years. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. It's down 5.7% in the last seven days.It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors. Check out our latest analysis for Liontown Resources With just AU$1,450 worth of revenue in twelve months, we don't think the market considers Liontown Resources to have proven its business plan. So it seems that the investors focused more on what could be, than paying attention to the current revenues (or lack thereof). For example, investors may be hoping that Liontown Resources finds some valuable resources, before it runs out of money.As a general rule, if a company doesn't have much revenue, and it loses money, then it is a high risk investment. There is usually a significant chance that they will need more money for business development, putting them at the mercy of capital markets. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt. Some Liontown Resources investors have already had a taste of the sweet taste stocks like this can leave in the mouth, as they gain popularity and attract speculative capital.Our data indicates that Liontown Resources had AU$532k more in total liabilities than it had cash, when it last reported in June 2019. That makes it extremely high risk, in our view. So the fact that the stock is up 23% per year, over 5 years shows that high risks can lead to high rewards, sometimes. Investors must really like its potential. You can see in the image below, how Liontown Resources's cash levels have changed over time (click to see the values).

However you can take a look at whether insiders have been buying up shares. If they are buying a significant amount of shares, that's certainly a good thing.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Liontown Resources hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of 1359% exceeds its share price return of 1267%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Liontown Resources shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 231% over one year. That's better than the annualised return of 71% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
