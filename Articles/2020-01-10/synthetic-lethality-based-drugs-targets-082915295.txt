Further, several such drugs are being investigated for the treatment of a myriad of advanced oncological and non-oncological indications. A number of companies are engaged in this domain; moreover, both venture capital (VC) firms and government bodies are actively funding such research initiatives.This report features an extensive study of the current market landscape and the future potential of the synthetic lethality-based therapeutics. It features an in-depth analysis, highlighting the capabilities of various companies engaged in this domain.One of the key objectives of the report was to estimate the existing market size and identify the future opportunity for synthetic lethality-based drugs, over the next decade. Based on multiple parameters, such as target consumer segments, region-specific disease prevalence, anticipated adoption of the marketed and late stage drugs and the likely selling price, we have provided informed estimates on the evolution of the market over the period 2019-2030. The report includes potential sales forecast of drugs that are currently marketed or are in late stages of development (phase II and above). The report also features the likely distribution of the current and forecasted opportunity across [A] type of molecules (small molecule and biologic)[B] different target indications (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, fallopian tube cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer and others)[C] synlet targets (APE1 / Ref-1, Chk1, GLS1, PARP, Pol , PP2A and Wee1)[D] route of administration (oral and intravenous)[E] key geographical regions (North America, EU5, Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World) To account for the uncertainties associated with the growth of synthetic lethality-based drugs market and to add robustness to our model, we have provided three market forecast scenarios, namely conservative, base and optimistic scenarios, representing different tracks of the industry's growth.In addition to other elements, the study includes:A detailed assessment of the current market landscape, providing information on drug developer(s) (year of establishment, headquarters and size of the company), phase of development (marketed, clinical, preclinical, and discovery stage) of lead candidates, type of molecule (small molecule and biologic), type of therapy (monotherapy and combination therapy), type of synlet target, target patient segment, key therapeutic area(s), target indication(s), and route of administration. In addition, the chapter includes a list of screening platforms that are being used by industry players to study synlet interactions between gene pairs.Detailed profiles of large players that are engaged in the development of synthetic lethality-based drugs (shortlisted on the basis of phase of development of pipeline products), featuring a brief overview of the company, its financial information (if available), detailed profiles of their respective lead drug candidates, and an informed future outlook. Additionally, each drug profile features information on the type of drug, route of administration, target indications, current status of development and an excerpt on its developmental history. In addition, the chapter includes tabulated profiles of small-sized and mid-sized players (shortlisted on the basis of the number of pipeline products), featuring details on the innovator company (such as location of headquarters, year of establishment, number of employees, and key members of the executive team), recent developments, along with descriptions of their synthetic lethality-based drug candidates.An analysis of the prevalent and emerging trends in this domain, as represented on the social media platform, Twitter, posted during the period 2010-2019 (till May), highlighting the historical trend of tweets, most prolific contributors, frequently discussed synlet targets, popular disease indications and a multivariate tweet benchmark analysis.An analysis of close to 700 peer-reviewed scientific articles related to synthetic lethality, published during the period 2017-2019 (till May), highlighting the research focus within this niche industry segment. It includes an informed opinion on the key trends observed across the aforementioned publications, including information on target disease indications, synlet targets, and analysis based on various relevant parameters, such as study type (review article, research article and case report), research objective, year of publication, key research hubs, most popular authors, provision of grant support, and most popular journals (in terms of number of articles published in the given time period and journal impact factor).An analysis of various abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in the time period 2013-2019 (till May), highlighting several parameters, such as year of (abstract) publication, popular drugs, synlet targets, target cancer indications, popular authors, author designations, industry type (industry and academia) and most active organizations (in terms of number of published abstracts). In addition, this analysis features a multi-dimensional bubble chart analysis to assess the relative level of expertise of the key authors / researchers based on the number of publications, citation count and research gate score.An in-depth analysis of close to 750 grants that have been awarded to research institutes engaged in projects related to synthetic lethality, between 2014 and 2019 (till May), highlighting various important parameters associated with grants, such as year of award, support period, amount awarded, funding institute, administration institute center, funding institute center, funding mechanism, spending categorization, grant type, responsible study section, focus area, type of recipient organization and prominent program officers. It also features a detailed analysis on most popular synlet targets and target indications, along with a multivariate grant attractiveness analysis based on parameters, such as amount awarded, support period, grant type, number of synlet targets and number of indications under study.An analysis of the investments made into companies that have proprietary synthetic lethality-based drugs / screening platforms, including seed financing, venture capital financing, debt financing, grants, capital raised from IPOs and subsequent offerings.An in-depth benchmark analysis of over 230 synlet targets identified from various credible sources (research publications, government fundings, clinical studies, recent news / tweets and abstracts presented in global conferences), highlighting targets that have already been validated in clinical studies, preclinical studies and early-stage research (cases where there is no lead (therapeutic) candidate being investigated). Further, it highlights the long-term opportunities (for drug developers) associated with individual targets, based on their popularity across different portals.An analysis of the role of innovative companion diagnostics in synthetic lethality on the basis of several parameters, such as synlet target, drug candidate(s) being investigated, target biomarker(s), target disease indication(s) and assay technique used. It also includes case studies, highlighting those companion diagnostic tests that are available and are being used to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of approved PARP inhibitors using the principle of synthetic lethality.Key Topics Covered1 PREFACE1.1.
