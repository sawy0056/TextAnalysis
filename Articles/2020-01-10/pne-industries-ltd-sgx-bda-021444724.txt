To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand PNE Industries Ltd (SGX:BDA).PNE Industries has a ROE of 9.7%, based on the last twelve months. That means that for every SGD1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated SGD0.10 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for PNE Industries How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for PNE Industries:9.7% = S$8.1m ÷ S$84m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does ROE Mean?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. A higher profit will lead to a higher ROE. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE.

The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.PNE Industries's Debt And Its 9.7% ROEShareholders will be pleased to learn that PNE Industries has not one iota of net debt! Although I don't find its ROE that impressive, it's worth remembering it achieved these returns without debt.

Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
