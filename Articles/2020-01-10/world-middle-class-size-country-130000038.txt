It is a good proxy to evaluate the potential consumers of goods in different markets.For which industries is this model useful for ? This indicator is particularly relevant in the consumer goods industry to estimate a consumer basis for goods such as large home appliances, high-end consumer electronics, entry level luxury goods etc. It can also be used in the services industry to evaluate potential service users for premium health plans, travel tours, high-end restaurants and so on.World Middle Class Size by Country Methodology Our middle class size estimates are based on the purchasing power of individuals adjusted for income, inequality and country-specific economic conditions.We use a consumption based approach rather than income, first evaluating the number of individuals in each country able to buy big ticket items. We then adjust for country specific conditions that can impact the purchasing power of individuals such as regulations, income inequality... To adjust for these conditions we use a cluster approach. We then benchmark against other countries with similar profiles and correct our initial estimations of middle class size accordingly. We use this method as a more accurate way of sizing the middle class. It takes into consideration the rising consumption of individuals in emerging economies, something a traditional indicator such as the universal income threshold criteria fails to do. Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05838598/?utm_source=PRN About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
