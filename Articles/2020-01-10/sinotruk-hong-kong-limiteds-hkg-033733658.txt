That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation.

That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.So What Does Sinotruk (Hong Kong)'s Balance Sheet Tell Us?With net cash of CN¥16b, Sinotruk (Hong Kong) has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business.
