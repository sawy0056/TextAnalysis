This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Kardex AG (VTX:KARN), by way of a worked example.Over the last twelve months Kardex has recorded a ROE of 28%. Another way to think of that is that for every CHF1 worth of equity in the company, it was able to earn CHF0.28. Check out our latest analysis for Kardex How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Kardex:28% = €42m ÷ €147m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is all the money paid into the company from shareholders, plus any earnings retained. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does Return On Equity Signify?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Kardex Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Kardex has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Machinery industry.SWX:KARN Past Revenue and Net Income, January 9th 2020MoreThat is a good sign. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example, I often check if insiders have been buying shares.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining Kardex's Debt And Its 28% Return On EquityShareholders will be pleased to learn that Kardex has not one iota of net debt! Its high ROE indicates the business is high quality, but the fact that this was achieved without leverage is veritably impressive. After all, with cash on the balance sheet, a company has a lot more optionality in good times and bad.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Story continuesBut note: Kardex may not be the best stock to buy.
