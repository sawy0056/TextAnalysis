(NYSE:BEST) Share Price Tend To Follow The Market?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 9, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosAnyone researching BEST Inc. (NYSE:BEST) might want to consider the historical volatility of the share price. Volatility is considered to be a measure of risk in modern finance theory. Investors may think of volatility as falling into two main categories. The first category is company specific volatility. This can be dealt with by limiting your exposure to any particular stock. The other type, which cannot be diversified away, is the volatility of the entire market. Every stock in the market is exposed to this volatility, which is linked to the fact that stocks prices are correlated in an efficient market.Some stocks mimic the volatility of the market quite closely, while others demonstrate muted, exagerrated or uncorrelated price movements. Beta is a widely used metric to measure a stock's exposure to market risk (volatility). Before we go on, it's worth noting that Warren Buffett pointed out in his 2014 letter to shareholders that 'volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' Having said that, beta can still be rather useful. The first thing to understand about beta is that the beta of the overall market is one. Any stock with a beta of greater than one is considered more volatile than the market, while those with a beta below one are either less volatile or poorly correlated with the market. See our latest analysis for BEST What does BEST's beta value mean to investors?Zooming in on BEST, we see it has a five year beta of 1.31. This is above 1, so historically its share price has been influenced by the broader volatility of the stock market. If this beta value holds true in the future, BEST shares are likely to rise more than the market when the market is going up, but fall faster when the market is going down. Beta is worth considering, but it's also important to consider whether BEST is growing earnings and revenue. You can take a look for yourself, below.NYSE:BEST Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreDoes BEST's size influence the expected beta?BEST is a fairly large company. It has a market capitalisation of US$2.5b, which means it is probably on the radar of most investors. It takes deep pocketed investors to influence the share price of a large company, so it's a little unusual to see companies this size with high beta values. It may be that that this company is more heavily impacted by broader economic factors than most.What this means for you:Since BEST tends to moves up when the market is going up, and down when it's going down, potential investors may wish to reflect on the overall market, when considering the stock.
