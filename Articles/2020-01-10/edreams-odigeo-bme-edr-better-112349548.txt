And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for eDreams ODIGEO:0.11 = €98m ÷ (€1.2b - €322m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, eDreams ODIGEO has an ROCE of 11%.

Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.eDreams ODIGEO has total liabilities of €322m and total assets of €1.2b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 26% of its total assets. A fairly low level of current liabilities is not influencing the ROCE too much.What We Can Learn From eDreams ODIGEO's ROCEOverall, eDreams ODIGEO has a decent ROCE and could be worthy of further research. eDreams ODIGEO shapes up well under this analysis,
