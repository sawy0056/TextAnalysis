Its non-performing loan ratio stood at 1.03 per cent, valued at 4.5 billion yuan.In December, United Overseas Bank (UOB) said it would join hands with Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China Investment Corporation, the country's sovereign wealth fund, to take part in the refinancing of Hengfeng Bank by injecting 100 billion yuan into the troubled lender based in Shandong province.Huijin will inject 60 per cent of the capital while the provincial asset management arm will provide 36 per cent and UOB will put up 1.86 per cent.Hengfeng Bank has not published its accounts since 2016.Its two former chairmen were investigated in 2014 and 2017, separately, before they were charged with corruption involving 750 million yuan and 1.2 billion yuan respectively.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.
