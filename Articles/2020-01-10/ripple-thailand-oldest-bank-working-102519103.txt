You can use your mobile app, scan the QR payment and receive goods right away,” said Arthit Sriumporn, SVP of commercial banking at SCB.Notably, the 112-year old bank already provides cross-border QR payments via Singapore-based payment services firm Liquid Group. It is not clear how Ripple's partnership on the initiative is different. The Block has reached out to Ripple and will update this story if we hear back.SCB’s cross-border payments app, SCB Easy, also runs on Ripple, per Wednesday’s announcement. The app's planned integration with Ripple was first revealed by users on Twitter in May.Sriumporn said Ripple's tech allows users to transfer funds “within 40 seconds" through the app.Looking ahead, SCB is planning to expand Ripple-based services into Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, per the announcement.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextStudents Step Up Protests Against Thailand’s Army-Backed PremierBloombergCoronavirus spread has major champions Lincicome, Lewis fearing for LPGA seasonReutersWyatt hopes Thailand win builds momentum for England ahead of Pakistan clashPA Media: SportEngland delighted to finally ‘put their stamp’ on World Cup, says Lauren WinfieldThe IndependentWinfield: England determined to follow Knight's example after century heroicsYahoo Sport UKBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
