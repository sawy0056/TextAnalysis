Precisely, the de-escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran is likely to help Wall Street maintain its uptrend.Middle-East Tensions De-escalateAfter the recent U.S. airstrike killed Iran’s top commander General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, Tehran retaliated by firing more than a dozen ballistic missiles at U.S. troops in Iraq. Although Tehran’s retaliation initially shook the global market, Trump’s comment has calmed investors.Trump said that the retaliatory attack hasn’t hurt American troops and that the United States will thus not take any military action.Easing Trade WarLast December, Washington and Beijing agreed to the terms of a historic phase-one trade deal — likely to be signed on Jan 15, 2020. As part of the accord, the United States called off the Dec 15 implementation of 15% tariffs on $160 billion worth of China goods — comprising toys, laptops, cell phones and clothing. Beijing also didn’t proceed with the retaliatory tariffs of 25% on American autos that were set to go into effect on the same day.Moreover, Washington has decided to halve the tariff rate levied on Sep 1 on a list of Chinese goods, worth $120 billion, to 7.5%. However, to leverage negotiations for the second phase in 2020, the United States has kept its 25% duty on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods in place.In the next two years, Beijing will ramp up purchase of goods and services from Washington by at least $200 billion, added U.S. officials. The list of goods to be purchased comprises manufactured goods, agricultural goods and energy. With this, the U.S. officials believe that the country’s $419-billion trade deficit with China will be significantly lowered, which in turn will boost the nation’s GDP.Precisely, Beijing has vowed to step up its purchases of agriculture products from Washington by $32 billion in the next two years. Apart from the agricultural purchases, the agreement covers issues like intellectual property protection and technology transfers.Healthy Labor MarketThe employment in the U.S. nonfarm private sector has picked up with the addition of 202,000 jobs in December — per the ADP National Employment Report — beating the economists’ expectation of 160,000, as polled by Reuters. ADP data also signifies that the American private sector has added the maximum number of jobs in eight months.Apart from the solid job growth in December, ADP has made upward revisions to its November estimates from 67,000 to 124,000, reflecting America’s healthy labour market.5 Growth Stocks to Make MerryWith the broader U.S. stock market rising on hopes of subsiding Middle-East tensions, the upward trend is likely to continue as easing trade tensions and a healthy labor market have been acting as catalysts.
