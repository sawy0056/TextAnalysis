On 31 August 2019, the UK£107m market-cap posted a loss of -UK£8.3m for its most recent financial year. As path to profitability is the topic on TENG’s investors mind, I’ve decided to gauge market sentiment. Below I will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for TENG. See our latest analysis for Ten Lifestyle Group Consensus from the 2 Online Retail analysts is TENG is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2020, before turning a profit of UK£4.5m in 2021. TENG is therefore projected to breakeven around a couple of months from now!

This means that TENG has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden.
