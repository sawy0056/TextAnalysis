To keep it practical, we'll show how Lalique Group SA's (VTX:LLQ) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. What is Lalique Group's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 43.56. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.3%. Check out our latest analysis for Lalique Group How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share (in the reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Lalique Group:P/E of 43.56 = CHF35.39 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, EUR ) ÷ CHF0.81 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each CHF1 the company has earned over the last year. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.How Does Lalique Group's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. As you can see below, Lalique Group has a higher P/E than the average company (22.9) in the personal products industry.SWX:LLQ Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 9th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Lalique Group will outperform other companies in its industry. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Lalique Group's earnings per share fell by 26% in the last twelve months. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 11% per year over the last five years. This growth rate might warrant a below average P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does Lalique Group's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Net debt totals 11% of Lalique Group's market cap. That's enough debt to impact the P/E ratio a little; so keep it in mind if you're comparing it to companies without debt.The Bottom Line On Lalique Group's P/E RatioLalique Group trades on a P/E ratio of 43.6, which is above its market average of 20.2.
