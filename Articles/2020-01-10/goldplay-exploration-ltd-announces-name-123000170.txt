In Q4 2019, we were an advanced exploration company expanding our NI 43-101 resource estimate with a large vision to consolidate/acquire key assets in the Rosario Mining District. Over the last month we have signed two LOIs and are conducting thorough due diligence on two past-producing silver-gold mines and sizeable adjacent exploration packages, comprising a wealth of data and infrastructure. We have seized the recent acquisition opportunities as part of our strategy to become the first company to consolidate the Rosario Mining District. The LOIs are non-binding with respect to most terms nor have definitive agreements yet been negotiated or signed for either transaction. Our mission is to continue creating shareholder value through discovery with low-cost, high-quality acquisitions. Our dedication to increasing the resource estimate at San Marcial remains strong as we move forward with the due diligence process".The name change will be accompanied by a new logo, which will be visible in the coming weeks on the website and other corporate material.About Goldplay Exploration Ltd. Goldplay has successfully consolidated a district-sized portfolio, owning >250 sq. km of mineral concessions in the historic Rosario gold-silver Mining District in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico . Its flagship project, San Marcial, consists of a 1,250-ha land package located south of the La Rastra and Plomosas historic mines. San Marcial is a near-surface, high-grade silver, lead, and zinc open pit amenable project for which a NI 43-101 resource estimate was completed by Goldplay in early 2019. Additionally, high-grade gold was drilled in July 2019 at San Marcial, opening up the potential for further gold success. Goldplay's 100% owned El Habal precious metals project is located 20 km west of the San Marcial Project. It comprises 3,700 hectares and is located 75 km southeast of the modern coastal port of Mazatlán, and 10 km on a paved road from the historic mining town of Rosario, Sinaloa, Mexico .Goldplay's current focus includes expanding its NI 43-101 resource estimate at the San Marcial project, which contains 36Moz Ag Eq (indicated) + 11Moz Ag Eq (Inferred), by defining new high-grade gold and silver targets along the project's 6 km mineralized trend. Goldplay is the first company to perform exploration work at San Marcial in over 10 years. It is a low-risk development stage project, fully exploration permitted and supported by the local communities to carry out all proposed exploration activities. Only 500 m of the 6 km trend has been drilled to date, highlighting the significant potential for further discoveries. The Company has identified 8 high-priority targets along the 6 km trend and is currently drilling two high-priority targets at Faisanes and Nava . Some of these exploration targets consist of old shallow pits, caved shafts and historic shallow underground workings in areas with extensive hydrothermal alteration, hosted by major regional structures in a felsic volcanic environment. Mapping and sampling by Goldplay have revealed evidence of dacite-rhyolite dome structures in a highly prospective geological environment for additional high-grade gold and silver discoveries.Story continuesThe El Habal Project is a drill-stage project. Its oxidized gold mineralized zone outcrops along a series of rolling hills with evidence of historic shallow underground mining along a 6 km-long prospective corridor. The El Habal Project is located near the historic gold-silver Rosario Mine which operated for over 250 years.Goldplay's team has over 30 years of experience with senior roles in exploration, financing, and development in the mining industry, including over ten years of extensive exploration experience in the Rosario Mining District, leading to previous successful discoveries.The NI 43-101 reports for each of the San Marcial and El Habal Projects are available on SEDAR.Disclaimer for Forward-Looking InformationThis press release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on the beliefs of management and reflect the Company's current expectations.
