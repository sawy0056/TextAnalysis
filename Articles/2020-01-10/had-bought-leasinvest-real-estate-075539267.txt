But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. For example, the Leasinvest Real Estate SCA (EBR:LEAS) share price is up 27% in the last year, clearly besting the market return of around 15% (not including dividends). So that should have shareholders smiling. However, the longer term returns haven't been so impressive, with the stock up just 7.3% in the last three years. View our latest analysis for Leasinvest Real Estate To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last year, Leasinvest Real Estate actually saw its earnings per share drop 1.9%.The mild decline in EPS may be a result of the fact that the company is more focused on other aspects of the business, right now. It makes sense to check some of the other fundamental data for an explanation of the share price rise.Absent any improvement, we don't think a thirst for dividends is pushing up the Leasinvest Real Estate's share price. Rather, we'd posit that the revenue increase of 13% might be more meaningful. Revenue growth often does precede earnings growth, so some investors might be willing to forgo profits today because they have their eyes fixed firmly on the future.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).ENXTBR:LEAS Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at Leasinvest Real Estate's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Leasinvest Real Estate's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Leasinvest Real Estate shareholders, and that cash payout contributed to why its TSR of 28%, over the last year, is better than the share price return.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Leasinvest Real Estate has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 28% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 9.1% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.
