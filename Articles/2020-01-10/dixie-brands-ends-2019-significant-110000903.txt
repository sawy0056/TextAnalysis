(CNW Group/Dixie Brands, Inc.)MoreDixie announced its entry into the Michigan cannabis market via a packaging and supply agreement with Choice Labs in February of 2019. Demonstrating real agility and speed to market capability, Dixie launched its award-winning portfolio of branded products the following month, quadrupling the number of available SKU's by the end of April in response to positive reaction from both retailers and consumers. Since launching in February of 2019, Dixie has established itself as a powerhouse brand in the state with over 70% dispensary penetration and demand consistently outstripping supply.Michigan is the second largest medical cannabis market in the country with over 300,000 registered medical cannabis patients driving $30 million in annual retail sales (source: Detroit Free Press, August 19, 2019 ). With the state's roll-out of adult-use regulations in December 2019 , the Michigan legal cannabis market is expected to grow to an estimated $1.5 billion by the end of 2021 (source: MLive, Michigan's Recreational Marijuana Industry Poised to Grow Exponentially in 2020, Dec 26, 2019 ), making it one of the largest and fastest growing cannabis markets in the U.S."Expanding into the great state of Michigan was a priority for Dixie in 2019 and the incredible results we have managed to achieve so quickly are a testament to the strength of our brands and the expertise of both our production and commercial teams," said Chuck Smith , President and CEO, Dixie Brands . "And this is only the beginning! With the approval of recreational use, we expect the market to grow exponentially and Dixie's portfolio is well positioned to expand on its market leading position into 2020 and beyond."With only 21 recreational retail licenses issued to date and approximately 80% of Michigan municipalities not yet embracing adult-use sales, recreational retail sales of over $6.5M in December (source: MLive, December 26, 2019 ) demonstrate the potential scale of a recreational cannabis market in the state.
