Superintendent Linda Lacewell announced in October the agency was reviewing the regime, citing the crypto industry’s evolution since the BitLicense was proposed.Related: Former Bakkt CEO to Help Oversee CFTC in CongressChanges to be considered include a modification to the approval process for listing cryptocurrencies and a model framework for coin listings that exchanges can use.
