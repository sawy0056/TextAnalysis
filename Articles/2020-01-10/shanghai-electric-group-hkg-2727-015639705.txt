So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Shanghai Electric Group Company Limited (HKG:2727) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Shanghai Electric Group What Is Shanghai Electric Group's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2019 Shanghai Electric Group had debt of CN¥34.6b, up from CN¥26.6k in one year. However, it does have CN¥41.7b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of CN¥7.04b.SEHK:2727 Historical Debt, January 9th 2020MoreHow Healthy Is Shanghai Electric Group's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Shanghai Electric Group had liabilities of CN¥150.0b due within 12 months, and liabilities of CN¥25.1b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of CN¥41.7b and CN¥77.0b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by CN¥56.3b.This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of CN¥69.8b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on Shanghai Electric Group's use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Shanghai Electric Group boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!On top of that, Shanghai Electric Group grew its EBIT by 78% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt.

While that may be a result of expenditure for growth, it does make the debt far more risky.Story continuesSumming upAlthough Shanghai Electric Group's balance sheet isn't particularly strong, due to the total liabilities, it is clearly positive to see that it has net cash of CN¥7.04b.
