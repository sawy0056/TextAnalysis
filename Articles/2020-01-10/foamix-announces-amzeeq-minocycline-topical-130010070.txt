Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2019, AMZEEQ is the first topical minocycline to be FDA approved for any condition and represents the company’s first commercial product launch. This new once-daily therapy will be available in retail, community and specialty pharmacies nationwide.The Company also announced that the annual list price of AMZEEQ will be $485 per 30-gram canister. This is a lower price per unit than that of current brand leaders in the acne prescription market, setting AMZEEQ apart in terms of its pricing approach.Foamix employed a team of experts to develop the Company’s approach for engaging commercial insurers to offer the broadest possible access to AMZEEQ for patients and healthcare professionals. The Company will provide copay card assistance for eligible commercially insured patients. An electronic benefit verification tool is also available through the product website, AMZEEQ.com, to assist healthcare professionals and patients to understand their likely insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs.Foamix has also developed a multi-channel tactical marketing plan to reach customers, including a sales force deployment to more than 6,000 acne-treating providers with product samples. Foamix will broadcast a promotional speaker program for relevant health care professionals (“HCPs”) nationally on February 13, 2020 to share AMZEEQ product and prescribing information. In addition, Foamix is deploying a broad range of digital consumer outreach tactics, including product information and a unique unboxing-style “how to use” video designed to be easily understood by an adolescent patient population and based on AMZEEQ’s instructions for use.“Moderate to severe acne is a challenging and burdensome condition of many sufferers. AMZEEQ is now positioned to become an important tool in managing this condition,” said David Domzalski, Chief Executive Officer of Foamix. “We recognize that providers and acne sufferers have been seeking alternatives in acne treatment, and I’m very proud of the program we’ve designed to provide broad awareness and availability of AMZEEQ for physicians and patients.”Minocycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic known for its efficacy in treating moderate to severe acne, has not previously been available as a topical treatment due to its instability in traditional topical formulations. With the development of AMZEEQ, Foamix has leveraged its proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology (MST™) platform to conveniently and effectively deliver minocycline in a foam-based vehicle that maintains the stability of the active ingredient while delivering it directly on the skin.About AMZEEQ™INDICATIONS AND USAGEAMZEEQ™ (minocycline) topical foam, 4% is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in adults and pediatric patients 9 years of age and older.Limitations of Use:  This formulation of minocycline has not been evaluated in the treatment of infections.

It is characterized by both inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) and non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) affecting primarily the face and truncal areas of the body. Acne affects approximately 40 to 50 million people in the U.S. alone, of whom approximately 10 million have moderate to severe disease that may impact self-esteem and quality of life. For most people, acne diminishes over time and tends to disappear or decrease, by age 25. However, some individuals, particularly women, can experience acne much later in life.About Foamix Pharmaceuticals Foamix is a specialty pharmaceutical company working to solve some of today’s most difficult therapeutic challenges in dermatology and beyond. With expertise in topical medicine innovation as a springboard, the Company is working to develop and commercialize solutions that were long thought impossible.
