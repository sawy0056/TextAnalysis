Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.Investors might not know much about Spire Healthcare Group's dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last five years and offers a 2.7% yield. A 2.7% yield is not inspiring, but the longer payment history has some appeal. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Spire Healthcare Group! LSE:SPI Historical Dividend Yield, January 9th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Spire Healthcare Group paid out 93% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. With a payout ratio this high, we'd say its dividend is not well covered by earnings. This may be fine if earnings are growing, but it might not take much of a downturn for the dividend to come under pressure.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Spire Healthcare Group's cash payout ratio in the last year was 31%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's good to see that while Spire Healthcare Group's dividends were not well covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a free cash flow perspective. Still, if the company continues paying out such a high percentage of its profits, the dividend could be at risk if business turns sour.Is Spire Healthcare Group's Balance Sheet Risky?As Spire Healthcare Group's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. Spire Healthcare Group is carrying net debt of 3.21 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the upper limit of our comfort range on a dividend stock that the investor hopes will endure a wide range of economic circumstances.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 1.95 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Spire Healthcare Group, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Spire Healthcare Group's latest financial position,

Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Spire Healthcare Group has been paying a dividend for the past five years. During the past five-year period, the first annual payment was UK£0.018 in 2015, compared to UK£0.038 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 16% per year over this time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 16% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.It's not great to see that the payment has been cut in the past. We're generally more wary of companies that have cut their dividend before, as they tend to perform worse in an economic downturn.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? Spire Healthcare Group's EPS have fallen by approximately 37% per year during the past five years. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and Spire Healthcare Group's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Spire Healthcare Group's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. We're not keen on the fact that Spire Healthcare Group paid out such a high percentage of its income, although its cashflow is in better shape. Earnings per share are down, and Spire Healthcare Group's dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. Overall, Spire Healthcare Group falls short in several key areas here. Unless the investor has strong grounds for an alternative conclusion, we find it hard to get interested in a dividend stock with these characteristics.Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive. Very few businesses see earnings consistently shrink year after year in perpetuity though, and so it might be worth seeing what the 9 analysts we track are forecasting for the future.If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of dividend stocks yielding above 3%.If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
