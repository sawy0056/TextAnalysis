For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed.So should Biomerica (NASDAQ:BMRA) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). The first step is to compare its cash burn with its cash reserves, to give us its 'cash runway'. Check out our latest analysis for Biomerica How Long Is Biomerica's Cash Runway?You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. As at August 2019, Biomerica had cash of US$808k and no debt. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through US$1.6m. So it had a cash runway of approximately 6 months from August 2019. Importantly, the one analyst we see covering the stock thinks that Biomerica will reach cashflow breakeven in 2 years. That means unless the company reduces its cash burn quickly, it may well look to raise more cash. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.NasdaqCM:BMRA Historical Debt, January 9th 2020MoreHow Well Is Biomerica Growing?On balance, we think it's mildly positive that Biomerica trimmed its cash burn by 18% over the last twelve months. But the revenue dip of 5.0% in the same period was a bit concerning. Considering both these factors, we're not particularly excited by its growth profile. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years.How Hard Would It Be For Biomerica To Raise More Cash For Growth?Since Biomerica revenue has been falling, the market will likely be considering how it can raise more cash if need be. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash to drive growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.Biomerica's cash burn of US$1.6m is about 5.4% of its US$30m market capitalisation. Given that is a rather small percentage, it would probably be really easy for the company to fund another year's growth by issuing some new shares to investors, or even by taking out a loan.So, Should We Worry About Biomerica's Cash Burn?Even though its cash runway makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought Biomerica's cash burn relative to its market cap was relatively promising. Shareholders can take heart from the fact that at least one analyst is forecasting it will reach breakeven. While we're the kind of investors who are always a bit concerned about the risks involved with cash burning companies, the metrics we have discussed in this article leave us relatively comfortable about Biomerica's situation. For us, it's always important to consider risks around cash burn rates. But investors should look at a whole range of factors when researching a new stock.
