AGDCX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.ObjectiveAGDCX is part of the High Yield - Bonds section, which is a segment that boasts many possible options. Often referred to as " junk " bonds, High Yield - Bonds funds sit below investment grade, meaning they are at a high default risk compared to their investment grade peers. However, one advantage to junk bonds is that they generally pay out higher yields while posing similar interest rate risks to their investment grade counterparts.History of Fund/ManagerAGDCX finds itself in the AllianceBernstein family, based out of New York, NY. AB High Income Fund C debuted in February of 1994. Since then, AGDCX has accumulated assets of about $641.18 million, according to the most recently available information. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 2.96%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 3.82%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of -31.65%, the standard deviation of AGDCX over the past three years is 4.2%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 5.07% compared to the category average of -24.71%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Bond DurationModified duration is a measure of a given bond's interest rate sensitivity, so when judging how fixed income securities will respond in a shifting rate environment, it is an excellent figure to look at.For investors who think interest rates will rise, this is an important factor to consider. AGDCX has a modified duration of 3.77, which suggests that the fund will decline 3.77% for every hundred-basis-point increase in interest rates.IncomeSince income is, of course, a big reason for purchasing a fixed income security, it is always important to consider the fund's average coupon. This metric takes a look at the average payout by the fund in a given year. For example, this fund's average coupon of 6.72% means that a $10,000 investment should result in a yearly payout of $672.A higher coupon is good for those seeking a strong level of current income, but it could also pose a reinvestment risk if rates are lower in the future when compared to the initial purchase date of the bond.Investors also need to consider risk relative to broad benchmarks, as income is only one part of the bond picture. AGDCX carries a beta of 0.26, meaning that the fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. With this in mind, it has a positive alpha of 1.58, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.RatingsInvestors should also consider a bond's rating, which is a grade ( 'AAA' to 'D' ) given to a bond that indicates its credit quality. With this letter scale in mind, AGDCX 's junk bond component-bonds rated 'BB' or below-is at 61.41%. This means that the fund has an average quality of BBB, and focuses on medium quality securities.ExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, AGDCX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.62% compared to the category average of 0.43%. AGDCX is actually more expensive than its peers when you consider factors like cost.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500, investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $50.Story continuesBottom LineOverall, AB High Income Fund C ( AGDCX ) has a neutral Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, worse downside risk, and higher fees, this fund looks like a somewhat average choice for investors right now.Your research on the High Yield - Bonds segment doesn't have to stop here.
