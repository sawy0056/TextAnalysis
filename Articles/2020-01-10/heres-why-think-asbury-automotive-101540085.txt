Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Asbury Automotive Group (NYSE:ABG).

In comparison, loss making companies act like a sponge for capital - but unlike such a sponge they do not always produce something when squeezed. See our latest analysis for Asbury Automotive Group Asbury Automotive Group's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). It's no surprise, then, that I like to invest in companies with EPS growth. We can see that in the last three years Asbury Automotive Group grew its EPS by 16% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). I note that Asbury Automotive Group's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort my analysis of its margins. While we note Asbury Automotive Group's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 5.0% to US$7.1b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.
