In fact, since 2014, over 3,000 patents were reported to have been filed/granted related to such advanced techniques, indicating the rapid pace of innovation in this domain. Developers of the aforementioned technologies claim that these new techniques offer numerous benefits, including fast and precise cell sorting, reduced sample requirement, improved portability, reduced risk to cell viability, and negligible need for expensive biochemical/magnetic labels.Moreover, they have been shown to be compatible for use across a myriad of applications, including research studies (bacteriology, immunology, stem cell research, and viral titering and infectivity), biomedical diagnostics (circulating tumor cell detection, in vitro fertilization, and non-invasive prenatal diagnosis), biological therapy-related process operations (bio-banking, drug discovery, sample preparation, single-cell sequencing, and tumor cell characterization), and cell-based therapeutics (B- or T-cell immunotherapies). Consequently, these techniques have captured the interest of several stakeholders in the biopharmaceutical industry. It is also worth highlighting that stakeholders in this domain have received significant support from both private and public investors.Amongst other elements, the report features:A detailed assessment of the current market landscape, featuring a comprehensive list of over 220 innovative cell sorters, cell isolation kits, and affiliated consumables and reagents, along with information on their respective specifications (such as size, weight, cell flow rate, cell sort rate, cell analysis rate, cell purity and viability, process time, and operating temperature and pressure), cell sorting technology (acoustophoresis, buoyancy-activated, dielectrophoresis, magnetic levitation, microfluidics, optoelectronics, photoacoustics, traceless affinity, and others), type of cell (animal cells, cancer cells, immune cells, microbial cells, red blood cells / platelets, stem cells, and others), cell separation approach (positive selection, negative selection and depletion), basis for separation (cell morphology and physiology, cell size and density, surface biomarkers, surface charge and adhesion, and others), and end-use / application (research studies, biomedical diagnostics, biological therapy-related process operations, and cell-based therapeutics).An insightful company competitiveness analysis, taking into consideration the supplier power (based on size of employee base and experience in this segment of the industry) and portfolio-related parameters, such as number of products offered, number of target cells, end use(s) / application(s), and key product specification(s).
