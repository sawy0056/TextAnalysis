Yingluck, who is 52, was prime minister from 2011 to 2014, and was found guilty of dereliction of duty in a failed rice subsidy program.(Reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng, Panarat Thepgumpanat and Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Editing by Bernadette Baum)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextStudents Step Up Protests Against Thailand’s Army-Backed PremierBloombergDraft Kings: Auto Club 400RotoworldCoronavirus spread has major champions Lincicome, Lewis fearing for LPGA seasonReutersLeslie Gallin Exits Informa After 10 Years at FN PlatformFootwear NewsKnights' Fleury shuns spotlight, keeps going strongThe Associated PressBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
