NYP Learning Studio -- Aimed at promoting continuous learning and reskilling, the NYP Learning Studio will focus on developing manpower capabilities, enhancing skills and competencies, and improving productivity for the food & hospitality sector."With the accelerated need for countries and regions in Asia to produce enough food in order to sustain rising populations, comes the demand for new and innovative ways to produce food locally, and preferably in an environmental-friendly way. In Asia we have already witnessed some instances of sustainable food production and packaging, and the new FoodTech Zone is therefore designed with the sole purpose of underlining some of the recent innovations and best practices by the industry for our attendees at FHA-Food & Beverage," said Mr. Martyn Cox, Event Director, FHA-Food & Beverage."A great brand should resonate with the ethos of today's modern consumer. Alternative protein, food waste, and environmental sustainability are more than just fads. These are relevant topics modern consumers truly care about, creating potential for tremendous growth in the food tech space," said Mr. Nadim Muzayyin, Analyst at DSG Consumer Partners -- a leading Southeast Asian & Indian consumer focused venture fund. "We are especially excited to be speaking at the Food Innovation Theatre and participating in the pitching panel at the FoodTech 4.0 pavilion at FHA-Food & Beverage.
