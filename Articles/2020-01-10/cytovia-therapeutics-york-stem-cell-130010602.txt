(Cytovia) to develop new disease treatments that leverage human stem cell research and novel gene editing techniques. NYSCF will be a key partner to Cytovia in using stem cells to advance novel therapeutic targets for cancer.Cytovia leverages NK cells to make these novel therapeutics more specific to cancer cells. NK – or ‘natural killer’ – cells are immune cells that scan the body and attack infected or abnormal cells, often serving as a first line of defense against cancer. CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) NK cells are genetically engineered to better locate and attack tumors. CAR NK-based treatments are currently showing promise in clinical trials and could serve as a potent and cost-efficient alternative to current immunotherapies. Establishing high-quality, stem-cell-derived NKs and CAR NKs will help improve these treatments and accelerate their path to the clinic.The NYSCF Research Institute is a pioneer and acknowledged leader in stem cell technology, having developed the NYSCF Global Stem Cell Array®, the premier automated robotic platform for reprogramming adult cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These iPSCs carry the genetic blueprint of the person from whom they are derived and can be turned into any cell type in the body, allowing scientists to study disease mechanisms in affected cells or modify them for use in therapeutics.“Our mission is to bring lifesaving treatments to patients around the world and we are excited to further this goal in partnership with Cytovia,” says NYSCF CEO and founder Susan L. Solomon. “It is critical that we collaborate with partners using our technology and expertise to bring innovative treatments to the market.”“We are delighted to collaborate with the NYSCF Research Institute to develop iPSC-derived NK and CAR NK therapeutics,” says Dr. Daniel Teper, CEO of Cytovia. “By integrating NYSCF's world-class stem cell know-how and the precision gene-editing research conducted at the University of California San Francisco, Cytovia aims to become a leader in NK cell therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.”About The New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute
