TrendMicro said it had prepared a guidance document that was used to guide victims in patching the vulnerability and uninstalling the miner.At least 20,000 infected routers were found, a number that was reduced by at least 78 percent by the collaborative action when it ceased in November. Efforts are still continuing to remove the malware.Private entity Cyber Defense Institute also assisted the operation, said Interpol.“When faced with emerging cybercrimes like cryptojacking, the importance of strong partnerships between police and the cybersecurity industry cannot be overstated,” said Interpol director of cybercrime Craig Jones. “By combining the expertise and data on cyberthreats held by the private sector with the investigative capabilities of law enforcement, we can best protect our communities from all forms of cybercrime.”Related StoriesMulticoin Capital Hires Principal in Asia as Crypto VCs Look EastSecurity Token Platform iSTOX Lands Another Big Asian BackerThe State of Security Token Regulations in AsiaReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAsian markets slammed again as virus fears cause global turmoilAFPCoronavirus epidemic takes billion-dollar economic toll on Seattle-area businessesAmerican City Business JournalsDollar Bond Market in Asia Gets Rougher for Virus-Hit BorrowersBloombergAsian Countries Wield Fines, Jail Terms to Stop Coronavirus Quarantine ViolationsThe Wall Street JournalBanks in Asia, Europe Grapple with CoronavirusThe Wall Street JournalBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
