But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term Scholium Group Plc (LON:SCHO) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 48% over a half decade. See our latest analysis for Scholium Group Given that Scholium Group only made minimal earnings in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue to gauge its business development. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. For shareholders to have confidence a company will grow profits significantly, it must grow revenue.In the last half decade, Scholium Group saw its revenue increase by 5.4% per year. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. Given this fairly low revenue growth (and lack of profits), it's not particularly surprising to see the stock down 12% (annualized) in the same time frame. The key question is whether the company can make it to profitability, and beyond, without trouble. Shareholders will want the company to approach profitability if it can't grow revenue any faster.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).AIM:SCHO Income Statement, January 9th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Scholium Group's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 18% in the last year, Scholium Group shareholders lost 11%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 12% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm.
