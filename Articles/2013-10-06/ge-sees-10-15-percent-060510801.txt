We think we should see 10-15 percent growth," said Rice of this projection for its composite infrastructure businesses in markets outside of the U.S. and Europe.He noted, however, that the financing of infrastructure projects by banks was getting more complicated amid greater economic uncertainty, including concerns the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon begin reducing its stimulus that has already weakened some Asian currencies like the Indonesian rupiah."When you have the currency swings you have to be even better in connecting capital to infrastructure projects," said Rice.The oil and gas equipment business was also singled out as one of GE's key growth areas, signaling the importance of energy to the conglomerate as it retreats from finance and returns to its industrial roots.(Reporting by James Pomfret; Editing by Michael Perry)
