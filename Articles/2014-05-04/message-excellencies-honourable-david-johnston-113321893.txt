OTTAWA, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - May 4, 2014) -
Mental illness is one of the most complex and pressing health issues we are facing today. Depression, anxiety, mood disorders and addictive disorders do not discriminate and will affect almost 20 percent of the population to varying degrees at some point in their lives. Almost every Canadian knows someone-a family member, a friend, a colleague-who is suffering, or has suffered, from a mental illness.Since the beginning of my mandate, my wife Sharon and I have had the opportunity to meet with people from all across the country, and to learn more about the experiences of those living with mental health problems and the innovative initiatives in place to support mental health. We both believe it is essential to recognize the existence of mental illness and to acknowledge the impact it has on our society, just as we do for physical illnesses.We have made great strides in understanding mental illness and fighting its associated prejudices, but too many people still suffer in silence.During this Mental Health Week, Sharon and I invite you to learn more, to talk about and to think about the various issues related to mental health, and to find out how you can help.Mental health is everyone's concern.David JohnstonFollow GGDavidJohnston and RideauHall on Facebook and Twitter
