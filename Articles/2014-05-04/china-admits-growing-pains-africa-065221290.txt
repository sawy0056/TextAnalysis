But tensions exist around allegations of shoddy construction and a lack of respect for employment and other local laws. China has also faced allegations that its pervasive influence has more than a whiff of colonialism about it."I wish to assure our African friends in all seriousness that China will never pursue a colonialist path like some countries did or allow colonialism, which belonged to the past, to reappear in Africa," Li said.Li said companies have encountered "growing pains" and the Chinese government takes such issues seriously. He said that problems in the China-Africa relationship were, however, "isolated cases."Last year, Zambia's government seized control of a Chinese-run coal mine, saying Chinese managers had failed to address safety, health and environmental concerns. In 2010, two Chinese managers at the mine were accused of shooting miners during a labor dispute, and later clashes reportedly saw one Chinese worker killed and two others injured.Li also urged African countries to protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies and the safety of their employees. China has come under increasing pressure from its citizens to protect their rights abroad.Li and his wife Cheng Hong are on a weeklong trip to Ethiopia, Nigeria, Angola and Kenya, the first time the premier has visited Africa since assuming office last year. Li will visit the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa and attend the 2014 World Economic Forum on Africa, held in Nigeria.
