He said Dotcom had not indicated why he could not fight the extradition charge without full access to the evidence.The evidence in question refers to documents included in Dotcom's belongings, including laptops and hard drives, which were seized when the New Zealand government in 2012 arrested the internet tycoon at his mansion near Auckland in a SWAT team-style raid requested by U.S. authorities.Friday's ruling deals another knock to Dotcom's defense, coming just a month after the High Court ruled last month that the search warrant used in the arrest of the entrepreneur and his colleagues was legal. Dotcom is appealing that decision.U.S. attorney Ira Rothken, a member of Dotcom's legal team, said that the ruling was "quite robust," adding it could put the defense at a disadvantage at the extradition hearing."We have a much higher hurdle because of today's ruling in getting disclosures, and that will impact the fairness of the hearing," Rothken told Reuters.Dotcom, who also goes by the name of Kim Schmitz, says Megaupload was merely an online warehouse and should not be held accountable if stored content was obtained illegally. The site housed everything from family photos to Hollywood blockbusters and was one of the most visited sites on the Internet in its heyday.The U.S. Justice Department counters that Megaupload encouraged piracy by paying users who uploaded popular content and by deleting content that was not regularly downloaded.(Editing by Stephen Coates)
