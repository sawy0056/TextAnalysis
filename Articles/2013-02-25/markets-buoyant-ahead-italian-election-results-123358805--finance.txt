Results are expected to start emerging late in the European session."This has a significant impact upon the strength of the eurozone going forward given the size and significant of the Italian economy," said Joshua Maloney, an analyst at Alpari.Investors in Italy were showing few concerns, as Milan's FTSE MIB raced up 2.2 percent to 16,592.

Last week, the minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting showed concern over the central bank's monetary stimulus, stoking jitters in the markets. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Congress are also grappling over the budget again.Earlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 surged 2.4 percent to end at 11,662.52 while the yen dropped further against the dollar after local news outlets reported that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was preparing to nominate Haruhiko Kuroda as the next governor of the Bank of Japan.Kuroda is an Oxford-educated former vice-minister of finance who is currently president of the Asian Development Bank. The 67-year-old is seen as someone who backs Abe's plan to jumpstart the world's third-largest economy by fighting deflation through monetary easing and hefty government spending."The market has become very excited over this news as he will be a market friendly choice," said Chris Weston of IG Markets.Since the Asian session, the yen has recovered and the dollar was trading 0.6 percent lower at 93.77 yen.
