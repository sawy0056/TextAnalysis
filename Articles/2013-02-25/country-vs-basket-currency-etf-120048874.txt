ETFs continue to open up the doors to international markets that were previously too difficult, or costly, to access for mainstream investors. Those looking for the most direct exposure to a foreign economy often choose to invest in the local currency rather than equity or bond funds, especially when looking for a risky but potentially high return in a slow global market.
