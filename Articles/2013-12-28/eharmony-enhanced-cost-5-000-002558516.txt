Online matchmaker eHarmony is offering the eH+ premium service to make it easier if you are having a hard time finding a mate on your own. The service is partly inspired by “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,” although eHarmony was considering it before the new movie came along.According to MarketWatch, the company’s pitch is:Pay us $5,000 and you’ll get a personal counselor to help not only sift through matches and help you with your profile — as the counselor did with Walter Mitty in the movie — but also quietly approach them on your behalf.The movie features an eHarmony counselor “who regularly calls [Mitty] on the phone to talk about his romantic problems and offer advice,” says Time. You won’t get as much attention in the real-life version.The $5,000 is the yearly rate. EHarmony’s regular service costs $60 a month.The company hopes to have 1,000 eH+ customers by the end of 2014, says Marketwatch. A survey of 15,000 members with annual incomes of $250,000 or more revealed that there’s a big demand for this kind of extra help, the company said.Counselors will be only a phone or Skype call away — or you can visit them in person if you live near eHarmony’s Santa Monica, Calif., location.Let’s say you have lots of disposable income.
