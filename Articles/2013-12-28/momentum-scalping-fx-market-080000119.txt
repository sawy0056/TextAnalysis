Talking Points:
This is an archived webinar from the Live Classroom of DailyFX PLUS, in which I trade my scalping strategy in live conditions
This webinar was recorded on December 17, 2013; the day before the FOMC Taper announcement
After showing the strategy, and how I trigger positions; we look at how a profitable position can be managed as the market moves in the ideal direction.
