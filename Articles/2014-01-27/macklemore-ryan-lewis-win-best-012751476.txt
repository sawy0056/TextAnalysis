Queen Latifah will officiate at the nuptials."Before there was any media, before there was any buzz about us, before there was a story, there was our fans and it spread organically through them," said Macklemore, whose real name is Ben Haggerty, as he accepted the award for the duo.Macklemore & Ryan Lewis landed seven Grammy nods, and will vie for the night's biggest prize, album of the year, with pop singer Sara Bareilles, French electronic music duo Daft Punk, rapper Kendrick Lamar and country pop star Taylor Swift.In early awards before the telecast from Los Angeles' Staples Center began, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis swept the rap categories - best rap album, song and performance. Pharrell Williams won music producer of the year for his work with artists including Robin Thicke, Jay Z and Jennifer Hudson.MADONNA, MCCARTNEY, RINGOThe 56th Grammy Awards, the music industry's top honors handed out by the Recording Academy across 82 categories, may be remembered more for its performances and unscripted moments than the awards that are bestowed."Material Girl" Madonna will make an appearance. And the two surviving Beatles, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, will also both perform at the ceremony before they are honored on Monday for the 50th anniversary of their arrival in the United States, where they appeared on "The Ed Sullivan Show."Other eye-popping collaborations include Stevie Wonder with Daft Punk and alt-rock group Imagine Dragons teaming up with newcomomer Kendrick Lamar. Heavy metal group Metallica will jam with Chinese classical pianist Lang Lang.While some of the surprise performances have been leaked in recent days, the news of a mass wedding came as a big surprise after it was reported in the New York Times early on Sunday.For Macklemore & Ryan Lewis the event took on a personal note with the participation of Lewis' sister Laura, who will marry her boyfriend during the ceremony."A night that is already tremendous for me, for the music," the Times quoted him as saying, "but to have my sister get married and my family there watching it - that makes it a whole other level of amazing."
