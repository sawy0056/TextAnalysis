Our Take
Texas-based Hanger leads the orthotic and prosthetic (“O&P”) patient care services market, operating across more than 740 patient care centers in the U.S. The company’s economies of scale are unmatched by competition.  We are impressed by the company’s ability to grow its top as well as bottom line despite the exposure to reimbursement uncertainties and its aggressive acquisition strategy, which has inherent risks.
