Growth figures for Germany, Europe's largest economy, also showed a 0.6 percent contraction for that period.The eurozone has been in a recession for the past three quarters.The negative growth data pushed the euro lower against the dollar and weighed on prices by making crude priced in dollars more expensive and a less attractive investment for traders using currencies other than the greenback.
