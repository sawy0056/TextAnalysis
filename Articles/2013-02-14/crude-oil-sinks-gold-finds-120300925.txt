Crude oil fell amid risk aversion but gold rose on an increased chance of the ECB joining global stimulus efforts in the wake of dismal Eurozone GDP figures.Talking PointsCrude Oil, Copper Sold as Eurozone GDP Slump Sinks Risk AppetiteGold and Silver Rise as European Recession Boosts ECB Easing HopesCrude oil and copper prices are following European stocks lower amid a broad-based unwinding of risk appetite in the wake of a disappointing roundup of fourth-quarter Eurozone GDP figures. The region-wide composite gauge showed output shrank 0.6 percent, a larger decline than economists’ predicted 0.4 percent contraction. The result marked the worst reading since the 2.8 percent drop recorded in March 2009 in the heart of the Great Recession. Cumulatively, the single currency area adds up to the world’s second-largest economy and increasingly acute weakness there bodes ill for global output at large, hurting cycle-sensitive commodities. S&P 500 futures are pointing sharply lower, hinting at more of the same as Wall Street comes online.Gold and silver are pushing higher in a move that seems to reflect the implications of soft Eurozone GDP data for ECB monetary policy. Mario Draghi and company have shown significantly more restraint than their counterparts at banks including the Fed and BOJ. Indeed, 3-year LTRO repayments have actually producing a sort of tightening, shrinking the ECB’s balance sheet to the smallest in a year. Deepening recession may nudge the bank toward introducing added accommodation as an offset (in fact, policymakers alluded to just such an outcome in their monthly bulletin), broadly expanding global reflation efforts and boosting anti-fiat assets.
