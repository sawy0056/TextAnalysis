Support: 0.8307 (trend line)
Resistance:0.8348 (Jan 13 high), 0.8390 (23.6% Fib exp.) The Euro is stalling at near-term resistance at 0.8348, the January 13 high, after producing a significant breakout against the British Pound. A continued push higher targets the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 0.8390. Falling trend line resistance-turned-support begins at 0.8307.Prices are too close to relevant resistance to justify a long position from a risk/reward perspective at this point. Meanwhile, an indecision candle on the latest daily bar may precede a pullback but could just as well amount to nothing more than a pause in the advance. This warns against attempting to get short for now and we will continue to stand aside.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
