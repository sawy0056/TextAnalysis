Support: 0.8952 (38.2% Fib ret., trend line), 0.8896 (50% Fib ret.)
Resistance: 0.9021 (23.6% Fib ret.), 0.9085 (Jan 13 high) The Australian Dollar has turned lower against its US counterpart expected after prices showed a Shooting Star candlestick below resistance in the 0.9085, the January 13 high. Support at 0.8952, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, a barrier reinforced by a rising trend line set from late January. A daily close beneath this level exposes the 50% Fib at 0.8896. Alternatively, a turn above the 23.6% level at 0.9021 aims for 0.9085 anew. Prices are too close to relevant support to justify a short position from a risk/reward perspective, while a viable reversal signal arguing in favor of a long trade is absent. We will remain on the sidelines for now until a more actionable setup presents itself.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
