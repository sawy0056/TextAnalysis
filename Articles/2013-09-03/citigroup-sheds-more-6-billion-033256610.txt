The bank is trying to sell that fund to its management, people told the paper.

It prohibits banks from investing in any funds they do not manage. It also limits the amount of money banks can invest in private equity and hedge funds to 3 percent of high-quality tier one capital.Officials at Citigroup could not be reached for comment by Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours.(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Matt Driskill)
