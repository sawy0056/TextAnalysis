At closing, this transaction is expected to strengthen Nokia's financial position and provide a solid basis for future investment in these three businesses."After a thorough assessment of how to maximize shareholder value, including consideration of a variety of alternatives, we believe this transaction is the best path forward for Nokia and its shareholders," said Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Nokia Board of Directors and, following today's announcement, also Nokia interim CEO.Deal TermsSubject to the closing of the transaction, Microsoft will acquire substantially all of Nokia's Devices & Services business, including the Mobile Phones and Smart Devices business units as well as an industry-leading design team, operations including all Nokia Devices & Services production facilities, Devices & Services-related sales and marketing activities, and related support functions. At closing, approximately 32,000 people are expected to transfer to Microsoft, including approximately 4,700 people in Finland. Nokia's CTO (Chief Technology Office) organization and patent portfolio will remain within the Nokia Group. The operations that are planned to be transferred to Microsoft generated an estimated EUR 14.9 billion, or almost 50%, of Nokia's net sales for the full year 2012.As part of the transaction, Nokia will grant Microsoft a 10 year non- exclusive license to its patents as of the time of the closing, and Microsoft will grant Nokia reciprocal rights related to HERE services. In addition, Nokia will grant Microsoft an option to extend this mutual patent agreement to perpetuity. Of the total purchase price of EUR 5.44 billion, EUR 3.79 billion relates to the purchase of substantially all of the Devices & Services business, and EUR 1.65 billion relates to the mutual patent agreement and future option.Additionally, Microsoft will become a strategic licensee of the HERE platform, and will separately pay Nokia for a four year license. This revenue stream is expected to substantially replace the revenue stream HERE is currently receiving from Nokia's Devices & Services business internally. If the transaction closes Microsoft is expected to become one of the top three customers of HERE.Microsoft has agreed to make immediately available to Nokia EUR 1.5 billion of financing in the form of three EUR 500 million tranches of convertible bonds to be issued by Nokia maturing in 5, 6 and 7 years respectively. It is at Nokia's discretion if it chooses to draw down all or some of these tranches. The financing is not conditional on the transaction closing. If the transaction closes, any outstanding bonds will be redeemed and netted against the deal proceeds by the amount of principal and accrued interest.The following are the key terms of the three tranches of bonds Nokia may choose to issue:Story continues* The first tranche matures in 5 years and has a 1.125% per annum coupon payable semi-annually with an initial conversion price of EUR 3.9338.* The second tranche matures in 6 years and has a 2.5% per annum coupon payable semi-annually with an initial conversion price of EUR 4.0851.* The third tranche matures in 7 years and has a 3.625% per annum coupon payable semi-annually with an initial conversion price of EUR 4.2364. The Board of Directors of Nokia will separately assess whether to draw down some or all of this financing. If Nokia would decide to utilize this financing option, the earliest that Microsoft could convert any of these bonds to shares is two years from draw down.Microsoft has agreed to a 10 year license arrangement with Nokia to use the Nokia brand on current Mobile Phones products. Nokia will continue to own and maintain the Nokia brand. Under the terms of the transaction, Microsoft has agreed to a 10 year license arrangement with Nokia to use the Nokia brand on current and subsequently developed products based on the Series 30 and Series 40 operating systems. Upon the closing of the transaction, Nokia would be restricted from licensing the Nokia brand for use in connection with mobile device sales for 30 months and from using the Nokia brand on Nokia's own mobile devices until December 31, 2015.The transaction is subject to potential purchase price adjustments, protecting both Nokia and Microsoft, and a USD 750 million termination fee payable by Microsoft to Nokia in the event that the transaction fails to receive necessary regulatory clearances.Building Nokia's next chapterFollowing the transaction, Nokia plans to focus on its three established businesses, each of which is a leader in enabling mobility in its respective market segment: NSN, a leader in network infrastructure and services; HERE, a leader in mapping and location services; and Advanced Technologies, a leader in technology development and licensing.Nokia will retain its headquarters in Finland. Excluding the approximately 32,000 people planned to transfer to Microsoft, Nokia would have employed approximately 56,000 people at the end of the second quarter 2013."Today is an important moment of change and reinvention for Nokia and its employees," said Nokia Chairman and interim CEO Mr. Siilasmaa.

At the same time, Advanced Technologies plans to continue to build Nokia's patent portfolio from this innovation and targets to expand its industry-leading technology licensing program, spanning technologies that enable mobility today and tomorrow."Following this transaction, Nokia's financial situation is expected to be significantly stronger and its earnings profile significantly improved," said Nokia CFO and interim President Timo Ihamuotila.

If this transaction as well as Nokia's acquisition of 50% of NSN would have closed before the end of the second quarter 2013, Nokia would have ended the quarter with gross cash of EUR 14.9 billion and net cash of EUR 7.8 billion, excluding transaction related expenses and taxes. Assuming repayment of financing facilities related to the NSN acquisition as well as Nokia's debt facilities of EUR 1.8 billion maturing before the end of the first quarter 2014, Nokia would have ended the second quarter 2013 with gross cash of EUR 11.4 billion and net cash of EUR 7.8 billion, excluding transaction related expenses and taxes. This compares to reported gross cash of EUR 9.5 billion and net cash of EUR 4.1 billion at the end of the second quarter 2013.Nokia's Board of Directors is conducting a strategy evaluation for Nokia Group between signing and closing of the transaction. This evaluation will comprise of evaluations of strategies for each of Nokia's three businesses and possible synergies between them, as well as an evaluation of the optimal corporate and capital structure for Nokia after the closing of the transaction. After this evaluation is complete, deemed excess capital is planned to be distributed to shareholders.Nokia expects to book a gain on sale of approximately EUR 3.2 billion from the transaction, excluding any potential tax implications, gains or losses related to currency translation differences triggered by the transaction. In connection with the transaction, Nokia will be required to evaluate whether the impact of the sale on future cash flows or operating results requires changes in the carrying values of any of its remaining assets or liabilities. This evaluation will include, among other things, a review of existing goodwill balances for impairment and the potential recoverability of deferred tax assets currently subject to valuation allowance. Additional assets and liabilities may require adjustment upon completion of our review.Nokia LeadershipNokia today announced changes to its leadership as a result of the proposed transaction.
