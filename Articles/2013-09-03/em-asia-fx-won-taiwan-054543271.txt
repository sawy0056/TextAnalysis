* Won at 4-mth high on offshore funds, foreign stock buying* Taiwan dollar hits 3-mth high on inflows, exporters* Ringgit higher after fuel subsides cut(Adds comment, updates prices)By Jongwoo CheonSINGAPORE, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The South Korean won and theTaiwan dollar led gains among emerging Asian currencies onTuesday as solid factory data around the globe and a delay in apossible U.S. strike on Syria boosted risk appetite.The Malaysian ringgit touched a three-week highafter the country cut fuel subsides to reduce its fiscaldeficit, which had prompted capital outflows.The won hit a four-month high on demand fromoffshore funds. The Taiwan dollar also rose to itshighest in almost three months on foreign financial inflows andexporters.Regional stocks gained on the back of strong manufacturingactivity in China and Europe.Still, investors stayed cautious ahead of U.S. August jobsdata due on Friday, seeking clues to when the Federal Reservewill start reducing its bond-buying programme."The won will keep rising as it breached importantresistance levels such as a 200-day moving average," said JeongMy-young, Samsung Futures research head in Seoul."But gains in other Asian currencies are seen as onlytechnical rebounds after sharp falls. It is difficult to buysome troubled currencies as their governments have not providedstrong solutions, and on the looming Fed decision to cut assetpurchases," Jeong added.The embattled Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiahwere left out of the regional rallies reflectinginvestors' lack of confidence.Indonesia posted a record trade deficit in July, suggestingpolicymakers will struggle to narrow the gaping current accountgap.WONThe won rose as much as 0.6 percent to 1,093.8 per dollar,its strongest since May 9 as offshore funds chased it amidcontinuous share-buying by foreign investors.Offshore funds covered short-positions which they had builtup expecting the won to stay weaker than 1,100, traders said.Some foreign investors added fresh bullish bets, they added.Foreign exchange authorities have not been spottedattempting to stem the won's strength, traders said, despitegrowing concerns over intervention."I can see few signs of a retreat to 1,104. A key is U.S.jobs data on Friday. But the won will not weaken much if thenumber is much better than expectations," said a foreign banktrader in Seoul.The South Korean currency on Monday strengthened past a200-day moving average, which was at 1,104.0 in the previousday.The next level is seen at 1,083.0, its high on May 9,analysts said.Still, some offshore funds took profits, while custodianbanks bought dollars on dips, limiting the won's upside, traderssaid.TAIWAN DOLLARThe Taiwan dollar jumped 0.7 percent to 29.705 to thegreenback, its strongest since June 7, on inflows from foreignfinancial institutions.Exporters also chased the island's unit when it was weakerthan 29.760, traders said.But the central bank was spotted buying the U.S. dollar at29.700 to limit the Taiwan dollar's appreciation, traders added.The currency has a 200-day moving average at 29.697, and hasbeen weaker than the average since early May.RINGGITThe ringgit rose 0.5 percent to 3.2585 per dollar, itsstrongest since Aug. 13 as offshore funds bought, andgovernment bond yields slipped on buying.Late on Monday, Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak lookedto sidestep political opponents and temper market jitters bycutting fuel subsidies to beef up the country's fiscal position,which had spurred capital outflows.But the Malaysian currency gave up some of gains withimmediate chart resistance at 3.2600 and on expectations of Fedtapering."I don't think the ringgit will break 3.25 even, unless Fedtapering is postponed to December," said an Asian bank trader inSingapore.CURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLARChange on the day at 0505 GMTCurrency Latest bid Previous day Pct MoveJapan yen 99.43 99.33 -0.10Sing dlr 1.2723 1.2735 +0.09Taiwan dlr 29.769 29.900 +0.44Korean won 1096.15 1100.50 +0.40Baht 31.99 32.07 +0.23Peso 44.31 44.42 +0.26Rupiah 10999.00 10970.00 -0.26Rupee 66.75 66.00 -1.12Ringgit 3.2600 3.2740 +0.43Yuan 6.1204 6.1196 -0.01Change so far in 2013Currency Latest bid End prev year Pct MoveJapan yen 99.43 86.79 -12.71Sing dlr 1.2723 1.2219 -3.96Taiwan dlr 29.769 29.136 -2.13Korean won 1096.15 1070.60 -2.33Baht 31.99 30.61 -4.31Peso 44.31 41.05 -7.35Rupiah 10999.00 9630.00 -12.45Rupee 66.75 54.99 -17.62Ringgit 3.2600 3.0580 -6.20Yuan 6.1204 6.2303 +1.80(Additional reporting by KyoungHo Lee in SEOUL and Roger Tungin TAIPEI; Editing by Eric Meijer)
