India's currency dropped to record lows against the US dollar in August.The panel said that net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows would likely be at $21.7 billion (13.7 billion pounds) for the current fiscal year, down from an earlier estimate of $24 billion.(Reporting by Manoj Kumar and Rajesh Kumar Singh)
