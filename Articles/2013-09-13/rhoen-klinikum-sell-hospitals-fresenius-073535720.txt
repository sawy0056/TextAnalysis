Braun weighed in with the purchase of enough shares to fend off the suitor.Muench, who has continued to campaign for a sale, and he and his detractors have engaged each other in legal action.Sources have said B. Braun saw the deal as putting it at risk of losing Rhoen as a client to Fresenius while Asklepios feared that a dominant player would be able trump rivals when public-sector hospitals were put up for auction.B. Braun and Asklepios declined to comment on Friday.The acquisition would boost Helios' sales by about 2 billion euros and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by about 250 million, Fresenius said.Helios would have 117 hospitals across Germany and sales of nearly 5.5 billion euros after integration of the Rhoen facilities.Fresenius said the purchase price would be entirely debt financed and it would not assume any of Rhoen's debt.The ratio of the Fresenius group's net debt to core earnings would temporarily rise above 3.0 this year but remain below 3.5 before returning to the 2.5-3.0 target range next year, the company added.Rhoen said in a separate statement that it planned to pay a special dividend of up to 1.9 billion euros, funded by transaction proceeds and reserves, on top of its regular dividend. It was also mulling buying back its own shares.Proceeds also would be used to repay debt, with a further 200 million euros slated for investments, it said.After the sale, Rhoen would still control several hospitals, including university hospitals in the cities of Giessen and Marburg, and have revenue of about 1 billion euros, it said.The deal requires approval by antitrust authorities as well as minority shareholders in some of the hospitals concerned.(Editing by Stephen Coates and Jane Merriman)
