LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 25, 2013) - Sportswear (aka activewear) is a hallmark of American fashion and has steadily increased in popularity over the years, particularly among women with active and fast-paced lifestyles. As a result, Los Angeles native Katherine Khuat has launched Starlette Apparel, a sportswear clothing company offering a variety of fashion designs for women of all ages."Starlette Apparel offers a variety of designs for women, with the goal of inspiring and empowering those who have on-the-go lifestyles," said Katherine Khuat, president of Starlette Apparel, a Los Angeles-based sportswear clothing company."I'm excited about this brand and taking it to the next level," said Khuat.Due to her modeling and acting commitments, Starlette Apparel has been a side project of Khuat's for some time, but she now hopes to jumpstart the brand with the introduction of new designs and an expansion of the product line.With the economy finally emerging from the doldrums, the sportswear market has shown signs of life as well. According to Euromonitor International, the global sportswear market expanded by roughly 7.5% in 2012, exceeding $240 billion. Approximately $80 billion of that revenue was generated in the United States alone. Khuat notes that these figures directly reflect the high demand for her types of products."If you have a great product, solid branding and good word-of-mouth, there's no such thing as oversaturation," said Khuat. "There's a lot of demand in this industry for quality products and I feel Starlette Apparel is capable of capturing a healthy portion of this growing market."For more information, visit http://www.KatherineKhuat.org or www.StarletteApparel.com.About Katherine KhuatBased in Los Angeles, Katherine Khuat started her modeling career at the age of twelve and soon began her acting career doing commercials.
