Crude oil may fall amid deterioration in risk appetite while gold gains on Fed QE continuity bets if weekly US jobless claims data proves disappointing.Talking Points Gold, Silver May Rise as Dovish FOMC Minutes Stoke Anti-Fiat Demand
Crude Oil and Copper Look to Earnings Docket to Establish Risk Trends Commodity prices are little-changed ahead of the US trading session. A relatively quiet economic calendar is headlined by weekly Jobless Claims figures. Economists’ forecasts call for a slight improvement on the closely-watched Initial Claims print, but a downside surprise in line with the deterioration in US news-flow relative to expectations since late March seems like a distinct possibility. Such an outcome may weigh on risk appetite, pushing cycle-linked crude oil and copper prices lower. A soft print may be supportive for gold and silver however, reinforcing Fed QE continuity expectations and thereby amplifying anti-fiat demand while compounding overnight pressure on the US Dollar.Want to see economic data releases directly on your charts?
