NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson stopped selling some of its products through Amazon.com Inc because it felt the online retailer was not doing enough to stop third-party merchants from selling damaged or expired J&J merchandise, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said J&J has resumed selling some of the items on Amazon.com, but the disagreements have yet to be fully resolved.In July, Amazon's CFO said business generated from third-party merchants accounted for about 40 percent of items sold in the second quarter.Amazon and J&J could not be immediately reached for comment.
