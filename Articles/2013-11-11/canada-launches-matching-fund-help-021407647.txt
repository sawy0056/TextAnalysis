OTTAWA, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Nov 10, 2013) -
Canada is calling on Canadians to help support the people affected by the devastating effects of Typhoon Haiyan through a matching fund. The announcement was made today by the Honourable Christian Paradis, Minister of International Development and La Francophonie"Time and time again Canadians have demonstrated they are among the most compassionate and generous people in the world. Our Government is making sure their contributions can do more to ease pain and suffering," said Minister Paradis. "Through this fund, for every eligible dollar donated by individual Canadians to registered Canadian charities in response to the crisis in the Philippines the government will donate an additional dollar - effectively doubling their contribution."Typhoon Haiyan has caused widespread devastation in the Philippines affecting an estimated 9.5 million people. Over 615,000 people are currently displaced and well over 1,000 people have died according to the Philippine Red Cross. The numbers are expected to increase as more affected areas become accessible. The people of the Philippines and other affected countries by this storm are in dire need of clean water, hygiene and sanitation supplies, food, medicines and shelter.Canada is also deploying the Interdepartmental Strategic Support Team, to assess needs on ground and identify potential response options, which could include the Disaster Assistance Response Team."On November 9, 2013, I announced up to $5 million in support to humanitarian organizations this is in addition to the Matching Fund that I am announcing today. This storm has had a devastating impact on the people of the Philippines, and sadly, it is not yet over. In the coming days, we will continue to monitor the situation, we will work with our partners to meet humanitarian needs and we will stand ready to provide further assistance if required," added the Minister.The announcement made on November 9 was in addition to the initial allocation of $30,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross on Friday, November 8 to help launch relief operations and meet the needs of those affected by this crisis. Emergency relief activities will include the provision of emergency shelter, food, water, livelihood support, and other essential services.BackgrounderOn November 9, 2013, the Government of Canada announced up to $5 million in support to humanitarian organizations striving to meet the needs of the people affected by Typhoon Haiyan (locally known as Yolanda). In addition, an initial allocation of $30,000 was made by DFATD to the International Federation of the Red Cross on Friday, November 8 to help launch relief operations and meet the needs of those affected by this crisis. Emergency relief activities will include the provision of emergency shelter, food, water, livelihood support, and other essential services.With the recent successive emergencies in the Philippines which began with the outbreak of fighting in Zamboanga City and Basilan on September 9 and the 7.2 magnitude Bohol earthquake on October 15, the response capacities of UN agencies and other humanitarian actors are overstretched.Today, Canada announced the establishment of a mechanism to match donations made by individual Canadians to registered Canadian charities. For every eligible dollar donated by individual Canadians to registered Canadian charities in response to the impact of Typhoon Haiyan on the Philippines and other affected countries, the government will set aside one dollar for the Typhoon Haiyan Relief Fund. The government will use the Typhoon Haiyan Relief Fund to provide assistance through international and Canadian humanitarian organizations, employing established channels and procedures.To be counted for the purposes of the Typhoon Haiyan Relief Fund, donations from individual Canadians may not exceed $100,000 per individual and must be:monetary in nature; made to a registered Canadian charity that is receiving donations in response to the impact of Typhoon Haiyan; specifically earmarked for response to the impact of Typhoon Haiyan; and, be made between November 9 and December 9, 2013.To ensure that donations are eligible for the matching program, you should ensure that:the donation complies with the conditions outlined above; the registered charity receiving the donation will be using the funds in response to the humanitarian crisis related to the impact of Typhoon Haiyan; and, the registered charity receiving the donation will be declaring it to DFATD.It is up to the registered Canadian charity to certify, through a declaration form (to be made available on the DFTAD web site), that the donations declared are eligible. Registered Canadian charities are under no obligation to declare donations to DFATD if they are not satisfied that they meet eligibility requirements. Registered charities declaring eligible donations must complete the declaration form. Forms must be received by DFATD on or before December 23, 2013 for donations to be counted towards the size of the relief fund.Story continuesThe relief fund will provide effective and accountable financial support to experienced Canadian and international humanitarian organizations to meet immediate needs in response to the crisis in the Philippines and other affected countries. Working through established Canadian and international humanitarian organizations will ensure an effective and timely response.For more information on how to donate, Canadians can visit the Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada website, or consult the list of registered Canadian charities on the Canada Revenue Agency website.
