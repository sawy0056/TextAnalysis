ssi_aud-usd_body_Picture_11.png, FOREX ANALYSIS: Australian Dollar Forecast Turns PositiveMoresAUDUSD – A sharp shift in retail forex trading sentiment suggests that the US Dollar (ticker: USDOLLAR) may fall further against the resurgent Australian Dollar. Last week we were plainly in favor of AUDUSD weakness as the majority of retail traders remained long. Yet short interest has surged 59 percent while the number of longs fell 32 percent through that stretch—leaving trading crowds net-short once more. We see further risk of short-term AUDUSD strength given the sharp sentiment shift. --- Written by David Rodriguez, Quantitative Strategist for DailyFX.com To receive the Speculative Sentiment Index and other reports from this author via e-mail, sign up for his distribution list via this link.
