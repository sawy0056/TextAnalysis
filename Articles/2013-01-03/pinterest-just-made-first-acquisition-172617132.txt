Pinterest just acquired recipe sharing site Punchfork for an undisclosed amount, marking the company's first acquisition. Punchfork, which is essentially a Pinterest for recipes, will continue to operate for the short term but will eventually shut down its site, mobile apps, and tools for developers."We believe that a unified destination benefits our users in the long run," Punchfork CEO Jeff Miller wrote on the company blog.Punchfork launched in January 2011 as a place to help food lovers discover new recipes and share them with friends. As part of the acquisition, the team from Punchfork will begin working on the Pinterest platform, but details are scarce regarding what features from Punchfork will be integrated into Pinterest."Punchfork helps people discover popular new recipes in a visual way and encourages them to share these recipes with their family and friends," a Pinterest spokesperson told Business Insider via email. "People come to Pinterest to find inspiration for their everyday lives and we think Punchfork’s mission aligns with this well."More From Business Insider San Francisco Office Costs Soar The Most In The WorldGoogle Is Pouring More Money Into StartupsEven Though The Hype Has Died Down, Pinterest's Traffic Is Still Exploding
