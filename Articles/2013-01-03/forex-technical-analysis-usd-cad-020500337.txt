The goal now is to identify the secondary low (wave 2 or B). Price is consolidating around the 50% retracement of the rally from 9632 and a move above 9881 would break the series of lower lows.” Near term pattern (since the December low) isn’t especially clear. The case can be made for an impulsive interpretation of both the rally from 9824 and the decline from 9971. In other words, that evidence is of no use right now. It’s best to wait for clarification.FOREXTrading Strategy: Nothing for now.LEVELS: 9717 9794 9825 9907 9971 10009DailyFX provides forex news and technical analysis on the trends that influence the global currency markets.Learn forex trading with a free practice account and trading charts from FXCM.
