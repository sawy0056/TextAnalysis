Dave Mustaine, lead singer of heavy metal band Megadeth (and formerly of Metallica), has gotten 8,600 likes for a 428-word rant against suit retailer Men's Wearhouse. His beef? He bought his manager a gift certificate that was not delivered in time for Christmas.Not cool, Men's Wearhouse!Mustaine has vowed to boycott the chain whose founder, George Zimmer, promises, "You're going to like the way you look; I guarantee it":We are all living in very tight financial times right now, and like I said, you may not wear a suit for your job or for an event or occasion, but if you do, I would strongly recommend you wear someone else’s suits. Go to Jos. A Bank instead. I for one, will never set foot in a Men’s Warehouse, even for shelter from a blizzard.I absolutely GUARANTEE it.The company -- doubtless knowing that failing to respond to this sort of thing can go viral very quickly -- left a message offering to help Mustaine on his Facebook page on Jan. 2, and also tweeted at him. " Dave, thanks for reaching out to us on Facebook. We apologize for the delay in receiving your gift card and agree that the delay is unacceptable," the company told him.Megadeth fans, meanwhile, have filed 1,300 comments on Mustaine v. Men's, and they're about evenly mixed between those laughing at him and those laughing with him.Here's the post, in case it disappears:More From Business Insider The First Ad Campaign On Facebook's Poke Is For ...
