Economists were warning that the cuts could eventually trigger a recession in the world's largest economy.Wall Street stocks soared Wednesday amid investor relief that Republicans and Democrats had hammered out a last-minute deal. However, the compromise left many issues unresolved.The deal doesn't include any significant deficit-cutting agreement, meaning the country still doesn't have a long-term plan on how to curb spending. Big cuts to defense and domestic programs weren't worked out but instead were delayed for two months."Continued advances will depend on how spending deals are or are not negotiated over the next two months and whether any down payment on the national debt is made," said analysts at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore.In early European trading, Britain's FTSE 100 fell marginally to 6,025.70.
