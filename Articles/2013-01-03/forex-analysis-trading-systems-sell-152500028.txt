ssi_eur-usd_body_Picture_7.png, FOREX ANALYSIS: Trading Systems Sell Euro on Major Sentiment ShiftMoreA noteworthy shift in retail FX trading sentiment warns that the Euro may have set a short-term top versus the US Dollar (ticker: USDOLLAR), and one of our sentiment-based trading strategies has accordingly taken a short position from $1.3193. Traders have remained net-short the EURUSD since the pair traded above $1.27 through mid-November, and normally we would treat this as a contrarian signal in favor of further strength. Yet the number of traders short has fallen by 14 percent while longs are up a noteworthy 38 percent since last week. Timing reversals is risky, but we see early evidence of an important EURUSD turn lower. --- Written by David Rodriguez, Quantitative Strategist for DailyFX.com To receive the Speculative Sentiment Index and other reports from this author via e-mail, sign up for his distribution list via this link.
