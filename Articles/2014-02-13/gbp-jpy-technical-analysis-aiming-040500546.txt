Support: 169.35 (50% Fib ret.), 168.05 (38.2% Fib ret.)
Resistance: 170.64 (61.8% Fib ret.), 172.24 (76.4% Fib ret.) The British Pound continues to push higher against the Japanese Yen, with prices poised to extend the rally after breaking the 50% Fibonacci retracement at 169.35. Buyers now aim to challenge the 61.8% level at 170.64, with a break above that aiming for the 76.4% Fib at 172.24. Alternatively, a reversal back below 169.35 targets the 38.2% retracement at 168.05.The pair is trading too close to near-term resistance to make a long position viable from a risk/reward perspective. On the other hand, the short side lacks an actionable reversal signal. We will continue to stand aside for now. Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
