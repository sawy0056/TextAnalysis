WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - February 12, 2014) -
National Disability Institute, the first national non-profit organization dedicated exclusively to building a better economic future for all people with disabilities, applauded President Obama and his administration for the inclusion of workers with disabilities in a historic executive order signed today increasing the minimum wage for workers of federal contractors to $10.10/hour beginning in 2015.Before today's executive order, workers with disabilities employed by federal contractors could be paid less than minimum wage under Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. While today's historic move by the Obama administration extends the higher minimum wage to workers with disabilities employed by federal contractors, Section 14(c) still permits the payment of subminimum wage to hundreds of thousands of workers with disabilities in America's workforce."National Disability Institute wants to express its thanks to President Obama, Secretary of Labor Tom Perez and the Obama administration for taking a major step today to give federal contract workers with disabilities greater access to the economic mainstream by paying them a living wage to advance their financial capability," said Michael Morris, executive director of National Disability Institute."We stand with our fellow members in the Collaboration to Promote Self-Determination in thanking the Obama administration for its dedication to opportunity for all and for encouraging the Administration to work with the disability community to extend greater economic opportunity to all workers with disabilities by urging Congress to repeal Section 14(c)," Morris added.On Feb. 4, 2014, National Disability Institute joined its fellow members of the Collaboration to Promote Self Determination (CPSD) -- a coalition of 21 like-minded disability rights groups -- and sent a letter to President Obama and U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Tom Perez calling on the Administration to include workers with disabilities in the president's State of the Union announcement to raise minimum wage standards for all federally contracted workers. The letter was part of the national push by disability groups and individuals nationwide that led to today's historic executive order.Story continuesAbout National Disability InstituteNational Disability Institute (NDI) is a national non-profit organization dedicated to building a better economic future for people with disabilities.
