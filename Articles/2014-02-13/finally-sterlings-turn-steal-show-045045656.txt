And currency analysts forecast further gains as markets position for higher interest rates from the U.K.(Read more:
BoE's Carney unveils 'next phase' of forward guidance )"We're already pricing in a lot of potential hiking from the Bank of England," Sebastien Galy, senior currency strategist at Societe Generale told CNBC's
Asia Squawk Box ."Some of the growth is slightly unhealthy, but a lot of the pessimism that was there in the U.K. many months ago has reverted so people are bullish," he added.BoE chief Mark Carney on Wednesday unveiled the "next phase" of forward guidance and adopted a less dovish tone than markets had expected. The central bank revised up its 2014 growth forecast to 3.4 percent from 2.8 percent and suggested that interest rates could start to rise from record lows in just over a year.That set the backdrop for stellar currency gains.The sterling, also known as the pound, jumped almost one percent against the dollar on Wednesday and extended those gains on Thursday to $1.6623, its highest level in just over two weeks. Against the euro (Exchange:GBPEUR=), sterling climbed to a three-week high of 0.8176.(Read more:

"In light of recent developments, the market could feel it more appropriate for sterling/dollar to climb towards the middle of that range, which might be as high as 1.8000."Other analysts said sterling appeared to be on track for gains to $1.70, implying a gain of just over 2 percent from current levels."Further gains are likely and we forecast cable [sterling/dollar] will move above $1.70 in coming weeks and months," ANZ Bank said in a note.Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York, said a move to $1.70 was unlikely to be smooth sailing however, with tough technical resistance at $1.6668 and $1.6750.(Read more:
Euro stung by ECB official, sterling jumps on upbeat outlook )Other analysts added that since sterling has already climbed over 10 percent against the dollar since July last year, the pound could make greater headway against the euro."Against the euro, things are more interesting for sterling," said Societe Generale's Galy."That's because on the one side you have some potential tightening in the U.K. and on the other side you have the ECB [European Central Bank] that is trying to push an agenda of easing. So there's clearly a divergence between the two and that is clearly still exploitable," he added.Indeed, ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure was quoted on Wednesday as saying the idea of cutting into negative territory the rate the central bank pays banks to hold their deposits overnight was "a very possible option."-By CNBC's Dhara Ranasinghe.
