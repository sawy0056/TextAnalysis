FFO for the quarter was $63.8 million compared to $60.4 million in the same quarter of 2012. FFO increased by $3.4 million compared to the same quarter in 2012 mainly due to an increase in net operating income of $5.6 million, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative costs of $0.4 million, increase in interest expense of $0.4 million and decrease in interest income of $1.6 million. On a per Unit basis, FFO only increased by 0.9% over 2012, however, excluding a lease termination settlement of $1.9 million received from one large tenant and loan repayment penalty of $1.6 million from the early repayment of two mortgages receivable offset by the large bad debt of $1.0 million which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012, FFO per Unit would have increased by approximately 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2013 over the prior year, reflecting the growing strength of our business.Annual ResultsDuring the year, the Trust acquired three income properties for $102.6 million in cash, adjusted for working capital amounts, totalling 416,589 square feet from third parties.The Trust also acquired four income properties totalling 696,867 square feet for a total of $184.2 million from SmartCentres and Walmart Canada Realty Inc. and formed a 50:50 joint venture with Investors Group Inc. for the purchase of the largest of these properties. The purchase price was satisfied by the issuance of 397,000 Class B Series 6 LP III Units with a value of $10.2 million to SmartCentres and the balance paid in cash and other working capital adjustments.The Trust issued $150.0 million of 3.985% Series I senior unsecured debentures due on May 30, 2023, $150.0 million of 3.385% Series J senior unsecured debentures due on December 1, 2017 and $100,000 of Series K unsecured debentures at a variable rate based on the three month CDOR plus 1.38%, due on October 16, 2015. Proceeds from the issuance of the senior unsecured debentures were used to redeem $75.0 million of 7.950% Series D senior unsecured debentures, acquire investment properties and for general trust purposes.The Trust also obtained $316.7 million in new mortgages with an average term of 11 years and weighted average interest rate of 4.17%.The Trust's debt to gross book value was 51.6% at December 31, 2013 (December 31, 2012 - 48.7%), which is below the Trust's target range, and the debt to total assets ratio was 43.8% (December 31, 2012 - 40.9%). The increases in the debt to gross book value and debt to total assets ratios are primarily due to $400.0 million of senior unsecured debentures issued during the year and new term mortgages described above, which were issued at more favourable interest rates, resulting in an improvement in the interest coverage ratio which increased to 2.5X at December 31, 2013 from 2.3X at December 31, 2012. In addition, properties with an aggregate appraised value of $1,482.8 million are now unencumbered or debt-free. This will provide flexibility to the Trust to address its committed obligations and to grow its portfolio in future years.Story continues

FFO for the year (excluding income tax recovery) was $247.1 million compared to $226.9 million in 2012. The increase of $20.2 million is primarily due to an increase in net operating income of $15.6 million and decrease in interest expense net of yield maintenance on early redemption of unsecured debentures and penalty on early repayment of term mortgages of $5.9 million partially offset by an increase in general and administrative costs of $0.7 million. On a per Unit basis, FFO increased by 3.4% over 2012.The high occupancy level of 99.0%, as well as the Trust's acquisition and development program, generated rental revenue of $573.0 million during the year.
