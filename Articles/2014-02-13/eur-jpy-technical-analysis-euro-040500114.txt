Our decision to pass on a long trade setup yesterday proved prudent: prices reversed lower, forming a Bearish Engulfing candle setup and hinting at further weakness ahead.Near-term support is at 138.06, the 23.6% Fibonacci expansion, with a break below that targeting the 38.2% level at 136.68. Near-term resistance is at 140.29, the February 11 high. Prices are too close to support to make a short trade here palatable from a risk/reward perspective and we will stand aside for now.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer.
