TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Apr 8, 2014) -
Tuckamore Capital (TX.TO)(TX-DBB.TO) ("Tuckamore" or "Company") today announced that its board of directors (the "Board") has approved the adoption of a shareholder rights plan (the "Rights Plan"), effective immediately, subject to acceptance by the Toronto Stock Exchange.The Rights Plan is designed to encourage the fair treatment of Tuckamore's shareholders should a take-over bid be made for Tuckamore by providing the Board and the shareholders with more time to evaluate any unsolicited take-over bid and, if appropriate, to pursue alternatives to maximize shareholder value. The Rights Plan has not been adopted in response to any specific proposal to acquire control of Tuckamore.The Rights Plan is effective immediately, but it must be ratified by shareholders of Tuckamore within six months. Shareholders will be asked to ratify and approve the Rights Plan at the next annual and special meeting of shareholders of Tuckamore (the "Meeting"). If ratified, the Rights Plan will remain in effect until the close of business on the date of termination of the annual meeting of shareholders in 2017, subject to earlier termination or expiration of the Rights Plan in accordance with its terms. If the Rights Plan is not ratified at the Meeting, all rights issued pursuant to the Rights Plan and the Rights Plan will terminate and be null and void and of no further force and effect.The Rights Plan is similar to rights plans adopted by other Canadian corporations. Subject to the terms of the Rights Plan, the rights issuable under the Rights Plan will become exercisable where a party, together with any parties related to it, acquires or announces its intention to acquire 20% or more of Tuckamore's outstanding shares without complying with the "Permitted Bid" provisions of the Rights Plan or without approval of the Board. Rights holders (other than the acquiring person and related persons) can purchase shares of Tuckamore at half the prevailing market price at the time the rights become exercisable.The Rights Plan is not intended to prevent take-over bids. Under the Rights Plan, a bid that, among other things, is made to all shareholders on identical terms and conditions and that is open for at least 60 days may constitute a "Permitted Bid".The Rights Plan is available at www.sedar.com or on request from the Company.About the CompanyTuckamore has investments in 7 businesses representing a diverse cross-section of the Canadian economy.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements Certain information included in this Press Release may constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws.
