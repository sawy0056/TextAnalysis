The Company's consolidated net revenue increased 2.4% to $2.28 million for the three months ending June 30, 2013, compared with $2.23 million for the same period in 2012. The increase in net sales was attributable to continued expansion into mass-market retail, along with the introduction of iSatori's new category-defining product, Bio-Gro™. The Company has begun to aggressively market and promote its brand as it expands distribution into mass-market retail.In the most recent quarter, after taking the effect of a favorable $194 thousand income tax benefit, the Company reported positive net income of $133 thousand for the three months ending June 30, 2013, compared to a net loss of $252 thousand for the same period in 2012. Prior to taking the effect of the income tax benefit, the Company reported a loss before income taxes of $61 thousand for the three months ending June 30, 2013, compared to a loss of $394 thousand for the same period in 2012. The Company's profitability has been impacted by recently induced aggressive marketing and promotion of its brand, investing over $1.2 million year-to-date in mass media marketing activities, which will remain commensurate with expanded distribution into mass-market retail."We remain optimistic about the growth prospects available to the Company during the remainder of 2013 and throughout 2014," stated Stephen Adele, Chief Executive Officer of iSatori, Inc. "Our optimism revolves around the strategic initiatives we began implementing during the first half of 2013, including expansion into mass-market retail outlets and further research and development efforts to fuel future product launches."Recent Company developments include:During the second quarter of 2013, iSatori launched its new, category-defining product Bio-Gro™ Protein Synthesis Amplifier, powered by Bio-Pro Bio-Active Peptides™, which is now protected by USPTO patent file number 61/832,610.
iSatori achieved a significant breakthrough in the "mass market" with its entry into Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, which is now carrying the Company's time-released Energize™ tablet product nationwide in the "energy section" of its nutritional supplements department. Additionally, Walgreens, the nation's largest drugstore retailer is prominently displaying the Energize product in over 6,000 of its drugstores throughout the United States.
To augment its national mass-market distribution of Energize, iSatori began airing a national TV and Internet ad campaign on a number of prominent websites and stations, including TLC, Comedy Central, MTV, DIY, The Travel Channel, and ESPN News, among others.
The Company also noted that its $1.17 million operating line of credit with CoBiz Bank of Colorado expired on July 12, 2013. CoBiz Bank has extended the Company's line of credit for 90 days under the same terms and conditions.
The Company engaged as its auditors the accounting firm EKS&H, the largest accounting firm based in Colorado, which has extensive experience in the nutritional supplements sector.
The Company launched its newest website, Biogeneticlabs.com, in June, to sell the Biogenetic Laboratories line of leading weight-loss supplements directly to consumers. The product line is also sold by specially retailers, such as GNC and Vitamin Shoppe, and online retailers, including Drugstore.com and Groupon.
In June, the Company hired industry veteran and the former VP of Sales/General Manager at nutritional supplements company EAS (now owned and operated by Abbott Laboratories), Rick Anderson, as its Executive Vice President of Sales. Mr. Anderson has over 20 years of proven sales and marketing experience with nutritional supplements and consumer packaged goods companies. Mr. Adele went on to say, "We continue to stay the course regarding our strategic initiatives to accelerate research and development activities, protect our intellectual properties, and introduce multiple new innovative products annually. Also, although delayed in our planned entry by six months, in June 2013 we achieved a significant breakthrough in our 'mass-market' initiative with our entry into Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, and Duane Reade, one of America's most respected drugstore chains. By driving awareness of our brand and purchases of our products through continued marketing programs and sales promotions, our objective is to aggressively pursue the mass-market channel, which is responsible for more than 70 percent of the annual $30 billion market for nutritional supplements in the U.S."Forward-Looking StatementsStatements made in this news release relating to the Company's future sales, expenses, revenue, product developments, and all other statements except statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
