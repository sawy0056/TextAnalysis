(a) - Since operations at the Company's Zaruma Gold Project are in the pre-commercial phase, the proceeds from the sale of precious metals, net of production expenses and taxes, are credited to mine development costs and not recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of operations as permitted under International Financial Reporting Standards.
Production and SalesFor the six months ended June 30, 2013, the Company received proceeds of $17.2 million from the sale of approximately 11,000 ounces of processed gold and 27,000 ounces of processed silver derived from intermittent operations at its processing plant in Zaruma during the continued development of the Zaruma mines.Subsequent to June 30, 2013, and up to the date of this news release, the Company exported approximately 2,800 ounces of gold and 13,400 ounces of silver with an aggregate approximate value of $3.9 million.MiningThe Company continues to concentrate development activities on the main mine "Cabo de Hornos" which provides the best access to the in situ resource. To date, a significant amount of the material mined has come from old workings, generally not included in the Company's resource estimate, using hand held drilling and trackless mining methods. The Company is currently mining and delivering to the plant an average of approximately 450 tonnes of resource and non-resource material of varying grades per day.During the current year the Company has been able to sufficiently dewater the decline at "Cabo de Hornos" to the current mine level and recommence the decline development in this area. The Company expects to be required to continue dewatering as the decline progresses downwards. However the volume of water to be removed is expected to be less as the Company moves beneath the abandoned mine workings.The advance of the declines in the current year has allowed the Company to start accessing and mining higher grade areas contained in the Company's resource, particularly the Matalanga vein resulting in an increase in the average grade of the material mined and delivered to the plant, compared to the second half of last year.Furthermore, the Company has been able to cut across the upper levels of other high grade veins which are within the Company's resource, including the Soroche, Sucre and Tamayo veins with testing of these veins meeting the Company's expectations with respect to grade and width at the current level. The Company is now working to drive the declines below these higher grade veins during the current year which will allow for the commencement of the development and mining of these veins. This outlook is based on current operations, mine plans and exploration results, which are subject to change and cannot be assured (see "Critical Risk Factors" of the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis, dated August 13, 2013, which is available at www.sedar.com).Mining Law AmendmentsIn mid-July, 2013 the Ecuadorian Government published amendments to the Mining Law in the official registry. The significant improvements to the mining law include:The creation of a new medium scale mining license for underground mining operations mining between 300 to 1,000 tonnes per day ("tpd") per concession. Operations that qualify for the medium scale mining license are required to pay a 4 % net smelter return ("NSR") royalty and are not required to enter into an exploitation contract with the Ecuadorian government, meaning that these operations are exempt from all windfall tax provisions;The reconfirmation of the inclusion of the small scale mining licenses for underground mining operations mining up to 300 tpd per concession. Operations that qualify for the small scale mining license are required to pay a 3 % NSR royalty and are not required to enter into an exploitation contract with the Ecuadorian government, meaning that these operations are also exempt from all windfall tax provisions;Large scale mining operations that mine in excess of 1,000 tpd per concession will have fixed NSR royalties between 5% and 8% and will have to negotiate an exploitation contract on a company by company basis with the Government. The easing of investment terms, will allow large scale mining companies to recover their investment before being subject to any windfall tax;The reduction of the number of permits required for every mining phase and the introduction of fixed timeframes that the Government agencies are required to adhere too when processing these applications. These improvements are expected to streamline the permitting process in the future; and Tougher sanctions for illegal mining, which include the confiscation of machinery and strong economic sanctions.About Dynasty Metals & Mining Inc.Dynasty Metals & Mining Inc. is a Canadian based mining company involved in the exploration and development of mineral properties in Ecuador.The Company's properties include the developing Zaruma Gold Project, at which the Company is engaged in intermittent production, the advanced-stage Jerusalem Project, and a highly prospective exploration project, the Dynasty Copper-Gold Belt, which includes the advanced-stage Dynasty Goldfield.For further information regarding the Company's Zaruma Project readers should refer to the Company's Independent Technical Report entitled "Independent Preliminary Assessment - Zaruma Project - El Oro Province" dated August 21, 2006, available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.Story continuesLuis Bravo, a member of AUSIMM (Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy) and a "qualified person" within the definition of that term in the National Instrument 43-101, has supervised the preparation of the technical information contained in this news release.For further information please visit the Company's website at www.dynastymining.com.Forward-Looking InformationThis news release contains statements which are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking information" and which are prospective in nature, including, without limitation, statements regarding Dynasty's future plans and expectations relating to the Cabo de Hornos mine and the process of accessing higher grades of precious metals as the Company advances through declines. Forward-looking information is not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations, beliefs, assumptions, estimates and forecasts about the business and the industry and markets in which the Company operates, including assumptions relating to the Company's ability to continue progress through its declines with minimal or no interruption, that the Company will be able to continue its progress in respect of its mines as planned, that the Company will continue to sell processed gold and silver at levels that allow it to fund the continued development of its mining projects, that the Company will have access to capital if required, that all necessary approvals and arrangements will be obtained and/or finalized in a satisfactory manner in order to continue developing the Company's projects, and that the Company's equipment will operate at expected levels. Often, but not always, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "plans", "expects", "estimates", "forecasts", "projects", "intends", "anticipates" or "believes", or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results "may", "could", "should", "would", "might" or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved.
