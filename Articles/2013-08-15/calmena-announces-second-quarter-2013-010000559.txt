2013 HEADLINESFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the Company recorded revenue of $28.1 million and $67.6 million and EBITDAS of negative $2.1 million and positive $2.2 million respectively compared to revenue of $34.2 million and $83.3 million and EBITDA of $2.0 million and $11.8 million respectively for the comparable periods in 2012. The decreases in the period were the result of decreases in activity in all segments except MENA, and several onetime charges totaling $2.3 million for relocating a drilling rig from Colombia to Texas, disputed customer invoices in Colombia and Libya and a labour settlement in Libya.
As part of the ongoing process to identify, examine and consider a range of strategic alternatives available to the Company with a view to enhancing shareholder value the Company completed several transactions and used the cash proceeds to reduce corporate debt:
In April 2013, Calmena completed the disposition of its wireline technologies service line for cash proceeds of $12.1 million.
During the second quarter of 2013 Calmena divested of certain Canadian contract drilling assets for total proceeds of $3.4 million. Proceeds were comprised of $1.4 million in cash and $2.0 million in settlement of other payables.
In July 2013, Calmena completed the disposition of its remaining Canadian contract drilling assets for cash proceeds of $15.0 million.
Net debt* as at June 30, 2013 was $40.7 million. Proforma net debt, after giving effect to the sale of its remaining Canadian contract drilling assets, would be $25.7 million.
During the second quarter, the Company recorded impairment losses of $25.4 million on certain contract drilling assets. At June 30, 2013 the Company identified indicators of impairment on certain contract drilling assets related to contract cancellations and local market conditions. As a result, the Company assessed the recoverable amount of these contract drilling assets based on estimated fair value less cost to sell ("FLS"). Based on the FLS, the Company recorded impairment losses of $25.2 million and $0.2 million in its Latin America and Canada reportable segments, respectively.
* see non-GAAP measures of this report for description of this term.OUTLOOKIn Canada, equipment rentals and frac fluids are seeing increased activity from its Sundre and Valleyview locations due to their proximity to major resource plays. As a result, we are beginning to see improvements in service and fluid handling revenue, even with the weighting of sales shifting from higher revenue oil based applications to water fracs.The US showed significant revenue and margin improvements in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2013, as activity picked up with our customers in Oklahoma and we executed on a contract with a major independent in west Texas. We are forecasting utilization to continue to improve and margins to stabilize in both Oklahoma and west Texas throughout the remainder of 2013.Budgetary issues between Pemex and the Mexican government resulted in a suspension of drilling operations in Chicontepec for all contractors that was implemented in May of 2013. As a result, all five of our drilling contracts in Mexico were terminated in the second quarter of 2013. In addition, previously announced tender rounds for production sharing agreements ("PSA"s) and integrated services agreements ("ISA"s) have been delayed which will delay related spending. While we continue to have discussions with customers about potential work in other areas of Mexico we believe that activity could remain low for most of the remainder of 2013.In Colombia our directional services business is currently working for one customer and has successfully completed a test program with a second customer that we believe will result in additional awarded work for this customer. During the second quarter we discontinued contract drilling operations in Colombia and relocated the drilling rig to Texas to consolidate with our Mexico Fleet.In Brazil, our heli-portable drilling rig contract was terminated and is racked in one of our yards in Brazil. Currently none of our five rigs is working in Brazil. We are rationalizing costs and marketing all of these rigs in Brazil and elsewhere.In Libya there is continued uncertainty as to 2013 drilling plans in the Waha field. One of our rigs is operating under a contract that extends until the middle of the fourth quarter of 2013. The second rig is currently without a contract after being idle since February 2013 as a result of labour issues. We reached an agreement on our labour issues late in the second quarter and are working to secure a new contract for the rig.ABOUT CALMENA ENERGY SERVICES INC.Calmena is a diversified energy services company that provides well construction services to its customers operating in Canada, the United States, Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa.

As a result, the method of calculation may not be comparable with other companies. This measure should not be considered alternatives to net loss and net loss per share as calculated in accordance with GAAP:EBITDAS (Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other items of income and expense and share based compensation) - Management believes that EBITDAS as derived from information reported in the unaudited condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations is a useful supplemental measure as it provides an indication of the Company's ability to generate funds by the Company's core business activities prior to consideration of how those activities are financed, the impact of foreign exchange, how the results are taxed, how funds are invested or how non-cash depreciation and amortization charges affect results. See the reconciliation of EBITDAS to net loss in the Company's management's discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.Funds flow from continuing operations: Management believes that in addition to cash generated from operations, funds flow from operations is a useful supplemental measure because it provides an indication of the funds generated by the Corporation's principal business activities prior to the consideration of working capital, which is primarily made up of highly liquid balances. See the reconciliation of funds flow from operations in the Company's management's discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.Net debt: Management believes that net debt is a useful supplemental measure because it provides an indication of the Company's leverage compared to liquid assets. Net debt is computed by taking current assets less current liabilities and long-term borrowings and debt. See the calculation of net debt in the Company's management's discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.The TSX has not reviewed and does not accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.
