Trading the News: European Central Bank Interest Rate DecisionWhat’s Expected:Time of release: 04/04/2013 11:45 GMT, 7:45 EDTPrimary Pair Impact: EURUSDExpected: 0.75%Previous: 0.75%DailyFX Forecast: 0.75%Why Is This Event Important:Although the European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.75% in April, the Governing Council may adopt a more dovish tone for monetary policy as the region faces a prolonged recession. As the persistent weakness in the euro-area threatens price stability, ECB President Mario Draghi may show a greater willingness to implement another rate cut in the coming months, and the central bank may have little choice but to carry out its easing cycle throughout 2013 as the region struggles to return to growth.Recent Economic DevelopmentsThe Upside

The sharp rebound in retail sales paired with the stickiness in inflation may prompt the ECB to endorse a more neutral outlook for monetary policy, and the central bank may remain on the sidelines as it still expects the euro-area economy to come out of the recession later this year. However, record-high unemployment along with the ongoing contraction in manufacturing and service-based activity may further dampen the outlook for price stability, and a growing number of central bank officials may push for a rate cut in an effort to steer the region out of recession.Potential Price Targets For The Rate DecisionForex_EURUSD-_Trading_the_European_Central_Bank_ECB_Rate_Decision_body_ScreenShot128.png, EUR/USD- Trading the European Central Bank (ECB) Rate DecisionMoreAs the EURUSD struggles to push back above the 200-Day SMA (1.2880), the pair may preserve the range-bound price action going into the ECB interest rate decision, but the downward trending channel dating back to February may continue to take shape should the central bank sound more dovish this time around. As the euro-area remains mired in recession, the Governing Council may show a greater willingness to further embark on its easing cycle, and we may see the EURUSD continue to give back the rebound from November (1.2659) as the central bank preserves its one and only mandate to ensure price stability.How To Trade This Event RiskTrading the given event risk may not be as clear cut as some of our previous trades as the ECB sticks to its current policy, but the fresh batch of central bank rhetoric may set the stage for a long Euro trade should the Governing Council remain upbeat on the economy. Therefore, if President Draghi strikes a more neutral tone for monetary policy and talks down bets for a rate cut, we will need a green, five-minute candle following the statement to generate a buy entry on two-lots of EURUSD. Once these conditions are met, we will set the initial stop at the nearby swing low or a reasonable distance from the entry, and this risk will establish our first objective. The second target will be based on discretion, and we will move the stop on the second lot to cost once the first trade hits its mark in an effort to secure our profits.In contrast, the Governing Council may adopt a more cautious tone for the region as the region remains at risk of a prolonged recession, and we may see a growing number of ECB officials show a greater willingness to ease policy further in order to stem the downside risks for growth and inflation. As a result, if Mr. Draghi shows a greater willingness to push the benchmark interest rate to a fresh record-low, we will carry out the same strategy for a short euro-dollar trade as the long position mentioned above, just in the opposite direction.Impact that the European Central Bank Interest Rate Decision has had on EUR during the last meeting

Although the initial reaction to the rate announcement was fairly muted, the fresh batch of central bank rhetoric propped up the EURUSD, with the pair ended the day at 1.3107.--- Written by David Song, Currency AnalystTo contact David, e-mail dsong@dailyfx.com.Follow me on Twitter at @DavidJSongTo be added to David's e-mail distribution list, please follow this link.Risk management is key to successful trading.
