Rashers, " North America's Only Bacon Sandwich Shop," is a small business based in Toronto, with one location and a no-frills, bacon-only menu .Founders John Clark and Richard Mulleny have adopted all the usual social media gimmicks: daily Twitter and Facebook updates from the store advertise promotions in which customers can answer trivia questions for in-store discounts.And they have a knowing logo (that's the helvetica typeface, much favored by hipsters, in case you didn't know).It's Rashers' mobile strategy, however, that really brings home the bacon. If customers can prove — via a smartphone app —  that they have traveled a route around Toronto in the shape of a pig, they can claim 30 percent off their next order.Rashers also uses more traditional marketing techniques: The restaurant recently posted fliers featuring tear-off strips (of "bacon," naturally), offering a free bacon sandwich for anyone who brought one in.More From Business Insider TV Will Reach 'Tipping Point' in 2014 As 50% Of Americans Watch OnlineFacebook Is In Danger Of Becoming Yahoo Because Advertisers Don't Understand 'Social'New Pictures Reveal Clues To 'Mad Men' Season 6 Premiere
