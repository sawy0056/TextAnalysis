EUR/USD Technical Analysis – Prices put in a bearish Dark Cloud Cover candlestick pattern below resistance in the 1.3416-51 area, marked by the June 19 high and the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion. The setup hints a move lower is ahead. Negative RSI divergence bolsters the case for a downside scenario. Near-term support is in the 1.3286-1.3301 region, the intersection of a rising channel bottom and the 23.6% Fib retracement, with a break below that targeting the 38.2% level at 1.3185.
