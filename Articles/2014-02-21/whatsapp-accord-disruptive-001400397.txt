Facebook's (FB) $19 bil bid for popular messaging app WhatsApp on Wed. could roil its relationships with wireless phone carriers. Messaging apps like WhatsApp let users send text messages via Internet, bypassing text services sold by wireless firms such as Verizon Communications (VZ), AT&T (T) and Sprint (S). Jefferies said in a report the 19 bil messages and 600 mil photos sent each day via WhatsApp nearly equal the entire telecom industry, which is around a $100 bil business. Facebook shares rose 2.3% to 69.63. Verizon rose 3.4% to 48.12.
