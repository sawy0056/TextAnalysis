CHICAGO, IL--(Marketwired - Dec 1, 2013) - RSNA 2013 -- BridgeHead Software, a leader in healthcare data management, today announced BridgeHead Deduplication for Backup and Recovery along with integrated support for HP StoreOnce Backup. Ideally suited for hospitals that need to move some or all of their backup copies to a remote Disaster Recovery (DR) location, BridgeHead's new deduplication capabilities help lower storage costs and administrative burdens while simultaneously freeing up floor space in the primary datacenter.BridgeHead with embedded HP Catalyst software supports inline data reduction at the backup source, before the backup copy is written to disk. The disk target can be local to the hospital application, or it can be available over a wide-area network (WAN) connection at a remote site. Many hospitals will find it beneficial to combine the use of local and remote storage, to gain the benefits of local recovery of more recent data together with disaster recovery protection at a remote site. Key features include:Reduce the storage space required for BridgeHead backup copies of data at typically 20:1 ratios, and reduce floor space consumed in the hospital by storageImprove the RPO/RTO with online de-duplicated disk storesOptimize network use to enable remote disaster recovery protection replacing tape rotationFree disk space and extend the life of expensive storage systemsDeploy with flexible options for use with any brand of storageEnable backup to cloud, whether at a remote hospital site or third-party cloud provider with the integrated use of HP StoreOnce BackupEncrypt deduplicated data at rest as part of the solutionDeduplicate any BridgeHead backup for maximum advantages"Our work with hospitals always involves seeking efficiencies that we can bring to the table for our clients," said Jack Margossian, President of Comport Healthcare Solutions. "We anticipate that BridgeHead's integration with HP's StoreOnce Catalyst will be very helpful in reducing bandwidth requirements for cloud or remote site backups, lowering costs, and enhancing disaster recovery capabilities."Story continues"BridgeHead Deduplication for Backup and Recovery is ideal for hospitals that want to implement effective disaster recovery strategies without breaking the bank," said Tony Cotterill, chairman and CPO, BridgeHead Software. "It also positions hospitals to take advantage of new cloud storage options, whether they be within the firewall or beyond.""Healthcare providers need to ensure that patient data is securely stored and always available, even in the event of a disaster," said Patrick Osborne, director of product management and marketing, storage, HP. "HP StoreOnce Backup enables BridgeHead to deliver improved backup system performance and data recovery times, enabling 24/7 availability of data and high quality patient care."Working with HP BridgeHead supports its virtual deduplication appliance in deployments with HP StoreOnce Backup equipment, or in use with existing storage depending on what is required by a hospital.Interactive ResourcesCome see BridgeHead and HP at RSNA 2013: BridgeHead will be exhibiting in booth 4573, in South Hall A.Read the product sheet: BridgeHead Deduplication for Backup and RecoveryRead the product page: BridgeHead Deduplication product with HP StoreOnce BackupAbout BridgeHead SoftwareWith 20 years' experience in data and storage management, and 12 years in healthcare, BridgeHead Software is trusted by over 1,000 hospitals worldwide.
