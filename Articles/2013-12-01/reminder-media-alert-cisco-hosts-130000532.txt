The organization seeks to engage individuals and institutions in Bangalore and San Francisco in building sustainable 21st century cities through environmental, technological, and cultural ideas, techniques and resources.Currently, the city of San Francisco prohibits the use of public funds for mayoral trips abroad for the purpose of fostering trade. Sister city organizations seek to fill that gap and often play an important and vital role in organizing endeavors and fostering relationships of this kind.The trade mission on December 1 to 4 will be the first trip to Bangalore by San Francisco's current mayor, Edwin M.
