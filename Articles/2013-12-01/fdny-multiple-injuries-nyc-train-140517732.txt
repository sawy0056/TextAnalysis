The train left Poughkeepsie at 5:54 a.m. and was due to arrive at 7:43 a.m. at Grand Central Terminal, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said in a news release.The train appeared to be going "a lot faster" than usual as it approached the curve coming into the station, passenger Frank Tatulli told WABC-TV.The Fire Department of New York said 130 firefighters are on the scene. The extent of the injuries is not yet clear, the MTA said.Four or five cars on the seven-car train derailed about 100 yards north of the station, the MTA said. But none of the cars entered the Hudson or Harlem rivers, which are adjacent, the MTA said.The crash was reported by the engineer, and it wasn't clear if any crew members are injured, the MTA said.Edwin Valero was in an apartment building above the accident scene when the train derailed. He says none of the cars went into the water where the Harlem River meets the Hudson, but at least one ended up a few feet from the edge.At first, he said, he didn't notice that the train had flipped over."I didn't realize it had been turned over until I saw a firefighter walking on the window," he said.
