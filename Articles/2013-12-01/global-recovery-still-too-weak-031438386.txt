South Korea is Asia's fourth-largest economy and home to the world's biggest suppliers of smartphones and ships."Global trade will likely remain weak, at least through the first two quarters of next year, because any recovery in the big economies will mostly be led by consumption of small items instead of machinery and investment goods," Park said.World Trade Organisation (WTO) data shows imports by the United States fell 0.7 percent for the January-September period from a year earlier, while the European Union countries imported 4.1 percent less from outside the bloc. Chinese imports grew 7.3 percent.Trade ministry data showed South Korea's imports fell 0.6 percent in November on an annual basis, weaker than even the worst forecasts from the Reuters survey and underscoring depressed domestic demand.Robust exports and imports performance in October, up 7.2 percent and 5.2 percent on the year, respectively, had stirred hopes global demand was recovering ground, thanks to the U.S. recovery and stabilizing confidence in Europe.South Korea's economic growth is expected to pick up to 2.8 percent this year from 2.0 percent last year and further to 3.8 percent next year, the central bank has forecast.(Editing by Clarence Fernandez)
