ssi_usd-chf_body_Picture_11.png, Swiss Franc Forecast to Strengthen FurtherMoreUSDCHF –Retail forex trading crowds have remained steadily net-long the US Dollar (ticker: USDOLLAR) versus the Swiss Franc since it crossed below SFr 0.9500, and indeed long interest has grown since last week. Trade Implications – Two of our sentiment-based trading strategies have sold the USDCHF from SFr 0.9277 and SFr 0.9257, and a break below 8-month lows near SFr 0.9080 would further solidify our bearish trading bias. --- Written by David Rodriguez, Quantitative Strategist for DailyFX.com To receive the Speculative Sentiment Index and other reports from this author via e-mail, sign up for his distribution list via this link.
