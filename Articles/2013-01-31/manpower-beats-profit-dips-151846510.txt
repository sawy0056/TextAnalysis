ManpowerGroup (MAN), the global leader in the employment services industry, posted stronger-than-anticipated fourth-quarter 2012 results on the back of effective cost management and better gross margin that meet the upper-end of the company’s guidance range. However, earnings per share dropped year over year as the current sluggish macroeconomic environment resulted in soft demand for recruitment services, particularly in Europe, and weighed upon its results.The quarterly earnings of 91 cents a share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents but dropped 7.1% from 98 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. Unfavorable foreign currencies fluctuation hurt the earnings by a penny. Net earnings per share also came ahead of management’s previously provided projection of 72 cents to 80 cents a share.The results fared significantly better than one of its competitors, Robert Half International Inc. (RHI), which recently reported fourth-quarter 2012 earnings of 42 cents a share. Also, this came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and soared 40% from the prior-year quarter earnings of 30 cents.Manpower is now contemplating on exiting lower margin business and venturing into high margin business. The company is also focusing on controlling expense. On the other hand, the ManpowerGroup Solutions business sustained its growth momentum. The demand for the counter-cyclical outplacement services portrayed signs of steadiness, which increased 16% during the quarter. Canada, U.K., China and India, all contributed to the company’s growth story. Manpower hinted at a mild recovery in the markets in 2013.Let’s Unveil FurtherWhen comparing sequentially, the rate of decline in total revenue of Milwaukee, Wis. based Manpower has decelerated.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 41 cents.First quarter is seasonally tough for Manpower. Consequently, management anticipates first quarter total revenue to decline between 6% and 8% in the U.S. dollars, and at an equivalent rate in constant currency from the prior-year quarter. Management projects revenues in the Americas and APME to remain even or to improve marginally on an average daily basis, and expects to register low-single-digit growth at Right Management. Markets across Europe are expected to remain challenging. However, positive momentum is expected to sustain in the U.K. and Norway.For the quarter, management projects gross profit margin between 16.6% and 16.8%, which reflects a slight year-over-year imporvement but marginally down sequentially. Manpower forecasts operating profit margin in the range of 1.4% to 1.6% compared with 1.8% in the prior-year period.Closing CommentaryWith a well-established network of approximately 3,500 offices in about 80 countries, Manpower currently offers its services to about 400,000 clients.
