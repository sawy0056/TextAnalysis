Crude oil and gold prices may correct downward amid profit-taking following yesterday’s rally as investors brace for Friday’s much-anticipated NFP and ISM data.Talking Points Commodity Prices May Turn Lower Amid Corrective Profit-Taking
Traders Looking Past Quiet Thursday Docket to Friday’s NFP, ISM Commodity prices are in consolidation mode in European trade. A lackluster economic calendar in US hours and absent conviction on the risk sentiment front (as telegraphed by flat S&P 500 futures) point to continued sideways trade ahead as markets brace for Friday’s burst of high-profile event risk. The much-anticipated US Nonfarm Payrolls report as well as the ISM Manufacturing survey are both due to cross the wires. In the meantime, yesterday’s strong rallies may open the door for a correction lower amid profit-taking, leading precious metals as well as crude oil and copper cautiously lower.WTI Crude Oil (NY Close): $97.94 // +0.37 // +0.38%Prices cleared resistance at 97.41, exposing the 100.00 figure and the September 14 high at 100.40.
