ssi_gbp-usd_body_Picture_8.png, British Pound Rallies Offer Short OpportunitiesMoreGBPUSD – Retail FX traders remain long the British Pound against the US Dollar (ticker: USDOLLAR), but recent GBPUSD consolidation has produced similarly sideways moves in crowd sentiment and positioning. Crowds remain near their most net-long GBPUSD since the pair last traded towards multi-year lows at $1.53. Yet long interest has fallen 19 percent since last week. Trade Implications – GBPUSD: Our sentiment-based trading strategies have closed their British Pound short positions. They will once again sell if and when we see a build in crowd long positions and a break lower.--- Written by David Rodriguez, Quantitative Strategist for DailyFX.com To receive the Speculative Sentiment Index and other reports from this author via e-mail, sign up for his distribution list via this link.
