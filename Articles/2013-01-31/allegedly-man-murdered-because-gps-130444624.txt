Rodrigo Abad Diaz, a 22-year-old man, was recently shot and killed after he pulled into the wrong driveway in Lilburn, Ga., Diaz's friends allege. Diaz's friends, who were passengers in the car, say they were trying to pick up another friend to go ice skating but GPS brought them to the wrong house, The Huffington Post's Cavan Sieczkowski reports.As they were waiting in the driveway, the friends say, the homeowner came out with a gun and "just started shooting."The friends say that after 69-year-old Phillip Sailors, the homeowner, fired the first shot, Diaz tried to turn the car around. But that's when Sailors allegedly fired the second shot, which ended up killing Diaz.Sailors' attorney, Michael Puglise, says that since it was late at night, Sailors thought Diaz and his friends were going to invade his home, NBC Latino's Adrian Carrasquillo reports.Police arrested Sailors and charged him for murder, but according to Puglise, Sailors was released on a $10,000 bond yesterday. Puglise told NBC Latino that Sailors is a Vietnam veteran, with no prior criminal history. "You have to understand this is a 69-year-old man who is a military veteran who has been honorably discharged," Puglise told NBC Latino. "He dedicated his life to community service, specifically the Christian Lay Ministry in Latin America."More From Business Insider HTML5 vs. Apps: Here's Why The Debate Matters, And Who Will WinHere's Why Athletes Use Deer Antler SprayThe IAEA Says It Has Inspectors At Iran's Fordo Nuclear Site And There Has Been No Explosion
