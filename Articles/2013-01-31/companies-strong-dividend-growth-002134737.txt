As we’ve written frequently at YCharts, current dividend yield is for chumps – the smart investor looks for long-term dividend growth and sound finances to support that growth.Our recent series, beginning here, covered S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats with the strongest 5-year dividend growth, and the list was topped by Lowe’s (LOW), and included such stellar names as McDonald’s (MCD) , Clorox (CLX) and Wal-Mart (WMT).But suppose the Aristocrats aren’t your thing, and you want to search more widely for dividend growth? No problem. Go to the YChart Stock Screener and choose a list of stocks to survey, say the S&P 500. Then, hitting the “add a financial metric bar,” under “category” hit “cash flows statement.” Under “metric,” hit total common dividends paid.” And under format, choose your time line, such as “Growth: 10 year.” Boom. Now you’ve ranked the S&P 500 by 10-year dividend growth rates. Some of the top-ranked ones will be anomalies, with dividends that rose from nothing during the 10-year period.
