Rating
The company currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.
We believe Helmerich & Payne’s technologically advanced FlexRigs are the key to its success, helping to increase its count of active rigs and maintain relatively strong daily-rate margins even during times of market uncertainty. The company’s proprietary FlexRig design makes the rigs move faster than conventional rigs, drill quicker and more efficiently, and allows for a safer operating environment. As such, these are better suited for the new demands of the exploration business and, therefore, command higher dayrates and utilization than rigs from other land drillers. The company also entered into a deal with 2 exploration and production companies to build and operate three FlexRigs in the U.S.
However, the company’s operations are subject to a number of operational risks, including inclement weather, blowouts and well fires. These hazards could adversely affect Helmerich & Payne’s drilling operations and seriously damage/destroy the equipment involved, thereby reducing the company’s revenues, earnings and cash flows.
But there are certain other companies in the contract drilling service industry that are expected to perform well in the coming one to three months. These include Seadrill Partners LLC (SDLP) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Hercules Offshore Inc. (HERO) and Vantage Drilling Company (VTG) with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  Read the Full Research Report on HPRead the Full Research Report on HERO Read the Full Research Report on VTG Read the Full Research Report on SDLP Zacks Investment Research More From Zacks.com Read the analyst report on HP,HERO,VTG,SDLP
