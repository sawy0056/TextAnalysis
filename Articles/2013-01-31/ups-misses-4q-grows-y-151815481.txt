Our Analysis
Despite the challenging economic conditions, we remain encouraged by UPS' continued productivity gains, improved operating profit, and strong free cash flow position. Despite the failure of its mega Dutch acquisition, TNT Express N.V. (TNTEY), the company remains focused on smaller acquisitions to expand its footprint globally. However, we remain concerned over the volatile economy condition that continues to restrict market demand. Further, the company is also exposed to unionized workforce and intense competition from giants like FedEx Corporation (FDX).UPS retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Read the Full Research Report on UPSRead the Full Research Report on TNTEY Read the Full Research Report on FDX Read the Full Research Report on ATSG Zacks Investment Research More From Zacks.com Read the analyst report on UPS,TNTEY,FDX,ATSG
