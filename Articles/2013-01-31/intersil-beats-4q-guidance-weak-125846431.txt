Revenue

Industrial & infrastructure comprised 57% of Intersil’s sales in the last quarter, down 8.2% sequentially and 13.1% from the year-ago quarter. The fourth quarter marked a continuation of the softening trends noticed in the third, as a result of broad-based weakness and seasonal trends.
Intersil’s Consumer generated 22% of its sales, down 6.8% sequentially and 14.2% from the year-ago quarter due to weakness in the gaming and display markets, partially offset by moderate strength in handheld due to new design wins.

Conclusion
Intersil Corp designs and manufactures high-performance analog, mixed-signal and power components, focused on power management applications. Though the earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company reported an overall disappointing quarter.
In the quarter, the company performed poorly with both revenue and gross margins decreasing from the prior as well as the year-ago quarter. Management gave a weak first-quarter guidance, which reflects low demand visibility, macro weakness and pronounced weakness in analog.
However, we believe that the company’s new products and design wins in the quarter will likely drive demand for light sensor products going forward. We also remain optimistic about Intersil’s long-term prospects and contend that its restructuring activities will reduce fixed cost base and hence reduce operating expenses.
