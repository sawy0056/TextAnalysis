Our View
Alliance Resource Partners was able to secure coal sales commitments for 30.7 million tons, 23.4 million tons and 18.7 million tons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. However, the partnership has failed to come up with any agreement in the lucrative metallurgical export markets for 2013, which will have a negative impact on the average realized price per ton of coal.
The partnership currently retains a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We currently have a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy) on Natural Resource Partners LP (NRP), which is yet to release its fourth quarter results.
