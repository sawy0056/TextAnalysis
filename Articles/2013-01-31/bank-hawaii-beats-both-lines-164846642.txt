Bank of Hawaii Corporation (BOH) reported its fourth-quarter 2012 earnings of 90 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate just by a penny. Moreover, the results compare favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 85 cents. Net income for the quarter came in at $40.3 million, up 3% from the year-ago period.
Better-than-expected results benefited from an increase in non-interest income, rise in loans and deposits as well as a drop in expenses. Yet, the continued low interest rate environment acted as the dampener, affecting the net interest margin as well as the net interest income.
For full year 2012, net income stood at $166.1 million or $3.68 per share, compared with $160.0 million or $3.40 in 2011. This also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.66 per share.
Bank of Hawaii’s revenue reached $153.7 million, up 2% compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a rise in non-interest income, partially offset by a decline in interest income. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $144.0 million.
For the full year, the company’s revenues came in at $620.8 million, down 3% from 2011. However, it compares favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $572.0 million.

Our Take
We believe that the improvement in loan balances and deposits at Bank of Hawaii will serve as a positive catalyst. Well-controlled risk management efforts are also expected to improve its bottom line. Additionally, the company’s capital deployment activities raise investors’ confidence in the stock.
Yet, a low interest environment remains our concern. Also, net interest margin is likely to be under pressure in the upcoming quarters.
