Justin Blair, president of FNF, told Business Insider that as a result of MMA's rise in popularity, Muay Thai, which can be more palatable to some fans, has great potential to gain audience.Friday Night Fights events feature amateurs and pros, with about 10-15 matches per event  – two or more being professional bouts. More often than not, even the pros are not full-time Muay Thai boxers and have side jobs ranging from martial arts instructors to engineers. There are even some prominent bankers among the fighters.We attended the league's opening event for the 2013 season in January to see what the fights and the fighters are all about.Produced by Business Insider VideoMore From Business Insider Here's Why Everyone Is Addicted To CrossFitFacebook Just Added A Button That Lets You Ask Your Friends Why They're SingleFrench Soccer Player Stops On A Wide-Open Breakaway, Scores The Most Obnoxious Goal Possible
