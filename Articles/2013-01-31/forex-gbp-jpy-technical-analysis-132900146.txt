GBP/JPY Technical Analysis- Prices are testing support-turned-resistance at a formerly broken rising trend line set from mid-November (145.05). A reversal downward from here may pave the way to the completion of a Head and Shoulders top. Confirmation of the setup requires a break below support at 139.13, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement. Alternatively, a push higher eyes resistance at 144.79, the January 14 high.Forex_GBPJPY_Technical_Analysis_01.31.2013_body_Picture_1.png, Forex: GBP/JPY Technical Analysis 01.31.2013MoreDaily Chart - Created Using FXCM Marketscope 2.0--- Written by Ilya Spivak, Currency Strategist for Dailyfx.comTo contact Ilya, e-mail ispivak@dailyfx.com.
