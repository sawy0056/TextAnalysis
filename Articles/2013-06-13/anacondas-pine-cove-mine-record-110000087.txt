In the latter half of fiscal 2013, we introduced initiatives to maintain higher consistency in the operations, which manifested themselves in greater output and has set the stage for the coming fiscal year. Since fiscal 2011, year-over-year, the Company has demonstrated the ability to generate better and better operating results as evidenced by fiscal 2013 sales volume being 24% higher than fiscal 2012 and 178% greater than fiscal 2011. With the improvements in Pine Cove's operations and higher projected grade, we expect sales volume in FY 2014 to exceed FY 2013."FY Q4 2013 Mill Operations Overview:The Pine Cove mill processed 84,768 dry tonnes of ore during the fourth quarter, which is the highest quarterly volume achieved to date. The record throughput represented 982 tonnes per operating day, compared to the budgeted amount of 967. The mill operated for 86 days at an availability rate of 93% and an overall gold recovery of 84%, slightly exceeding budgeted expectations. The average head grade of 2.19 grams per tonne, exceeded the 1.99 grams per tonne budgeted for the quarter.

The record throughput performance can be attributed to mechanical improvements in the crusher and an extension in the crushing schedule. The mechanical improvements increased availability and a 24-hour crushing schedule enabled Pine Cove to build and maintain a large crushed ore stockpile during the quarter. These changes provided a more consistent feed for the mill and allowed operations to continue unaffected during any planned or mechanical downtime of the crusher, thus resulting in record throughput for the fourth quarter.At the end of the fourth quarter, Pine Cove initiated a crusher relocation program, which will be completed in Q1 FY 2014. The relocation is meant to further improve consistency in the crusher operations especially during the winter months when the operations are typically hindered more by weather and clean-up issues. Heat coils were installed in the new crusher pad to mitigate snow buildup. The crusher has also been raised to enable easier access for cleaning with heavy equipment. The operation also experimented with a de-icing product in the latter part of last winter which will now become part of routine winter operations. The relocation also allowed for the removal of one high maintenance conveyor belt from the crushing circuit.ABOUT ANACONDAHeadquartered in Toronto, Canada, Anaconda is a growth oriented, gold mining and exploration company with a producing asset located on the Baie Verte Peninsula in Newfoundland, Canada called the Pine Cove mine.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis document contains or refers to forward-looking information.
