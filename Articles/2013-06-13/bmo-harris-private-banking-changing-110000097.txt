MONTREAL, QUEBEC--(Marketwired - Jun 13, 2013) -
According to a study released today by BMO Harris Private Banking, the wealthy of Quebec (those who have investible assets of $1 million or more) are a group of very well educated individuals with 92 per cent having an university education, including 58 per cent holding a professional or graduate level degree. Only 2 per cent have a high school education or less. The study is the first in a series being released by BMO Harris Private Banking over the next year that examines trends among the wealthy across North America."Affluent Quebecers see the value in investing in education and higher learning," said Alan Desnoyers, Vice-President and Managing Director, BMO Harris Private Banking, Quebec. "The link between education and wealth really drives home how critical it is for parents to emphasize to their kids the important role school can play helping them achieve future financial success."Additional regional highlights from the inaugural study include:Sixty-four per cent of Quebecers are self-made, generating the majority of their wealth themselves. Forty-four per cent of the wealthy in Quebec are "new Canadians" having either immigrated to Canada themselves or having at least one parent born outside of the country. One quarter (24 per cent) of the province's affluent are female.Key National Findings:On a national level, the study found the following:Two-thirds (67 per cent) of high-net worth Canadians are self-made millionaires, making their wealth on their own. Only one-in-five (20 per cent) attribute at least part of their wealth to an inheritance. Women make up one-third of Canada's affluent, up from 21 per cent three years ago. Almost half (48 per cent) are either immigrants to Canada (24 per cent), or describe themselves as first generation Canadians with at least one parent born outside of Canada (24 per cent). Education is a big indicator of wealth with 80 per cent of high-net worth Canadians possessing at least a university degree and 46 per cent a graduate or professional degree; 10 per cent have a technical, trade or apprenticeship degree and just 9 per cent hold only a high school diploma or less.
