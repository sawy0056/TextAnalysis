VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jun 13, 2013) -
GoldQuest Mining Corp. (TSX VENTURE:GQC)(M1W.F)(M1W.BE) ("GoldQuest" or the "Company") announces assay results from three in-fill drill holes at La Escandalosa on the Company's 100% owned Las Tres Palmas trend in the Dominican Republic. The holes were from the in-fill program at the La Escandalosa NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource, which is located within the Las Tres Palmas trend 1.5 kilometres south of the Romero discovery (see map of http://goldquestcorp.com/images/press_release/Escandalosa_Plan_Map_June_2013.jpg). The Company is also doing infill drilling at Romero, with the same objective as this program, to increase confidence of the data in advance of any NI 43-101 resource estimate.The 3 holes were sited in consultation with the company's external Qualified Person (QP), B.T. Hennessey, P.Geo., of Micon, designed to provide increased confidence in the continuity of the gold mineralization, and increased data density, with the three hole program providing approximately 25 metre drill spacing in centre of the existing resource.Highlights of these holes include:LTP-141 which contained 28.5 metres grading 10.11 g/t gold (uncut) and 0.31% copper LTP-142 which contained 58.1 metres grading 4.03 g/t gold (uncut) and 0.21% copper
Including 30.0 metres grading 7.69 g/t gold (uncut) and 0.37% copper
LTP-139 which contained 21.1 metres grading 4.58 g/t gold (uncut) and 0.24% copper"The strong gold results are located close to surface, and remind us of the potential of La Escandalosa, particularly in the context of the adjacent Romero discovery" commented GoldQuest President and CEO Julio Espaillat. "The grade of both La Escandalosa and Romero gives us confidence in the potential of the complete Las Tres Palmas trend. Drilling is ongoing in the area, including the new geophysical targets on the Guama trend."The results from the new holes are summarized in the table below:

The mineralization at La Escandalosa is sub horizontal. The in-fill holes are vertical and the mineralized intervals represent approximate true-widths of the mineralized body. A 15 g/t top cut-off was applied to the gold grade which represents the 99th percentile on a cumulative frequency plot, as outlined in the NI 43-101 Technical Report dated August 14, 2012.The 2012 Inferred Mineral Resources at La Escandalosa of 3.13 million tonnes at 3.14 g/t gold, using a 0.6 g/t gold cut-off, grade contains 316,000 ounces of gold. Subsequent to the data cut off for modeling the resource an additional 14 holes, including the 3 reported herein, have been drilled in the footprint of the existing resource. The company is working with Micon to examine the impact of the additional drilling on the classification and contained metal in the resource to determine if additional drilling is required prior to an updated NI43-101 Mineral Resource estimate.The 3 new in-fill holes intersected similar grades and thickness and near surface mineralized characteristics as the adjacent holes LTP-07, LTP-41 and LTP-69, which were previously press released and details of the intervals are included for comparison in the table below.

In addition, systematic re-assaying of intervals is in progress, to confirm compliance of blanks and duplicates checks. The Company also reviews results from Certified Standard Reference materials (CRSM or Standards), which are inserted at a rate of 5 per 100 samples. Within the results disclosed herein there were 2 samples from 2 separate batches, which had results outside the recommended tolerances. One was for gold and the other was for copper. The gold failure is not from a mineralized interval and the Company has not requested re-assay of the batch. The batch with the copper failure is being re-assayed.In GoldQuest's drill programs, composite intervals were chosen using a combination of geological criteria and mineralization, averaging around 2 metres core length. The drill core is cut in half with one half of the core sample shipped to ACME Labs by GoldQuest technicians. The remaining half of the core is kept at the company core shack for future assay verification, or any other further investigation. Assays within intervals below the 0.005 g/t detection limit for Au were given a zero value. All drill samples were prepared and screened by ACME Labs (Santo Domingo); metallic fire assay and multi-element ICP-MS were assayed by ACME Analytical Laboratories (Chile). Gold values are determined by standard fire assay with an AA finish, or, if over 10.0 g/t Au, were re-assayed and completed with a gravimetric finish. QA/QC included the insertion and continual monitoring of numerous standards, blanks and duplicates into the sample stream, at random intervals within each batch.
