SUGAR LAND, TX--(Marketwired - Jun 13, 2013) - Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- One look at the official name of the Ironworkers Union -- the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers -- and you'll realize the importance of this skilled craft and the large number of sectors in which ironworkers are involved.Every day, on the roads we drive, the bridges we cross, and in the buildings and factories where we work, we rely on the skill and expertise of ironworkers. As these facilities and infrastructures are constructed and maintained, three things are universally important: safety, quality and productivity.The Ironworkers Union and the Ironworker Management Progressive Action Cooperative Trust (IMPACT) ensure that these three qualities are consistently met by their apprentices and journeymen. With almost 150 training centers across North America, the Iron Workers and IMPACT provide top-quality training and an awareness of the importance of safety and on-time performance.Each year, the Iron Workers and IMPACT invest more than $50 million in training and upgrading for apprentices and journeymen, as well as another $10 million in safety, technology and job-site training for contractors. Unique, one-on-one relationships with project managers help to identify the specific needs of each project in order to deliver a top-quality product.Click here to join Walter Wise, general president of the Ironworkers Union, and Kevin Hilton, the CEO of IMPACT, along with the host of "Industry Today" to learn more about how these organizations can provide top-of-the-line craftsmanship for your next industrial project.
