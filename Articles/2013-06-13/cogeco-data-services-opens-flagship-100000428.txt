TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Jun 13, 2013) -Editors Note: A photo for this release will be available on the Canadian Press picture wire via Marketwired.Today, Cogeco Data Services, a leading Canadian Information and Communications Technology (ICT) provider, announced the opening of its new multi-million dollar data centre in Barrie just north of Toronto, Ontario. The facility, paired with Cogeco Data Services' wholly-owned cloud and network infrastructure has been designed to support the global acceleration of data that is being fuelled by the increasing demand for cloud and managed services.As enterprise IT departments continue to adopt cloud and managed services, the exponential growth of corporate data will continue to accelerate. Michael Levy, Analyst, Data Centres, 451 Research, explains this trend, "The adoption of cloud and managed services, coupled with increasing pressure by employees bringing their own devices demanding the implementation of new, user-friendly applications, has accelerated the growth of corporate data. The availability of redundant data centre and cloud infrastructure backed by strong network capabilities will be key to an organization's success and for data centre providers such as Cogeco Data Services."Data centre traffic, of which nearly two-thirds will be attributed to cloud computing, is predicted to reach 6.6 zettabytes (the equivalent of 44 billion HD movies) by 20161. To accommodate this rapid growth, organizations must engage a strong data centre and cloud provider that can not only store and manage, but move an extreme volume of data at a rapid pace."In this 'age of acceleration', businesses are exponentially increasing the amount of data they produce and are required to manage increasingly complex IT environments.," said Tony Ciciretto, President, Cogeco Data Services, "Organizations are looking to experienced service providers to help them move, manage and store this influx of information and our new flagship data centre in Barrie paired with our expert technologists and dedicated customer support is an ideal fit to meet this demand."Built to exceed Tier 3 standards and to deliver advanced data centre, cloud, managed IT and connectivity services, the new facility increases Cogeco Data Services' data centre footprint by 60,000 square feet. The sixth location in the Company's growing fleet, the flagship facility is housed in the RCMP's former Security Control Centre for the G8 and G20 summits in 2010, and has state of the art 24/7/365 monitoring, biometric access control, video surveillance and security. Like its other facilities, Cogeco Data Services' Barrie data centre features redundant power supply including dual power feeds, universal power supply and generator backups for reliable continuous uptime. The centre also provides access to advanced hybrid solutions (colocation, cloud and managed data centre services), with business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities.The new data centre, owned, operated and managed by Cogeco Data Services, was designed in partnership with Ehvert Mission Critical, a firm responsible for the design and construction of some of North America's most sophisticated mission critical data centre facilities. The latest in green data centre technologies were employed in partnership with global energy management specialist, Schneider Electric, most notably the first production installation of Schneider Electric's APC Ecobreeze Cooling system in North America. The facility also utilizes Schneider's unique hot aisle containment and monitoring system to maximize efficiency.The new facility has been designed with CSAE 3416 and PCI compliance in mind and will undergo the certification process once the facility has been in operation for the required period of time.1 Cisco Global Cloud Index, 2012About Cogeco Data Services With its suite of ICT solutions (Data Centre, Managed IT, Cloud Infrastructure, Connectivity, Voice and Professional Services), Cogeco Data Services supplies its customers with the fast, reliable and secure ability to access, manage, move and store large amounts of data worldwide.
