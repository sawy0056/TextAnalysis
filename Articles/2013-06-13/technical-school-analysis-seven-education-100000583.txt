NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- School stocks have had a volatile ride in the new millennium, driven mostly by technical momentum, not fundamentals. Today I am profiling seven school stocks. Three peaked in the April 2004 to June 2004 time frame, one in February 2009, and the other three in April 2010.
These stocks have not traded in sync with the overall market volatility. One bottomed in October 2011, two in July 2012, another in November 2012, and the other three in 2013 between January and April. When stocks are this volatile, trading strategies must be based more heavily on the technicals than on the fundamentals.
School stocks are in the consumer-discretionary sector which is 14.6% overvalued. The school industry is just 6% overvalued, and all of these stocks are rated hold according to ValuEngine.

A factor for these stocks is whether the Senate passes a bill that prevents the doubling of the interest rate on student loans. If rates hold steady, school stocks could have an upside trade due to improving technicals.

Apollo Group
($21.69) is poised for a technical rally given daily closes above the 200-day simple moving average at $21.04. This stock peaked at $98.01 in June 2004, and has struggled since then. Apollo traded as low as $15.98 on March 4, and the weekly chart profile stays positive on a close this week above the five-week modified moving average at $21.45. My semiannual value level is $9.88 with a weekly pivot at $21.41 and quarterly risky level at $24.23.

Career Education
($3.04) needs to have a daily close above its 200-day SMA at $3.16 to gather technical momentum. This stock at $3 should be considered an option on survival.

Corinthian Colleges
($2.64) is above its 200-day SMA at $2.34. This stock is trading below $3, and so it too is an option on survival.
