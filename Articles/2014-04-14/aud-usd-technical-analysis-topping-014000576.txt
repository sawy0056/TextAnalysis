Support: 0.9363 (38.2% Fib exp.), 0.9303 (23.6% Fib exp.)
Resistance: 0.9412 (50% Fib exp.), 0.9461 (61.8% Fib exp.) The Australian Dollar put in a Shooting Star candlestick below resistance at 0.9412, the 50% Fibonacci expansion, warning of indecision and hinting a turn lower may be ahead. A break below support at 0.9363, the 38.2% level, targets the 23.6% Fib at 0.9303. Alternatively, a push above resistance on a daily closing basis aims forthe 61.8% Fib at 0.9461.The available range between near-term support and resistance is too narrow to make for an attractive trade setup for a strategy using a stop-loss activated on a daily closing basis (as is the case for our approach) given a 20-day ATR reading of 70. We will remain on the flat for now.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
