The next downside barrier lines up at 101.22, the 61.8% Fibonacci expansion, with a break beneath that targeting the 76.4% level and the February 4 low in the 10054-75 area. Alternatively, a turn back above the channel bottom (101.62) and the 50% Fib at 101.78 aims for the 38.2% expansion at 102.33.The available trading range is too narrow to take a short position and utilize a strategy employing a daily-close activated stop-loss (as is the case for our approach). With that in mind, we will remain flat for the time being.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
