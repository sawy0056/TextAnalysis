Support: 0.8667-75 (Apr’13 high, 23.6% Fib exp.), 0.8513 (Oct 22 close)
Resistance: 0.8762 (38.2% Fib exp.), 0.8839 (50% Fib exp.) The New Zealand may be readying to turn lower against its US namesake after prices put in a bearish Dark Cloud Cover candlestick pattern. Negative RSI divergence bolsters the case for a downside scenario. All eyes are on resistance-turned-support in the in the 0.8667-75 area, marked by the April’13 high and the 23.6% Fib. A daily close below this threshold initially targets the October’13 top at 0.8513. Near-term resistance is at 0.8762, the 38.2% Fib, with a move above that exposing the 50% expansion at 0.8839.Risk/reward considerations argue against entering short with prices trading in close proximity to relevant support.
