HONG KONG, CHINA--(Marketwired - Apr 13, 2014) - Artesyn Embedded Technologies, formerly Emerson Network Power's Embedded Computing & Power business, today announced support for the large scale deployment of applications, such as over the top (OTT) network services and WebRTC gateways, by integrating the latest audio codecs into its PCI Express media processing acceleration card, recently rebranded SharpMedia™ PCIE-8120.The Artesyn™ SharpMedia PCIE-8120 enables network equipment providers to add high density, highly scalable voice and video processing to network applications, while using less space, less power and at lower cost than the alternative of adding more servers or suffering significantly reduced application performance. By including support for the Opus (used by WebRTC) and SILK (used by Skype) audio codecs in the PCIE-8120, Artesyn is helping providers of network applications accelerate their development and deployment in a cost-effective and scalable way.Opus and SILK are open-source, royalty-free, audio codecs designed for interactive speech and music transmission over the Internet, but also ideal for storage and streaming applications. They can handle a wide range of audio applications, including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and remote live music performances."The addition of these codecs underlines our continued development of this innovative product line and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to introduce new technologies into this application space," said Linsey Miller, director of marketing for server acceleration, Artesyn Embedded Technologies. "We are actively monitoring the mandatory video codec discussions happening in the IETF to ensure maximum interoperability for WebRTC-based deployments."Company logo: http://release.media-outreach.com/i/Download/1489About Artesyn Embedded Technologies
