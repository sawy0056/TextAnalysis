Support: 169.86 (38.2% Fib ret.), 168.71 (50% Fib ret.)
Resistance:170.29 (trend line), 171.27 (23.6% Fib ret.) The British Pound may have initiated a major downward reversal against the Japanese Yen after prices took out support at a rising trend line set from August 2013. Sellers are now challenging the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 169.86, with a break below this barrier on a daily closing basis exposing the 50% level at 168.71. Alternatively, a turn back above the trend line (now at 170.29) targets the 23.6% retracement at 171.27.Prices are too close to near-term support to justify entering a short trade from a risk/reward perspective. We will stand aside for now, waiting for an actionable setup to present itself.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
