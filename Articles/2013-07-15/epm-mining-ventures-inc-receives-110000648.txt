TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Jul 15, 2013) -

("EPM" or the "Company") (TSX VENTURE:EPK)(EPKMF) today announced a key decision by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the US Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") determining that there are no Waters of the United States on the Sevier Playa, the site of the Company's Sulfate of Potash Project ("Project") in southwestern Utah. The Corps determined that the Sevier Playa is not a regulated feature under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act ("Act") and as such is exempt from the USACE's permitting requirements under the Act. Therefore, certain federal permits relating to water will not be required.Lance D'Ambrosio, Chief Executive Officer of EPM, said; "We are very pleased with this jurisdictional determination.

The Corps determined that the Sevier Playa is an "intrastate isolated feature" with "no apparent interstate or foreign commerce connection". Given the determination, the Company will be able to conduct the work of developing trenches and evaporation ponds on the Sevier Playa without the need for expensive USACE permitting and associated mitigation.About EPM Mining Ventures EPM, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Peak Minerals Inc., controls directly or through agreement, mineral leases on more than 124,000 acres on the Sevier Playa property in Millard County, Utah.
