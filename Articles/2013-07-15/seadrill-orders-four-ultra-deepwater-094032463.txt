Seadrill orders four new ultra-deepwater drillships for delivery in 2015Theflyonthewall.comJuly 15, 2013, 9:40 AM UTCSeadrill has entered into turnkey contracts to build four new ultra-deepwater drillships. Two drillships will be built at the DSME yard and the other two at the Samsung yard, in South Korea. The project value price is estimated to be below $600M per unit. Delivery of the 4 units is scheduled for the second half 2015. Seadrill has in addition received fixed priced options for delivery of two further units for delivery in the first half 2016. The drillships will have a hook load capability of 1,250 tons and a water depth capacity of up to 12,000 feet targeting operations in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West and East Africa. Also, these units will be outfitted with seven ram configuration of the blowout preventer stack and with storing and handling capacity for a second BOP. The units include design and equipment features, which makes them particularly attractive for development drilling. For two of the drillships, Seadrill has received options to include equipment which makes the units prepared for 20K BOP systems. The board of Seadrill is of the opinion that the current order book for 2014-2016 of approximately 39 units will be fully absorbed, and utilization will continue at very high levels with solid dayrates for the modern equipment. Seadrill currently has an order backlog of approximately $19B. Based on current discussions, we are confident that in the coming months we will add to this as the company's open 2014 capacity is likely to be fixed at attractive day rate levels.Scroll to continue with contentAd
