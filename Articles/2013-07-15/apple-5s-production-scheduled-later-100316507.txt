Jefferies said its channel checks indicate that production of the iPhone 5S, the low cost iPhone, is scheduled to begin later this month. The firm estimates September quarter build plans are likely on the higher-end of its 25M-30M estimate while December quarter build plans are at its 50M-55M estimate. Jefferies views the large build plans as positive, but says the lower cost phone will have negative implications for margins. The firm keeps a Hold rating on Apple shares with a $405 price target.
