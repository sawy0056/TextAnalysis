The Company expects to provide more detailed guidance as part of its second quarter financial reporting. Crocodile Gold maintained consistent gold production compared to the first quarter with lower average grades largely attributable to the treatment of oxide stockpiles at the Stawell Gold Mine. Crocodile Gold is also proud to announce that the Stawell Gold Mine has recently achieved two continuous years of Lost-Time Injury Free operations.Rodney Lamond, the newly appointed incoming President and CEO of Crocodile Gold, commented: "It is encouraging to see that Crocodile Gold is well on its way to meeting the Company's 2013 production objectives. In the coming weeks, I will be in Australia reviewing the operations and working with management to identify areas of opportunity in this difficult gold market."Story continuesOperational UpdatesFosterville Gold Mine (FGM) The Fosterville Gold Mine (FGM) produced 195,686 tonnes from the Harrier and Phoenix zones during the second quarter at an average grade of 4.39 g/t Au. The operation processed 197,769 tonnes of ore at a grade of 4.32 g/t Au with a recovery rate of 85.5%, resulting in gold production of 23,470 ounces for the second quarter. Mine development continued at an average advance rate of 597 metres per month during the quarter.Stawell Gold Mine (SGM) The Stawell Gold Mine (SGM) continues to transition from its underground mining activities and is now focused on the upper levels of the mine to access remnant ounces. During the quarter it mined 94,541 tonnes of underground ore at an average grade of 2.66 g/t Au which it supplemented with surface oxide material for a total of 238,344 tonnes processed at an average grade of 1.20 g/t Au. SGM achieved a recovery rate of 76.5%, which resulted in gold produced of 7,085 ounces. SGM expects to complete underground mining in the third quarter 2013, however, a significantly reduced cost structure has prompted a review of the upper level resource with potential to identify further profitable ounces from the underground operation.Northern Territory OperationsThe Cosmo Mine continues to ramp-up to full production levels, producing 176,110 tonnes of ore during the quarter at an average grade of 3.63 g/t Au out of which approximately 23,000 tonnes was left to be processed as of June 30, 2013. The Union Reefs mill processed 175,708 tonnes during the quarter at an average grade of 3.50 g/t Au and at a recovery rate of 89.5%, resulting in gold production of 17,706 ounces. Recovery issues experienced at the end of Q1 were quickly addressed by site management with recoveries now returning to expected levels around 92%. The Cosmo Mine achieved an average development rate of 449 meters in the quarter, in line with operational requirements while continuing to minimize capital expenditure. Divesting of Non-Core AssetsIn June 2013, the Company completed the sale of the non-core Tom's Gully and Mount Bundy properties to Primary Gold. As a result, A$3M in security bonds were released into the Company's available cash balance and the related rehabilitation liabilities were transferred to Primary Gold. A total of 786km2 were included in the land package.On May 29, 2013, the Company signed a definitive agreement with Pitchblack Resources Ltd. ("Pitchblack") for the option to acquire a 90% interest in a package (260km2) of non-core base metal properties in the Northern Territory in exchange for cash consideration of $500,000 and a 10% common share interest. The option is also contingent on C$4M in exploration expenditures within 4 years of the date of the agreement. Closing of this transaction is subject to Pitchblack receiving approval from the TSX Venture Exchange and certain other conditions.Company OutlookThe Company is currently undergoing a detailed review of all costs and projects and will adjust its plan accordingly to ensure conservation of cash and optimal use of capital. With the significant reduction in debt as a result of unwinding the gold swap contracts earlier this year, Crocodile Gold has significantly strengthened its balance sheet which will allow it to react to changing market conditions. The Company has a positive working capital balance of approximately $20M, which includes a cash balance of approximately $29 M as of June 30, 2013.As a result of the significant decrease in the price of gold, management is assessing the carrying value of its mine properties and property, plant and equipment as the recoverable amount at lower prices may exceed the carrying amount of those assets, which would result in an impairment charge. This assessment is currently ongoing and will be finalized as part of the Company's Q2 financial statements.Conversely, as a result of the lower gold price environment, management also expects to record a decrease in the Company's contingent liabilities, which would result in a gain to the consolidated statement of operations. A significant gain on the unwinding of the gold swap contracts will also be recognized in the Q2 financial statements.About Crocodile Gold Crocodile Gold is a Canadian gold mining and exploration company with three operating mines in the Northern Territory and the State of Victoria, Australia.
