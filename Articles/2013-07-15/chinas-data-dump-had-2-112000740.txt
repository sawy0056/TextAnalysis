First, the year-to-date contribution of gross capital formation rebounded strongly to 4.1ppt from 2.3ppt in Q1 and also a touch higher than the 4ppt in Q2 2012, which nearly offset the 1ppt decline in the contribution from net exports (0.1ppt ytd). Second, nominal GDP growth decelerated much more sharply from 9.6% in Q1 to 8%, as the deflator increased just 0.5% yoy (1.7% yoy in Q1). We find this deflator somewhat too low given the monthly inflation data published over the quarter. In comparison, Q4 2009 had much lower CPI, similar PPI, lower export price inflation and higher import price inflation, but yet the GDP deflator was significantly higher at 1.4% yoy.China unfortunately has a poor reputation for producing consistent data.  But experts note that its the trends that matter.  And the trend is clearly pointed downward.More From Business Insider NOMURA: Chinese Growth Will Fall Below 7% Next YearA Complete Look At China's Latest Economic Data In One ChartThe All-Time High Stock Market Is About To Get Served A Potent Cocktail Of Economic Data And Fedspeak
