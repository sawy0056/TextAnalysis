Forest Oil Corporation announced that, after receiving unsolicited proposals from third parties interested in acquiring Forest’s oil and gas assets located in the Texas Panhandle, Forest’s board of directors has determined that the company will initiate a marketed process to pursue the sale of such assets. Forest has retained J.P. Morgan to assist in the marketing efforts. Forest said it intends to use any proceeds from a potential sale to reduce debt and enhance financial flexibility.
