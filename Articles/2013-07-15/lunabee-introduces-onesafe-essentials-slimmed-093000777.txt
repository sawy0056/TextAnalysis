SINGAPORE and LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 15, 2013) - Lunabee, an innovator of mobile and desktop applications, today announced the release of oneSafe Essentials, the latest addition to the company's expanding suite of ultra-secure password management apps.Lunabee released its flagship app, oneSafe, back in October 2011. It quickly became one of the most popular password management apps on the market. Since then, the company has also released oneSafe Photos and oneSafe for Mac, each to great acclaim.oneSafe Essentials is a slimmed-down, more affordable version of oneSafe. It's designed for users who simply want a safe place to store their personal information without the range of features that comes with the full version of oneSafe. It combines the same impregnable security and intuitive user interface as oneSafe, but with fewer features."We've had extremely positive feedback from users of oneSafe," said Olivier Berni, managing director, Lunabee. "This inspired us to create oneSafe Essentials, a simpler version of the app that's more affordable and accessible to a wider range of users. In other words, more people will now be able to use oneSafe's technology to secure their digital life. We hope they'll enjoy the experience as much as our other users have."Earlier this month, Lunabee announced the integration of TRI-PIN keypad technology into oneSafe. The TRI-PIN keypad is revolutionary new PIN authentication technology that features not only numbers, but also multipliers of colors and symbols. Once a user assigns a PIN, every time that the user authenticates into oneSafe, colors and symbols randomly change position on the TRI-PIN keypad, making the PIN impossible to discover, even if someone is watching the user type. oneSafe Essentials is available immediately for the iPhone for $1.99 and the full version of oneSafe is available for $5.99 with the Mac version for $12.99 on the App Store.
