The consensus estimates for UCTT is doing just what investors want to see, its moving higher.I see small increases for this quarter, next quarter, this year and next year.The Zacks Rank cares the most about the full year number and for 2019 that number has moved from $0.87 to $0.95 over the last 60 days.The 2020 number has moved from $1.29 to $1.40 over the same time period.These are big moves... and investors that believe that fundamentals matter know that higher EPS results lead to higher stock prices.ValuationI see a 16x forward PE mutliple and that is pretty good considering there is 8.6% topline growth on a year over year basis.  I see a price to book multiple that is just under 2x and a price to sales multiple of 0.86x.Chips stocks in general have been very strong and this name should benefit from continued investor interest in the space.ChartUltra Clean Holdings, Inc.
