But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.'So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Xtep International Holdings (HKG:1368). Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. See our latest analysis for Xtep International Holdings Xtep International Holdings's Improving ProfitsEven modest earnings per share growth (EPS) can create meaningful value, when it is sustained reliably from year to year. So EPS growth can certainly encourage an investor to take note of a stock. Like a wedge-tailed eagle on the wind, Xtep International Holdings's EPS soared from CN¥0.22 to CN¥0.33, in just one year. That's a commendable gain of 51%.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Xtep International Holdings's EBIT margins were flat over the last year, revenue grew by a solid 27% to CN¥7.0b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.One shining light for Xtep International Holdings is the serious outlay one insider has made to buy shares, in the last year. Specifically, in one large transaction Founder Shui Ding paid HK$9.7m, for stock at HK$4.84 per share. Big insider buys like that are almost as rare as an ocean free of single use plastic waste.On top of the insider buying, it's good to see that Xtep International Holdings insiders have a valuable investment in the business. Indeed, they hold CN¥185m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 1.8% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.While insiders already own a significant amount of shares, and they have been buying more, the good news for ordinary shareholders does not stop there. The cherry on top is that the CEO, Shui Ding is paid comparatively modestly to CEOs at similar sized companies. I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Xtep International Holdings with market caps between CN¥6.9b and CN¥22b is about CN¥3.9m.Story continuesThe Xtep International Holdings CEO received total compensation of just CN¥957k in the year to December 2018. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance, that arrangement seems generous to shareholders, and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when its reasonable that does give me a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is Xtep International Holdings Worth Keeping An Eye On?Given my belief that share price follows earnings per share you can easily imagine how I feel about Xtep International Holdings's strong EPS growth. Better still, insiders own a large chunk of the company and one has even been buying more shares. So it's fair to say I think this stock may well deserve a spot on your watchlist. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Xtep International Holdings is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.
