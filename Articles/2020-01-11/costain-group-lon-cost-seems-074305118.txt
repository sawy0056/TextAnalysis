It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Costain Group PLC (LON:COST) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Costain Group What Is Costain Group's Debt?As you can see below, at the end of June 2019, Costain Group had UK£89.7m of debt, up from UK£80.4 a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, its balance sheet shows it holds UK£130.5m in cash, so it actually has UK£40.8m net cash.LSE:COST Historical Debt, January 10th 2020MoreHow Healthy Is Costain Group's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Costain Group had liabilities of UK£328.6m falling due within a year, and liabilities of UK£76.6m due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had UK£130.5m in cash and UK£311.1m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast UK£36.4m more liquid assets than total liabilities.This excess liquidity suggests that Costain Group is taking a careful approach to debt. Because it has plenty of assets, it is unlikely to have trouble with its lenders. Succinctly put, Costain Group boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!While Costain Group doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Costain Group's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Costain Group has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Costain Group reported free cash flow worth 16% of its EBIT, which is really quite low. That limp level of cash conversion undermines its ability to manage and pay down debt.Summing upWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Costain Group has UK£40.8m in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. So we are not troubled with Costain Group's debt use. Given Costain Group has a strong balance sheet is profitable and pays a dividend, it would be good to know how fast its dividends are growing, if at all.
