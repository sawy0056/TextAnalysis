But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For example, the Fagron NV (EBR:FAGR) share price has soared 109% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. On top of that, the share price is up 25% in about a quarter. View our latest analysis for Fagron In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Fagron became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).ENXTBR:FAGR Past and Future Earnings, January 10th 2020MoreWe know that Fagron has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Fagron the TSR over the last 3 years was 111%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Fagron shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 8.0% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes.
