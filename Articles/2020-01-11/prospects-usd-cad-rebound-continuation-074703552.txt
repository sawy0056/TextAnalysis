Both of these invalidations are bullish signs.Additionally, the current position of the daily indicators suggests that further improvement is just around the corner.The situation developed in line with the above scenario and USD/CAD managed to break above the upper border of the blue consolidation during yesterday’s session. Earlier today, the pair extended gains, making our long positions even more profitable.As the buy signals continue to support the buyers, this observation of yesterday keeps being still valid:Should this be the case and USD/CAD extends gains from here, the initial upside target will be the previously broken black line – that is the neck line of the head and shoulders formation.We hope you enjoyed reading the above free analysis, and we encourage you to read today’s Forex Trading Alert – this analysis’ full version.
