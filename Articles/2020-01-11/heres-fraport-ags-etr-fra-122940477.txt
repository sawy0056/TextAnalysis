To keep it practical, we'll show how Fraport AG's (ETR:FRA) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. What is Fraport's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 13.23. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying €13.23 for every €1 in prior year profit. See our latest analysis for Fraport How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Fraport:P/E of 13.23 = €72.74 ÷ €5.50 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each €1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Fraport's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (17.5) for companies in the infrastructure industry is higher than Fraport's P/E.XTRA:FRA Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Fraport shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.Fraport increased earnings per share by a whopping 39% last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 18%. I'd therefore be a little surprised if its P/E ratio was not relatively high.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Is Debt Impacting Fraport's P/E?Net debt totals 65% of Fraport's market cap. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you should absolutely keep in mind it has significant borrowings.The Bottom Line On Fraport's P/E RatioFraport has a P/E of 13.2. That's below the average in the DE market, which is 20.6. While the EPS growth last year was strong, the significant debt levels reduce the number of options available to management. The low P/E ratio suggests current market expectations are muted, implying these levels of growth will not continue.Story continuesInvestors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
