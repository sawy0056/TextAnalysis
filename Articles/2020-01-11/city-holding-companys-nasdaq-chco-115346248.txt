We'll show how you can use City Holding Company's (NASDAQ:CHCO) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. City Holding has a P/E ratio of 17.17, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 5.8%. See our latest analysis for City Holding How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for City Holding:P/E of 17.17 = $81.59 ÷ $4.75 (Based on the year to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each $1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does City Holding Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that City Holding has a higher P/E than the average (12.9) P/E for companies in the banks industry.NasdaqGS:CHCO Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that City Holding shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.City Holding's earnings per share grew by -7.1% in the last twelve months. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 7.6% per year over the last five years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does City Holding's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?City Holding has net debt worth just 6.8% of its market capitalization. The market might award it a higher P/E ratio if it had net cash, but its unlikely this low level of net borrowing is having a big impact on the P/E multiple.The Bottom Line On City Holding's P/E RatioCity Holding has a P/E of 17.2. That's below the average in the US market, which is 18.9. The company hasn't stretched its balance sheet, and earnings are improving. The P/E ratio implies the market is cautious about longer term prospects.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
