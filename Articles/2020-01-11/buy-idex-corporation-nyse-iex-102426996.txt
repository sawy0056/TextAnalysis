If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see IDEX's earnings per share have risen 13% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past ten years, IDEX has increased its dividend at approximately 15% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayShould investors buy IDEX for the upcoming dividend? IDEX has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination.
