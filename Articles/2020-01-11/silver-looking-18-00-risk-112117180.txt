Currently, silver is trading at $17.91, down $0.01 or 0.10% on the day.Silver Under Pressure as Iran Tensions EaseThis week’s dramatic events in the Middle East triggered sharp volatility in silver prices, as traders sought safe-haven assets while the crisis was in full swing. On Wednesday, silver prices touched $18.85, a 4-month high, after Iran launched missile attacks on two U.S. military bases in Iraq. Iran had vowed revenge after the U.S. killed a top Iranian general last week, and the Iranian response raised fears of all-out war between Iran and the U.S. However, the Iranian attack appeared calculated to avoid U.S. casualties and caused minimal damage. Investors took this as a signal that Iran was ready to de-escalate the situation, after saving face with an attack against U.S. forces. The ease in tensions restored investor risk appetite and has sent silver prices below the $18.00 level, a line with psychological significance. If risk appetite remains steady, we could see silver continue to slide next week.Investors Eye Nonfarm PayrollsAfter a week which was dominated by the U.S-Iran clash, it’s back to fundamentals on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to drop to 150 thousand, down from 266 thousand a month earlier. However, ADP nonfarm payrolls looked very sharp earlier this week, climbing to 202 thousand, its best showing since April. Wage growth is expected to rise to 0.3%, up from 0.2% in November. Strong employment numbers could further raise risk appetite and send silver prices lower.Silver Technical AnalysisOn the downside, there is support at 17.50, followed by the 50-EMA line at 17.47. On the upside, the round number of 18.00 is an immediate resistance line. This is followed by resistance at 18.60, which is protecting the 19.00 line.XAG/USD 1-Day ChartMoreThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
