(NASDAQ:BRKL) Be Part Of Your Dividend Portfolio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosDividend paying stocks like Brookline Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:BRKL) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends.

During the year, the company also conducted a buyback equivalent to around 0.9% of its market capitalisation.

If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 39% of Brookline Bancorp's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Brookline Bancorp's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Brookline Bancorp has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having been cut one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.74 in 2010, compared to US$0.46 last year. This works out to be a decline of approximately 4.6% per year over that time. Brookline Bancorp's dividend hasn't shrunk linearly at 4.6% per annum, but the CAGR is a useful estimate of the historical rate of change.When a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Brookline Bancorp has grown its earnings per share at 16% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a good rate, and the company is paying less than half its earnings as dividends. We generally think this is an attractive combination, as it permits further reinvestment in the business.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Firstly, we like that Brookline Bancorp has a low and conservative payout ratio. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, but it was concerning to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Overall we think Brookline Bancorp is an interesting dividend stock, although it could be better.Story continuesCompanies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
