View our latest analysis for Tyman What is Tyman worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 14% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Tyman today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth £3.10, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future.
