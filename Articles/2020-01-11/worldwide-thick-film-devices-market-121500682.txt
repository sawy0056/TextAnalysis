The rising demand for solar cells and flexible devices, such as sensors are expected to propel the thick film devices market growth. For instance, in March 2018, Saudi Arabia and Japanese SoftBank signed an MoU to build the world's largest photovoltaic (PV), USD 200 billion, solar project by 2030. The drive for harnessing solar energy and cut the carbon emission augmented with declining solar panel price per unit area is expected to be among driving factor for demand.Competitive LandscapeThe thick film devices market is dominated by top players, with new players finding it difficult to enter the market due to the strong dominance of existing players. Some of the key players include General Electric Company, Panasonic Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, Sharp Corporation, Vishay Intertechnology Inc., TE Connectivity Ltd, KOA Speer Electronics, Inc., AVX Corporation, among others.January 2019 - AVX Corporation, a leading manufacturer and supplier of advanced electronic components and interconnect, sensor, control, and antenna solutions, introduced a new line of ultraminiature, thin-film transmission line capacitors for high-frequency links, DC blocking in the UHF range (300MHz - 3GHz), and other high-performance microwave and RF applications. The new capacitors have a novel metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure, copper traces for optimal circuit conductivity, a transmission line wire-bond pad, and a gold-metalized backside ground, and can be supplied on a variety of low-loss substrates, including quartz, alumina, glass, and silicon. The new transmission line capacitors are also available in a wide range of capacitance values: 0.3-50pF with a 20% tolerance, and each is made using a high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS) to proactively address any electromagnetic challenges and provide the highest possible RF performance and reliability.January 2018 - Ferro Techniek launched FTH XL, a flow-through heater based on thick film technology, which has a max capacity of 3400W at 230V. This is expected to attract a wide range of consumers and bring a high influx of revenue.Key Topics Covered: 1 INTRODUCTION2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY4 MARKET DYNAMICS4.1 Market Overview4.2 Market Drivers4.2.1 Growing Demand For Electronic And Electrical Components4.3 Market Restraints4.3.1 Stringent Government Regulations And High Investment Cost4.4 Industry Value Chain Analysis4.5 Industry Attractiveness - Porter's Five Force Analysis4.6 Technology Snapshot5 MARKET SEGMENTATION5.1 By Application5.2 By End-user Vertical5.3 Geography6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE7 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS8 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDSCompanies Mentioned General Electric Company Panasonic Corporation Samsung Electronics Co.
