With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO).Our data shows Tesco has a return on equity of 9.4% for the last year. That means that for every £1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated £0.09 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for Tesco How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Tesco:9.4% = UK£1.3b ÷ UK£14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. The easiest way to calculate shareholders' equity is to subtract the company's total liabilities from the total assets.What Does Return On Equity Signify?ROE looks at the amount a company earns relative to the money it has kept within the business. The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does Tesco Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Tesco has a superior ROE than the average (7.2%) company in the Consumer Retailing industry.LSE:TSCO Past Revenue and Net Income, January 10th 2020MoreThat's what I like to see. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. One data point to check is if insiders have bought shares recently.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Combining Tesco's Debt And Its 9.4% Return On EquityWhile Tesco does have some debt, with debt to equity of just 0.50, we wouldn't say debt is excessive. Its very respectable ROE, combined with only modest debt, suggests the business is in good shape. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.In SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.
