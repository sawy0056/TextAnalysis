There’s any number of ways to swap a SIM; in some cases, hackers even bribe or exploit cell carrier employees.Once the number is taken over, the fraudster can reset victims’ passwords, steal credentials and wipe personal information, bypassing most security mechanisms that rely on cellular two-factor authentication. That can be costly, especially for a crypto community still largely reliant on text-based account security. To date, millions of dollars in crypto have been stolen in alleged SIM swap attacks.The lawmakers’ chief concern appears to be America’s lack of comprehensive consumer protection policies. They note that some jurisdictions require prevention methods, like in-store verification, while others lag behind. “Implementation of these additional security measures by wireless carriers in the U.S. is still spotty and consumers are unlikely to find out about the availability of these obscure, optional security features until it is too late,” the lawmakers wrote. Related: European Crypto Firms Brace for Higher Costs as AMLD5 Takes EffectThey also demanded to know more about how the FCC tracks SIM swap reports, if it has been educating the public on prevention and if it has investigated such hacks in the past.One of the most public victims of an attack was crypto investor and communications executive Michael Terpin, who lost over $20 million to SIM-swappers in 2018. He sued his cell provider, AT&T, for failing to protect him, alleging the company was responsible for its employees who allegedly worked with the fraudsters. That suit is ongoing. Terpin also wrote FCC’s Pai, in October, urging action against SIM swapping. Last month, prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Nicholas Truglia, who is suspected of orchestrating the Terpin heist.Related StoriesESMA Wants to Create ‘Sound Legal Framework’ for Cryptocurrencies in 2020New York Governor Proposes Giving Financial Watchdog More TeethReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFCC Probe Finds Mobile Carriers Didn’t Safeguard Customer Location DataThe Wall Street JournalMeet HHS Secretary Alex Azar, the Official Chairing the Coronavirus Task ForceTimeFCC may fine carriers for failing to protect phone location dataEngadgetMichelle Obama petitioned to run as vice-president to stop Bernie Sanders, report saysThe IndependentBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
