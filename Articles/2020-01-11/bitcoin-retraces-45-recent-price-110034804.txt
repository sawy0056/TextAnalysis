However, the pullback was based on low volumes and could be reversed. A move above $8,000 would imply an end of the price pullback and open the doors for a re-test of the recent high of $8,463.Bitcoin is flashing red for the third straight day, with a major portion of the recent price gains now erased.After a drop back to below $7,800, the cryptocurrency has erased nearly 45 percent of the rise from $6,850 to $8,463 witnessed in the six days to Jan. 8, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.At press time, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value is currently changing hands near $7,757, representing a 1.5 percent drop from the day’s opening price (UTC) of $7,875. Bitcoin shed 1.4 percent and 2.9 percent on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.Related: Bitcoin’s Bull Bias Intact Despite 6 Percent Price PullbackThe cryptocurrency did show signs of life with a move higher from $7,780 to $8,000 during the early U.S. trading hours on Thursday. However, the bulls lost momentum near the $8,000 psychological resistance and the minor bounce was quickly reversed.The rejection likely invited stronger selling pressure, yielding a drop to a low of $7,676 earlier today.Lookingforward, a deeper drop to key support below $7,600 cannot be ruled out.Hourly chartBitcoin has dived out of an ascending trendline on the hourly chart, violating the bullish higher -lows pattern.Related: Bitcoin Price Will Be Golden in 2020 Thanks to Limited Supply, Increasing Use: Bloomberg ReportFurther, it has found acceptance under the widely-tracked 100-hour average, with the relative strength index (RSI) reporting bearish conditions below 50.Daily chartBitcoin created a spinning top candle on Wednesday, signaling indecision in the market place.That ended with bears coming out victorious, as indicated by Thursday’s 2.9 percent drop.Put simply, the odds of a slide to $7,555 – a former hurdle-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline – have increased over the last 24 hours.The breakout, however, would be invalidated only if BTC prints a UTC close above $7,555.Low-volume pullbackAs seen on the four-hour chart, selling volumes, as represented by the red bars, have dropped throughout the pullback from $8,463 to $7,700.Alow-volume pullback is often short-lived. Hence, the bears need to observecaution despite signs of weakness in the hourly and daily charts.A move above $8,000, a level that acted as a strong hurdle on Thursday, will imply an end of the pullback and will likely yield a re-test of recent highs above $8,400.Disclosure: The author does not currently hold any digital assets.Related StoriesBitcoin May Follow Gold With Significant Price BreakoutBitcoin Hits New 2020 High Above $8,400 After Iranian Missile AttackReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCryptocurrency News: SEC Shuts Down Another Bitcoin ETFInvestopediaEther Futures Volume on FTX Hit Record HighsCoindeskSteven Seagal Isn’t Above the Securities LawThe Wall Street JournalIran commander touts crypto as solution to bypass sanctionsCoin RivetSteven Seagal fined in US over cryptocurrency promotionAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
