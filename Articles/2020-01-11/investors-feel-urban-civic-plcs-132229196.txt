This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. After that, we will consider the growth in the business. And finally we will reflect on how common stockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. See our latest analysis for Urban&Civic How Does Nigel Hugill's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?According to our data, Urban&Civic plc has a market capitalization of UK£509m, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth UK£1.7m over the year to September 2019. Notably, that's an increase of 43% over the year before. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at UK£421k. Importantly, there may be performance hurdles relating to the non-salary component of the total compensation. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations from UK£306m to UK£1.2b, and the median CEO total compensation was UK£888k.As you can see, Nigel Hugill is paid more than the median CEO pay at companies of a similar size, in the same market.

A closer look at the performance of the underlying business will give us a better idea about whether the pay is particularly generous.You can see a visual representation of the CEO compensation at Urban&Civic, below.LSE:UANC CEO Compensation, January 10th 2020MoreIs Urban&Civic plc Growing?Urban&Civic plc has reduced its earnings per share by an average of 9.0% a year, over the last three years (measured with a line of best fit).
