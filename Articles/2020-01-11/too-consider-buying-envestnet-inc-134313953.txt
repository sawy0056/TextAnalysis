(NYSE:ENV)?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosEnvestnet, Inc. (NYSE:ENV), which is in the software business, and is based in United States, saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Envestnet’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Envestnet Is Envestnet still cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 5.36% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Envestnet today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $69.89, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Envestnet’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Envestnet look like?NYSE:ENV Past and Future Earnings, January 10th 2020MoreFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.
