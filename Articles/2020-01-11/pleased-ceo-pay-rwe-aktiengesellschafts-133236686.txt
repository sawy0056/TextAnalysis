First, this article will compare CEO compensation with compensation at other large companies. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally we will reflect on how common stockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of performance. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels. See our latest analysis for RWE How Does Rolf Schmitz's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?Our data indicates that RWE Aktiengesellschaft is worth €16b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as €4.1m for the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at €1.2m. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. When we examined a group of companies with market caps over €7.2b, we found that their median CEO total compensation was €4.0m. (We took a wide range because the CEOs of massive companies tend to be paid similar amounts - even though some are quite a bit bigger than others).So Rolf Schmitz receives a similar amount to the median CEO pay, amongst the companies we looked at.
