But will that repair the damage for the weary investors who have owned this stock as it declined over half a decade? Probably not. Five years have seen the share price descend precipitously, down a full 98%. It's true that the recent bounce could signal the company is turning over a new leaf, but we are not so sure. The fundamental business performance will ultimately determine if the turnaround can be sustained.We really feel for shareholders in this scenario. It's a good reminder of the importance of diversification, and it's worth keeping in mind there's more to life than money, anyway. See our latest analysis for Indoor Skydive Australia Group Indoor Skydive Australia Group wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.Over five years, Indoor Skydive Australia Group grew its revenue at 22% per year. That's better than most loss-making companies. So it's not at all clear to us why the share price sunk 54% throughout that time. You'd have to assume the market is worried that profits won't come soon enough. We'd recommend carefully checking for indications of future growth - and balance sheet threats - before considering a purchase.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).ASX:IDZ Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 53% over the last half decade.
