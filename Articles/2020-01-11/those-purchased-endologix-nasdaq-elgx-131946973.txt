We really hate to see fellow investors lose their hard-earned money. For example, we sympathize with anyone who was caught holding Endologix, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELGX) during the five years that saw its share price drop a whopping 99%. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 70% in the last year. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 49% in the last three months.While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness. Check out our latest analysis for Endologix Endologix wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.In the last half decade, Endologix saw its revenue increase by 0.8% per year. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. It's not so sure that share price crash of 58% per year is completely deserved, but the market is doubtless disappointed. While we're definitely wary of the stock, after that kind of performance, it could be an over-reaction. A company like this generally needs to produce profits before it can find favour with new investors.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NasdaqGS:ELGX Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. You can see what analysts are predicting for Endologix in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 27% in the last year, Endologix shareholders lost 70%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 58% over the last half decade. We realise that Buffett has said investors should 'buy when there is blood on the streets', but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality businesses.
