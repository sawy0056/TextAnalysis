MultiClient revenues are expected to be $177 million and contract revenues $104 million.“It is five years since we had higher quarterly revenues than what we achieved in Q4 2019. Revenues benefitted from an improving seismic market, but were negatively impacted by challenging and delayed mobilization for several of our large projects offshore Africa,” says President & CEO Rune Olav Pedersen.PGS routinely releases information about 3D vessel utilization after the end of each quarter.Summary of vessel utilization:   Approximate allocation of PGS operated 3D towed streamer capacity

All cold-stacked** vessels are excluded from the statistics.The Company provides this information based on a preliminary summary of Q4 2019 numbers. The Company has not completed its financial reporting and related consolidation, review and control procedures, including the final review of all sales against the established revenue recognition/cut-off criteria. The estimates provided in this release are therefore subject to change and the Q4 2019 financial statements finally approved and released by the Company may deviate from the information herein.PGS will release its Q4 2019 results on Thursday January 30, 2020, at approximately 7:00am Central European Time (CET). A corresponding presentation is scheduled for 09:00am CET the same day.*For the purpose of Segment reporting, MultiClient prefunding revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis, and the related amortization of MultiClient library is based upon the ratio of aggregate capitalized survey costs to forecasted sales. This differs from IFRS reporting which recognizes revenue from MultiClient prefunding agreements and related amortization at the “point in time” when the customer receives access to, or delivery of, the finished data. For further description of the principles applied, see details in the 2018 annual report.**The term "cold-stacked" is used when a vessel is taken out of operation for an extended period of time. Costs are reduced to a minimum, with the vessel preserved for a long idle time, all or most in-sea seismic equipment removed from the vessel, and typically the Company does not have available crew to operate the vessel.                                          FOR DETAILS, CONTACT:
