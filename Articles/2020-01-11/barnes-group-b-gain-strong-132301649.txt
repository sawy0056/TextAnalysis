B.Over the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has returned 18.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 9.6%. Existing ScenarioBarnes Group has been benefiting from robust original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sales and solid aerospace aftermarket business on account of higher demand for MRO and spare parts. Supported by a healthy backlog level at the OEM business, management expects its sales to grow in high single digits to low double digits for 2019. In addition, in the company’s aftermarket business, it expects MRO sales to grow in low double-digits range compared with mid to high single-digits rise predicted earlier.The company has been strengthening business through addition of assets. For instance, its acquisition of Industrial Gas Springs Group (“IGS”) in July 2018 and Gimatics in October 2018 are worth mentioning. Notably, IGS and Gimatics together contributed $13.6 million or 6% to Industrial segment’s revenues in third-quarter 2019. The company expects acquisitions to boost total revenues by approximately 4% in 2019.However, weakness in the company’s Industrial segment remains a concern. Notably, softness in the automotive end market on account of slowing global economies and trade uncertainties are hurting the segment.In addition, the company is currently dealing with rising cost of sales. For instance, in the last five years (2014-2018), its cost of sales increased 3% year over year (CAGR). The metric recorded an increase of 0.8% in the first nine months of 2019, on a year-over-year basis.
