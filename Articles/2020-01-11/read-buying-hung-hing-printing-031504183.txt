Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis SEHK:450 Historical Dividend Yield, January 10th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Although Hung Hing Printing Group pays a dividend, it was loss-making during the past year. When a company is loss-making, we next need to check to see if its cash flows can support the dividend.Unfortunately, while Hung Hing Printing Group pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.With a strong net cash balance, Hung Hing Printing Group investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.We update our data on Hung Hing Printing Group every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Hung Hing Printing Group's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was HK$0.14 in 2010, compared to HK$0.10 last year. This works out to be a decline of approximately 3.3% per year over that time. Hung Hing Printing Group's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 3.3% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.We struggle to make a case for buying Hung Hing Printing Group for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past ten years.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. It's good to see Hung Hing Printing Group has been growing its earnings per share at 41% a year over the past five years.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Hung Hing Printing Group's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Hung Hing Printing Group's dividend is not well covered by free cash flow, plus it paid a dividend while being unprofitable. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, but it was concerning to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Overall, Hung Hing Printing Group falls short in several key areas here. Unless the investor has strong grounds for an alternative conclusion, we find it hard to get interested in a dividend stock with these characteristics.Story continuesSee if management have their own wealth at stake, by checking insider shareholdings in Hung Hing Printing Group stock.If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of dividend stocks yielding above 3%.If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
