Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group)! SEHK:560 Historical Dividend Yield, January 10th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group) paid out 56% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.We also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. The company paid out 63% of its free cash flow, which is not bad per se, but does start to limit the amount of cash Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group) has available to meet other needs. It's positive to see that Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group)'s dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group)'s strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.We update our data on Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group) every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group)'s dividend payments. Its dividend payments have declined on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was HK$0.05 in 2010, compared to HK$0.09 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 6.1% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.Story continuesDividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. It's not great to see that Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group)'s have fallen at approximately 5.4% over the past five years. Declining earnings per share over a number of years is not a great sign for the dividend investor. Without some improvement, this does not bode well for the long term value of a company's dividend.ConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group)'s is paying out more than half its income as dividends, but at least the dividend is covered by both reported earnings and cashflow. Earnings per share have been falling, and the company has cut its dividend at least once in the past. From a dividend perspective, this is a cause for concern. In summary, Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (Group) has a number of shortcomings that we'd find it hard to get past. Things could change, but we think there are likely more attractive alternatives out there.Are management backing themselves to deliver performance?
