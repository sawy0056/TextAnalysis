(VTX:NWRN) Expected To BreakevenSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosNewron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A.'s (VTX:NWRN): Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A., a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the research and development, manufacture, and distribution of therapies for the treatment of central and peripheral nervous system in Italy and internationally. The company’s loss has recently broadened since it announced a -€15.0m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of -€21.5m, moving it further away from breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is NWRN’s path to profitability – when will it breakeven? Below I will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for NWRN. Check out our latest analysis for Newron Pharmaceuticals Consensus from the 2 Pharmaceuticals analysts is NWRN is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2020, before turning a profit of €73m in 2021. NWRN is therefore projected to breakeven around a couple of months from now! What rate will NWRN have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, I calculated an average annual growth rate of 67%, which is extremely buoyant. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.SWX:NWRN Past and Future Earnings, January 10th 2020MoreGiven this is a high-level overview, I won’t go into details of NWRN’s upcoming projects, but, bear in mind that typically a pharma company has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the drug and stage of product development the business is in. This means, large upcoming growth rates are not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments.Before I wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. NWRN has managed its capital judiciously, with debt making up 22% of equity. This means that NWRN has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital,and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Next Steps:There are key fundamentals of NWRN which are not covered in this article, but I must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.
