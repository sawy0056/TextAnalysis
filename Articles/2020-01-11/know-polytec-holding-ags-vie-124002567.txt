While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.Polytec Holding's earnings per share fell by 28% in the last twelve months. But it has grown its earnings per share by 8.1% per year over the last five years. And over the longer term (3 years) earnings per share have decreased 9.0% annually. This growth rate might warrant a low P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Polytec Holding's Balance SheetPolytec Holding's net debt is 87% of its market cap. This is a reasonably significant level of debt -- all else being equal you'd expect a much lower P/E than if it had net cash.The Verdict On Polytec Holding's P/E RatioPolytec Holding trades on a P/E ratio of 8.8, which is below the AT market average of 14.7. The P/E reflects market pessimism that probably arises from the lack of recent EPS growth, paired with significant leverage.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
