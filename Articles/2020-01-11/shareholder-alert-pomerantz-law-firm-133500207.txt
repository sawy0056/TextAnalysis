The Company's primary development programs are based on oral delivery solutions for poorly bioavailable drugs. The Company has a portfolio of product candidates purportedly designed to produce pharmacokinetic characteristics and facilitate lower dosing requirements, bypass first-pass metabolism in certain cases, reduce side effects, and eliminate gastrointestinal interactions that limit bioavailability.Lipocine's lead product candidate is TLANDO (LPCN 1021), an oral testosterone replacement therapy. The Company has previously submitted New Drug Applications ("NDA") for TLANDO twice and, both times, received Complete Response Letters ("CRL") from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") rejecting the NDAs. The Company received the first CRL in June 2016 and the second in May 2018.On March 27, 2019, during pre-market hours, Lipocine issued a press release announcing new topline results from a study evaluating TLANDO's effects on blood pressure (one issue cited by the FDA in a prior CRL rejecting TLANDO's NDA), as well as the Company's intention to refile the NDA for TLANDO in the second quarter of 2019 (the "March 2019 Press Release").The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the results from Lipocine's clinical studies of TLANDO were insufficient to demonstrate the drug's efficacy; (ii) accordingly, Lipocine's third NDA for TLANDO was highly likely to be found deficient by the FDA; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.On November 11, 2019, Lipocine issued a press release announcing receipt of a CRL from the FDA regarding its NDA for TLANDO. In the press release, Lipocine advised investors that the FDA had again rejected the NDA for TLANDO-this time because an efficacy trial had not met three of its secondary endpoints.On this news, Lipocine's stock price fell $1.93 per share, or 70.7%, to close at $0.80 per share on November 11, 2019.The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
