Competition is fierce, profit margins are low and consumers’ tastes and preferences change with time. Plus, time and again established brands somehow have been able to yield big gains for investors over the long run. But small-scale businesses mostly struggle and many don’t manage to survive.Thanks to GrubHub and Uber Eats, delivery services are currently on the rise. Such digital food ordering methods mean less foot traffic in many restaurant chains, eventually hurting bottom lines. Industry researcher TDn2K did confirm that there has been an all-out decline in average foot traffic for years, dealing a blow to comparable store sales.But despite such disappointing developments, it is the right time to pick some solid restaurant stocks. This is because such companies not only on an individual capacity have made the necessary changes to suit customers’ desires, consumer spending on eating out has also been rising steadily for quite some time now. Particularly last year, money spent on eating out equaled that spent at grocery stores for the first time in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.And let’s admit that the domestic economy is humming and consumers are pretty confident about their well-being, which usually leads to folks eating out more often. The pace of U.S. economic expansion picked up in the third quarter of 2019. Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.1% in the three months ended Sep 30, 2019, versus the initial estimate of 1.9% and 2% in the second quarter.Separately, the U.S. Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence continues to remain high, as it came in at 126.5 for December. In fact, November’s reading was raised from 125.5 to 126.8. Moreover, the index that shows how consumers feel about the economy right now rose 4.4 points to 170. But what made Americans feel so confident? It’s a strong labor market and the lowest level of unemployment in a half-century.4 Top-Notch Restaurant Stocks to Buy NowIt will, therefore, be prudent to watch out for fundamentally-sound restaurant stocks that can make the most of the bullish scenario.
