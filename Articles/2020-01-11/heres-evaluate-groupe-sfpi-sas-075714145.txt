How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.With a 2.9% yield and a four-year payment history, investors probably think GROUPE SFPI looks like a reliable dividend stock. While the yield may not look too great, the relatively long payment history is interesting. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 11% of market capitalisation this year. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ENXTPA:SFPI Historical Dividend Yield, January 10th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, GROUPE SFPI paid out 55% of its profit as dividends. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.In addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. GROUPE SFPI's cash payout ratio in the last year was 43%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's positive to see that GROUPE SFPI's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.While the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note GROUPE SFPI's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of GROUPE SFPI's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. GROUPE SFPI has been paying a dividend for the past four years. It has only been paying dividends for a few short years, and the dividend has already been cut at least once. This is one income stream we're not ready to live on. During the past four-year period, the first annual payment was €1.20 in 2016, compared to €0.05 last year. The dividend has fallen 96% over that period.We struggle to make a case for buying GROUPE SFPI for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past four years.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. GROUPE SFPI's earnings per share have shrunk at 57% a year over the past five years. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and GROUPE SFPI's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.Story continuesConclusionWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. First, we think GROUPE SFPI has an acceptable payout ratio and its dividend is well covered by cashflow. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and its dividend has been cut at least once in the past. Ultimately, GROUPE SFPI comes up short on our dividend analysis. It's not that we think it is a bad company - just that there are likely more appealing dividend prospects out there on this analysis.Are management backing themselves to deliver performance?
