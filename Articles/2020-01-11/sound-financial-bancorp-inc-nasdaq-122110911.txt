(NASDAQ:SFBC) At This P/E Ratio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosSound Financial Bancorp (NASDAQ:SFBC) shares have retraced a considerable in the last month, but the stock is still up slightly on where it started the quarter. Looking back over the last year, the stock has been a solid performer, with a gain of 10%.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. See our latest analysis for Sound Financial Bancorp Does Sound Financial Bancorp Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 14.45 that there is some investor optimism about Sound Financial Bancorp. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (12.9) for companies in the banks industry is lower than Sound Financial Bancorp's P/E.NasdaqCM:SFBC Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects Sound Financial Bancorp will outperform other companies in its industry. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosEarnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. Earnings growth means that in the future the 'E' will be higher. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Sound Financial Bancorp saw earnings per share decrease by 2.9% last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 7.8%.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Sound Financial Bancorp's Balance SheetWith net cash of US$46m, Sound Financial Bancorp has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 50% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On Sound Financial Bancorp's P/E RatioSound Financial Bancorp's P/E is 14.5 which is below average (18.9) in the US market. Falling earnings per share are likely to be keeping potential buyers away, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: if so, the low P/E could be an opportunity. What can be absolutely certain is that the market has become less optimistic about Sound Financial Bancorp over the last month, with the P/E ratio falling from 14.5 back then to 14.5 today. For those who don't like to trade against momentum, that could be a warning sign, but a contrarian investor might want to take a closer look.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
