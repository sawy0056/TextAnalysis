The Nasdaq climbed 1.8% in its fifth consecutive week of gains.The gains followed easing tensions between the United States and Iran and firmer hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal. The S&P 500 technology index <.SPLRCT>, which gained 2.2% for the week, was down 0.2% on Friday.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business the trade deal is on track to be signed on Jan. 15.Boeing Co <BA.N> fell 1.9% after the company released hundreds of internal messages that contained harshly critical comments on 737 MAX development.With the fourth-quarter earnings season set to begin in earnest next week, analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies to have declined 0.6% in their second consecutive quarterly decline, according to Refinitiv IBES data.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 61 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 106 new highs and 27 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.77 billion shares, compared with the 7 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch in New York; Additional reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Matthew Lewis)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHere are 5 reasons the stock market is having its worst decline since 2008, and only one of them is the coronavirusMarketWatchHow bad is the coronavirus-sparked stock-market selloff? — the Dow’s weekly skid would rank within the top 15 worst in its 124-year historyMarketWatchU.S. Stock Market Suffers Brutally as Dow Drops to Historic Low Amid Coronavirus FearsPeopleThese stocks have been crushed since the coronavirus began to take down the U.S. marketMarketWatchStock Market Collapses Nearly 1,200 Points as Coronavirus Fears EscalateFootwear NewsBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
