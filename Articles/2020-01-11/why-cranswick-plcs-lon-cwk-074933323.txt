We'll show how you can use Cranswick plc's (LON:CWK) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, Cranswick has a P/E ratio of 23.21. That means that at current prices, buyers pay £23.21 for every £1 in trailing yearly profits. View our latest analysis for Cranswick How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Cranswick:P/E of 23.21 = £33.00 ÷ £1.42 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.Does Cranswick Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (16.6) for companies in the food industry is lower than Cranswick's P/E.LSE:CWK Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Cranswick shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Cranswick's earnings per share grew by -6.2% in the last twelve months. And earnings per share have improved by 11% annually, over the last five years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.So What Does Cranswick's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Cranswick has net debt worth just 3.7% of its market capitalization. The market might award it a higher P/E ratio if it had net cash, but its unlikely this low level of net borrowing is having a big impact on the P/E multiple.The Bottom Line On Cranswick's P/E RatioCranswick trades on a P/E ratio of 23.2, which is above its market average of 18.4. With modest debt relative to its size, and modest earnings growth, the market is likely expecting sustained long-term growth, if not a near-term improvement.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.
