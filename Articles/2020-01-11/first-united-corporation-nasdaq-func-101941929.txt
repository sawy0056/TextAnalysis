If you purchase the stock on or after the 14th of January, you won't be eligible to receive this dividend, when it is paid on the 3rd of February.First United's next dividend payment will be US$0.13 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.52 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, First United stock has a trailing yield of around 2.2% on the current share price of $23.82. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for First United Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. First United is paying out just 22% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see how much of its profit First United paid out over the last 12 months.NasdaqGS:FUNC Historical Dividend Yield, January 10th 2020MoreHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see First United's earnings per share have risen 19% per annum over the last five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. First United has seen its dividend decline 4.2% per annum on average over the past ten years, which is not great to see. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy.The Bottom LineIs First United worth buying for its dividend? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. First United ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.Want to learn more about First United?
