That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does Plásticos Compuestos Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Plásticos Compuestos has a lower P/E than the average (17.3) in the chemicals industry classification.BME:KOM Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MorePlásticos Compuestos's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry.

For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.Plásticos Compuestos's 325% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Plásticos Compuestos's Balance SheetNet debt is 43% of Plásticos Compuestos's market cap. While that's enough to warrant consideration, it doesn't really concern us.The Verdict On Plásticos Compuestos's P/E RatioPlásticos Compuestos trades on a P/E ratio of 1.3, which is below the ES market average of 16.9. The EPS growth last year was strong, and debt levels are quite reasonable. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.
