This is especially worrying in light of recent announcements by financial institutions, including banks and pension funds, to limit their allocations to certain or even all fossil fuel investments.Consequently, energy companies have moved from living on a wing and a prayer, hoping for another oil boom to get them out of the rut to a more proactive philosophy where capital and cost discipline have become the new mantra.Related: The U.S. Aims For Energy Storage DominanceDebt levels in the energy sector peaked in 2017 but have gradually been coming down. Debt and leverage ratios have steadily improved since then, driven by improved cash flows and increased capital discipline. Many companies turned to debt financing mainly as a stop-gap to keep production flowing in the hope that prices would rebound quickly.Obviously, this has not happened, with the WSJ reporting that North American energy companies now have $200 billion of debt maturities over the next four years with $40 billion due in 2020.View photosSource: WSJThe bad part: It’s unclear how they will repay that mountain of debt, and many might have to stick to the usual playbook of selling shares in the secondary markets. Investors hate share dilution, and this could trigger another wave of selling.Meanwhile, although organic capex in 2019 increased compared with 2018, it’s still a fraction of the levels recorded in 2013/2014.Strategy #2: Projects that Deliver FasterAs part of capital and cost discipline, oil and gas companies are rapidly shifting to shorter-cycle projects with faster payback periods. In many cases, they are prioritizing investments with a lower carbon footprint, especially gas. According to IHS Markit Research, investments in low-carbon sectors by seven leading integrated oil & gas companies have exceeded $8 billion over the past decade.The strategy seems to be paying off: According to the IEA, energy companies are bringing capacity to the market 20% faster compared to a decade ago. The changing energy system is helping the industry better manage capital at risk.Story continuesView photosSource: EIAStrategy #3: Investing in RenewablesNowadays, many people dismiss even genuine attempts by the energy sector to adopt the language of climate action and sustainable production as a disgraceful and desperate attempt at greenwash. But truth be told, scores of fossil fuel companies really are at the forefront of the clean energy drive.Related: U.S. Drillers Rush To Hedge Production As Oil Prices SoarEvolving new technologies, shareholder pressure, and rapidly changing consumer preferences are forcing oil and gas companies to explore new business streams, renewables being chief among them. The last four years have seen a surge in renewables investments by oil and gas companies. In the first three quarters of 2019, oil companies closed about 70 deals in various renewable energy sectors including solar, wind and biofuels with Royal Dutch Shell Plc cutting the most valuable deals.View photosSource: BloombergInterestingly, European companies lead their American counterparts by a wide margin, investing 7x as much in the renewable sector last year. Seven companies have accounted for about three-quarters of renewable energy deals since 2010, with all but Chevron Corp. and Saudi Arabian Oil Co. being based in Europe.View photosSource: BloombergThe question now is whether oil companies have missed the boat on changing their ethos to combat the crisis of perception among investors.With $40-billion in debt coming due already this year, our answer to that question may come sooner than we think. The adaptation strategies are working, but they’re going to have to work faster. That’s also what’s likely to make 2020 a year of consolidation more than any other. Those who’ve managed to successfully tweak their ethos can likely scoop up those who haven’t for a nice discount. By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Hottest Permian Takeover Targets For 2020Russia And Turkey Call For Ceasefire In War-Torn LibyaOil Giant Sees Stock Soar 20% On Unexpected Oil FindRead this article on OilPrice.comReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCultural preservation among options in oil and gas planAssociated PressOil prices fall again, on track for biggest weekly drop in over 4 yearsReutersEOG Resources (EOG) Q4 Earnings Top EstimatesZacksChinese scientist sentenced to prison in US for technology theftAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
