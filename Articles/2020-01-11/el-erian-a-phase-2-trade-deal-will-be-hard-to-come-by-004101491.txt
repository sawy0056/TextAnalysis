REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstMoreAfter indicating that negotiations for a phase two deal would follow shortly after signing the phase one deal, President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday at the White House that he may wait to negotiate a phase two trade deal until after the 2020 presidential election.“We’ll start negotiating right away Phase Two. It’ll take a little time,” Trump said. “I think I might want to wait to finish it till after the election because by doing that I think we can actually make a little bit better deal, maybe a lot better deal.”Phase one is more of a truce and a ceasefire and doesn’t really address the complex issues, according to El-Erian. And “phase two is a lot more complicated than phase one.”—Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
