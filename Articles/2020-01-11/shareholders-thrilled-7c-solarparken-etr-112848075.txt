The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, 7C Solarparken's TSR for the last 5 years was 142%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that 7C Solarparken shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 41% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 19% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
