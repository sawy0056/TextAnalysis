Is U and I Group PLC (LON:UAI) A Good Fit?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we'll take a closer look at U and I Group PLC (LON:UAI) from a dividend investor's perspective. Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.In this case, U and I Group likely looks attractive to investors, given its 5.7% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on U and I Group! LSE:UAI Historical Dividend Yield, January 10th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, U and I Group paid out 141% of its profit as dividends. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of U and I Group's latest financial position,
by checking our visualisation of its financial health.Dividend VolatilityFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. U and I Group has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having been cut one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was UK£0.048 in 2010, compared to UK£0.10 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.6% a year over that time. U and I Group's dividend payments have fluctuated, so it hasn't grown 7.6% every year, but the CAGR is a useful rule of thumb for approximating the historical growth.A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.Dividend Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. U and I Group's EPS have fallen by approximately 24% per year during the past five years. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and U and I Group's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.ConclusionDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. We're a bit uncomfortable with its high payout ratio. Earnings per share are down, and U and I Group's dividend has been cut at least once in the past, which is disappointing. Using these criteria, U and I Group looks suboptimal from a dividend investment perspective.Story continuesAre management backing themselves to deliver performance?
