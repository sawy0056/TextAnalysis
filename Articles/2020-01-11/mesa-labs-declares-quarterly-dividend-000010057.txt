Generally, the words "believe," “estimate,” “intend,” "expect," "project," “anticipate,” "will" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to revenues growth and statements expressing general views about future operating results — are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019, and those described from time to time in our subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.For more information about the Company, please visit its website at www.mesalabs.comCONTACT: Gary Owens.; President and CEO, or John Sakys; CFO, both of Mesa Laboratories, Inc., +1-303-987-8000ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextChris Froome among riders to be tested for coronavirus as UAE Tour cancelledPA Media: SportMPA Says It’s “Closely Monitoring” Global Spread Of Coronavirus; SAG-AFTRA Issues Statement – UpdateDeadlineFacebook Cancels F8 Developers Conference Amid Coronavirus FearsDeadlineGet a Sneak Peek of the Buckingham Palace RenovationsThe Oprah MagazineTrump Taps Pence To Lead Coronavirus Response As CDC Warns Of Looming SpreadHuffPostBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
