Estimated net flows into open-end and exchange-traded sustainable funds that are available to U.S. investors totaled $20.6 billion for the year. That's nearly 4 times the previous annual record for net flows set in 2018.View photosThe flow data encompasses 300 mutual funds that thoroughly integrate environmental, social, and governance factors into their investment processes, and/or pursue sustainability-related investment themes, and/or seek measurable sustainable impact alongside financial returns.The sustainable funds group does not contain funds that employ only limited exclusionary screens without a broader emphasis on ESG, nor does it contain the growing number of funds that now acknowledge that they consider ESG factors in a limited way in their security selection.Flows picked up momentum over the course of 2019. During the fourth quarter, estimated net flows jumped to $7.1 billion, easily surpassing the record high for a quarter of $4.8 billion, set in 2019's second quarter.View photosWith growing investor interest in sustainable investing, especially among younger investors, 2019's flows may be the leading edge of a huge wave of assets to come.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Top-Performing Mutual Funds to Consider for Your Retirement Portfolio- February 24, 2020 (Revised)ZacksDoes Your Retirement Portfolio Hold These 3 Mutual Fund Misfires? - February 27, 2020ZacksAvoid These 3 Mutual Fund Misfires - February 27, 2020ZacksAre You Invested In These 3 Mutual Fund Misfires? - February 27, 2020ZacksMutual Fund Misfires of the Market - February 27, 2020ZacksBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
