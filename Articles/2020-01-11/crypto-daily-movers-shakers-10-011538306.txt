Ethereum (-2.08%) and Ripple’s XRP (-1.66%) led the way down.Binance Coin (-1.10%), EOS (-0.96%), Litecoin (-1.30%), and Monero’s XMR (-0.98%) also saw heavy losses on Thursday.Bitcoin Cash ABC (-0.25%) and Tron’s TRX (-0.66%) saw relatively modest losses on the day.Through the current week, the crypto total market cap jumped from $197bn levels to an early Wednesday current week high $220.27bn before easing back to sub-$210bn levels.
