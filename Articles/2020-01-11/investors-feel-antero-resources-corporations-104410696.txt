This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Next, we'll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally we will reflect on how common stockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. See our latest analysis for Antero Resources How Does Paul Rady's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?Our data indicates that Antero Resources Corporation is worth US$714m, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$8.4m for the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$858k. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We examined companies with market caps from US$400m to US$1.6b, and discovered that the median CEO total compensation of that group was US$2.5m.It would therefore appear that Antero Resources Corporation pays Paul Rady more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market.
