Background
On Oct. 13, some 2,000 workers, from five locations (three open pit copper mines and smelter in Arizona and a refinery in Amarillo, Texas), went on an unfair labor practice strike protesting series labor law violations by ASARCO and the company's inability to bargain in good faith. The workers are represented by seven international unions:United Steel Workers Teamsters International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) United Association (Plumbers, fitters, welders, and service techs) Operating Engineers BoilermakersNegotiations over a new contract have been stalled since November 2018, when the previous 14-month contract expired. In early October 2019, ASARCO revealed its "last and final offer," which included:An extension to the decade-long pay freeze for majority of workers (2/3) Doubling of healthcare contributions Freeze on pensionsThe offer was quickly rejected by the mine workers.On December 2, 2019 ASARCO illegally implemented the "last, best and final" to the workers at all the locations currently on strike.ASARCO is a subsidiary of corporate giant Grupo Mexico, the third-largest mining company in the United States, also owning mines in Mexico and South America as well as rail roads and other industries. ASARCO operates three open-pit copper mines and a smelter in Arizona and a refinery in Amarillo, Texas.Contact: Dawn Schumann, (602) 300-5650 dawn.schumann@teamsterslocal104.comCisionMoreView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/grijalva-gomez-durazo-and-la-fed-join-striking-asarco-workers-on-picket-line-300984726.htmlSOURCE Teamsters Local Union 104ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhistleblower: Feds helping evacuees lacked virus protectionAssociated PressRestauranteur Harry Morton's Official Cause of Death Revealed by Los Angeles Coroner's OfficePeopleBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
