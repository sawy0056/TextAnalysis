We'll show how you can use Giordano International Limited's (HKG:709) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Giordano International has a price to earnings ratio of 9.75, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 10.3%. Check out our latest analysis for Giordano International How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Giordano International:P/E of 9.75 = HK$2.39 ÷ HK$0.25 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each HK$1 the company has earned over the last year. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does Giordano International Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see Giordano International has a lower P/E than the average (10.9) in the specialty retail industry classification.SEHK:709 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreGiordano International's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with Giordano International, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.Giordano International's earnings per share fell by 24% in the last twelve months. And over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have decreased 5.0% annually. This could justify a pessimistic P/E.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Giordano International's Balance SheetGiordano International has net cash of HK$1.0b. This is fairly high at 27% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Bottom Line On Giordano International's P/E RatioGiordano International trades on a P/E ratio of 9.7, which is below the HK market average of 10.6. The recent drop in earnings per share would almost certainly temper expectations, the relatively strong balance sheet will allow the company time to invest in growth. If it achieves that, then there's real potential that the low P/E could eventually indicate undervaluation.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
