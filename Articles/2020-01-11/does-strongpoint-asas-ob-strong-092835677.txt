We'll show how you can use StrongPoint ASA's (OB:STRONG) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. Based on the last twelve months, StrongPoint's P/E ratio is 24.41. That means that at current prices, buyers pay NOK24.41 for every NOK1 in trailing yearly profits. See our latest analysis for StrongPoint How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for StrongPoint:P/E of 24.41 = NOK11.60 ÷ NOK0.48 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does StrongPoint Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (20.3) for companies in the electronic industry is lower than StrongPoint's P/E.OB:STRONG Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that StrongPoint shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.StrongPoint's earnings per share fell by 12% in the last twelve months. But it has grown its earnings per share by 8.5% per year over the last five years. And over the longer term (3 years) earnings per share have decreased 26% annually. This might lead to low expectations.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).So What Does StrongPoint's Balance Sheet Tell Us?StrongPoint's net debt is 11% of its market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.The Bottom Line On StrongPoint's P/E RatioStrongPoint trades on a P/E ratio of 24.4, which is above its market average of 14.0. With a bit of debt, but a lack of recent growth, it's safe to say the market is expecting improved profit performance from the company, in the next few years.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. People often underestimate remarkable growth -- so investors can make money when fast growth is not fully appreciated. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.
