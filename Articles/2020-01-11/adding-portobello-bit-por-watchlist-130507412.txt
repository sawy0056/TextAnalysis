But as Warren Buffett has mused, 'If you've been playing poker for half an hour and you still don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy.' When they buy such story stocks, investors are all too often the patsy.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like Portobello (BIT:POR). Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, unless its owners have an endless appetite for subsidizing the customer, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else breathe its last breath. Check out our latest analysis for Portobello How Fast Is Portobello Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Even modest earnings per share growth (EPS) can create meaningful value, when it is sustained reliably from year to year. So EPS growth can certainly encourage an investor to take note of a stock. Like a firecracker arcing through the night sky, Portobello's EPS shot from €0.33 to €0.88, over the last year. You don't see 166% year-on-year growth like that, very often. The best case scenario? That the business has hit a true inflection point.I like to see top-line growth as an indication that growth is sustainable, and I look for a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin to point to a competitive moat (though some companies with low margins also have moats). Portobello maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 115% to €33m. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.

That makes it extra important to check on its balance sheet strength.Are Portobello Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Personally, I like to see high insider ownership of a company, since it suggests that it will be managed in the interests of shareholders. So as you can imagine, the fact that Portobello insiders own a significant number of shares certainly appeals to me. Indeed, with a collective holding of 76%, company insiders are in control and have plenty of capital behind the venture. This makes me think they will be incentivised to plan for the long term - something I like to see. With that sort of holding, insiders have about €19m riding on the stock, at current prices. That should be more than enough to keep them focussed on creating shareholder value!Is Portobello Worth Keeping An Eye On?Portobello's earnings have taken off like any random crypto-currency did, back in 2017. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders certainly brightens my view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point; and I do like those. So to my mind Portobello is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. Of course, just because Portobello is growing does not mean it is undervalued.
