The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Shougang Concord International Enterprises's TSR for the last year was 109%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Shougang Concord International Enterprises shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 109% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 2.8%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately.
