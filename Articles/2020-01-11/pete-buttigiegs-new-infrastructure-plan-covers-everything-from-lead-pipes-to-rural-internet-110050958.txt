He adds that “there is a realistic chance for a president who prioritizes infrastructure to get something done.” View photosCredit: David FosterMoreThe plan includes some details about how the mayor would pay for all of these proposals. A campaign spokesperson tells Yahoo Finance that measures like reforming the capital gains tax, repealing the Trump tax cuts, and reforming the estate tax would help pay for some these ideas. The plan also discusses a “new and sustainable user fee-based system” that could potentially replace the gas tax. Mayor Pete’s plan adds to a robust debate in the Democratic field that has featured a variety of ways to tackle an infrastructure problem. In Washington, there is bipartisan support for action, but little agreement on what measures to take or how to pay for it. Elizabeth Warren includes infrastructure under the umbrella of her green new deal plan. Former Vice President Joe Biden has a $1.3 trillion infrastructure plan that his campaign says will bolster the middle class.  View photosPresidential candidate Pete Buttigieg during a recent rally in Denver.

In office, he even briefly agreed to a $2 trillion infrastructure plan with Democrats that, before it fell apart, had no funding plans beyond bigger deficits.By comparison, the former South Bend Mayor’s plan has a smaller price tag and he emphasizes throughout how he would “make spending decisions that deliver the best value for local communities.”A focus on clean waterBefore it turns to traditional infrastructure concerns like roads, Mayor Pete’s plan focuses on clean water. The plan proposes a $100 billion fund that local communities could tap into “to address lead in water, paint, and soil.”All told, Buttigieg proposes around $170 billion in new spending on a variety of initiatives related to lead and clean water.The plan takes the position that “it is the government’s role and responsibility to have safe access to drinking water” says Klein, adding that Buttigieg is proposing solutions that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan brought to the forefront.Flint has been a national story since 2014 when changes in the water supply allowed lead to leech into the city's drinking water. The fallout from the scandal has led to charges against former Flint government officials. National politicians took notice with a Democratic presidential primary debate held in the city in 2016 (and a GOP primary debate held nearby).Story continuesView photosDemonstrators outside of the venue outside of the Democratic presidential debate in Flint in 2016.

The plan would infuse cash into cities for upgrades to existing public transportation systems and create another fund to encourage new public transportation options in rural communities.View photosPete Buttigieg campaign bus on a road near Elkader, Iowa in September.

The plan also allocates $10 billion to fund skill development at two- and four-year colleges and another $100 million to help job seekers from underrepresented communities.Ben Werschkul is the DC producer for Yahoo Finance.Read more:Pete Buttigieg has a big new plan to shake up the retirement systemHere's Michael Bloomberg's new 'All-In' economic agendaNew Warren plan takes aim at bankruptcy (and Biden)Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBarack Obama Demands Pro-Trump Group's Joe Biden Attack Ad Be Pulled for Misusing His VoicePeopleIowa Recount Confirms Buttigieg Caucus Win: Campaign UpdateBloombergDonald Trump Goes Off On Comcast At Cabinet Room Meeting: “They’re The Racists”DeadlineA Jewish president?
