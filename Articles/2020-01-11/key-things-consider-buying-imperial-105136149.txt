(CVE:IEI) For Its DividendSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we'll take a closer look at Imperial Equities Inc. (CVE:IEI) from a dividend investor's perspective. Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.Investors might not know much about Imperial Equities's dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last seven years and offers a 2.2% yield. While the yield may not look too great, the relatively long payment history is interesting. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 0.9% of market capitalisation this year. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Imperial Equities! TSXV:IEI Historical Dividend Yield, January 10th 2020MorePayout ratiosCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that of Imperial Equities's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.Is Imperial Equities's Balance Sheet Risky?As Imperial Equities has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). Imperial Equities has net debt of 10.77 times its EBITDA, which we think carries substantial risk if earnings aren't sustainable.Net interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Interest cover of 2.62 times its interest expense is starting to become a concern for Imperial Equities, and be aware that lenders may place additional restrictions on the company as well. High debt and weak interest cover are not a great combo, and we would be cautious of relying on this company's dividend while these metrics persist.Consider getting
our latest analysis on Imperial Equities's financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Looking at the data, we can see that Imperial Equities has been paying a dividend for the past seven years. It's good to see that Imperial Equities has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. Its most recent annual dividend was CA$0.10 per share, effectively flat on its first payment seven years ago.Story continuesWe're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments, we don't think this is an attractive combination.Dividend Growth PotentialWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? In the last five years, Imperial Equities's earnings per share have shrunk at approximately 3.4% per annum. A modest decline in earnings per share is not great to see, but it doesn't automatically make a dividend unsustainable. Still, we'd vastly prefer to see EPS growth when researching dividend stocks.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Imperial Equities's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. Firstly, we like that Imperial Equities has a low and conservative payout ratio. Second, earnings per share have been in decline, and its dividend has been cut at least once in the past. While we're not hugely bearish on it, overall we think there are potentially better dividend stocks than Imperial Equities out there.Now, if you want to look closer, it would be worth checking out our free research on Imperial Equities management tenure, salary, and performance.Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
