For example, the WASGAU Produktions & Handels AG (FRA:MSH) share price is up 48% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 17% (ignoring dividends). Check out our latest analysis for WASGAU Produktions & Handels There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).WASGAU Produktions & Handels's earnings per share are down 0.6% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.We doubt the modest 0.8% dividend yield is attracting many buyers to the stock. The revenue growth of 2.6% per year hardly seems impressive. So why is the share price up? It's not immediately obvious to us, but a closer look at the company's progress over time might yield answers.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).DB:MSH Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on WASGAU Produktions & Handels's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, WASGAU Produktions & Handels's TSR for the last 5 years was 56%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWASGAU Produktions & Handels shareholders are down 13% for the year (even including dividends) , but the market itself is up 21%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9.2% per year over half a decade.
