The fund just hit a 52-week high — up roughly 29.6% from its 52-week low of $33.20/share.Does it have more gains in store? Let’s take a look at the fund and its near-term outlook to gain an insight into where it might be headed:SPYG in FocusThe underlying S&P 500 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization growth sector in the U.S. equity market. The fund charges 4 bps in fees (see all Style Box - Large Cap Growth ETFs here).Why the Move?Wall Street rebounded soon after a wobbly start to the New Year (due to geopolitical tensions) as investors shrugged off fears of a possible escalation in Middle East tensions.
