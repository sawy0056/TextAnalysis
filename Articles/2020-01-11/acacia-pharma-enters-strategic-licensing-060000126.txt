(SIX:COPN) (“Cosmo”). The transaction grants to the Group exclusive US commercialisation rights to ByFavo™ (remimazolam) and has been made alongside an equity investment and debt facility by Cosmo to finance the marketing efforts of both BARHEMSYS® and ByFavo.A conference call will take place today, Friday 10 January 2020, at 14:00 CET/08:00 EST – details below.ByFavo is an ultra-short-acting and reversible intravenous sedative/anaesthetic and a New Drug Application (“NDA”) is currently under review by the US Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) with a target review (“PDUFA”) date of 5 April 2020.Mike Bolinder, CEO of Acacia Pharma, said: “We are delighted to have in-licensed ByFavo, which provides an excellent complementary product opportunity to BARHEMSYS. Having a second product that shares the same calling points and attractive commercial message as BARHEMSYS will make the investment in our sales and marketing teams more efficient and will allow us to deliver better treatment options for physicians and patients. The equity investment from Cosmo is a great validation of Acacia Pharma and strengthens our balance sheet as we move towards the PDUFA date for BARHEMSYS, which is targeted for 26 February 2020. The availability of debt finance is also important as it will allow us to invest in the anticipated launch and commercialisation of BARHEMSYS and ByFavo. I am sure we have found in Cosmo the right partner for our future expansion.”Alessandro Della Chà, CEO of Cosmo, said: “It took us more than six months of hard work to find the best possible US partner for ByFavo, following the same pattern as that of the RedHill transaction. We came to the conclusion that ByFavo, as much as Aemcolo, can better and faster achieve its sales potential within an organisation with significant commercial expertise and multiple products in the same market. If approved, both ByFavo and BARHEMSYS will share not only the same calling points but also the same compelling commercial message of reducing procedure and hospitalisation time. The deal gives Acacia Pharma the necessary means to boost its business focused on hospital and ambulatory surgical centre sales in the US and provides critical financing to accelerate its growth. This transaction is therefore consistent with our strategy to bundle our products into small and focussed companies in which we can have substantial equity stakes to participate in the potential growth in value. I am very satisfied by this synergy and I trust Acacia Pharma, with the help of Cosmo, will deliver the right reward both to its shareholders and to Paion as licensor, of which Cosmo also holds a major stake.”About the transactionUnder the principal terms of the in-license agreement, Cosmo will be eligible for:an upfront payment of €10 million from Acacia Pharma to be satisfied through the issue of 4,646,841 new ordinary shares of 2p in Acacia Pharma at €2.152 per share, being the 15-day volume weighted average share price up to 8 January 2020a €30 million payment from Acacia Pharma upon US approval of ByFavo, consisting of €15 million payable in cash and €15 million payable in cash or new ordinary shares at Acacia Pharma’s optiona €5 million payment upon first commercial sale of ByFavo in the US payable in cash or new ordinary shares at Acacia Pharma’s optionsales-related milestones of up to €105 million upon achieving pre-specified annual sales targets, andtiered double-digit royalties on US sales.Under the terms of the agreement, Cosmo has also made a strategic equity investment in Acacia Pharma of €10 million by agreeing to subscribe for 4,347,826 new ordinary shares of 2p in Acacia Pharma at a price of €2.30 per share, based on the closing price on 8 January 2020.

Approximately 24.5 million such procedures take place annually in the US, of which around 90% use moderate sedation.ByFavo has demonstrated efficacy and safety in an extensive clinical trial programme involving around 2,400 volunteers and patients. Data so far indicate that remimazolam has a rapid onset and offset of action combined with a good cardio-respiratory safety profile. ByFavo is designed to act more quickly than the available alternatives of the same pharmaceutical class for the same indication (e.g. midazolam) and can be reversed with flumazenil to rapidly terminate sedation or anaesthesia if necessary.Cosmo in-licensed the US rights to ByFavo from Paion AG in 2016 and together they have progressed the product candidate through to registration. The NDA for ByFavo, was submitted to the US FDA in April 2019 and has a target review (PDUFA) date of 5 April 2020.Conference CallA conference call will take place today at 14:00 CET/08:00 EST.
