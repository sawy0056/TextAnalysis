And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Subsea 7 share price has climbed 52% in five years, easily topping the market return of 29% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 13% in the last year , including dividends . Check out our latest analysis for Subsea 7 While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Subsea 7 actually saw its EPS drop 33% per year.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Because earnings per share don't seem to match up with the share price, we'll take a look at other metrics instead.We doubt the modest 1.4% dividend yield is attracting many buyers to the stock. It is not great to see that revenue has dropped by 12% per year over five years. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).OB:SUBC Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreSubsea 7 is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Subsea 7 will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Subsea 7, it has a TSR of 67% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Subsea 7 has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 13% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 11%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
