SGX:G92 Historical Dividend Yield, January 10th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. China Aviation Oil (Singapore) paid out 29% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Last year, China Aviation Oil (Singapore) paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.With a strong net cash balance, China Aviation Oil (Singapore) investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.Consider getting
our latest analysis on China Aviation Oil (Singapore)'s financial position here.Dividend VolatilityOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend.
