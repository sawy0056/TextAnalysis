Payments known as war risk premiums for tankers shuttling through the Strait of Hormuz could rise significantly, adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to shipping costs, after Iran's retaliatory strikes this week on Iraqi bases that house U.S. forces.China imported a record high monthly volume of LNG in December, overtaking Japan as the world's top importer of the fuel for a second consecutive month, ship tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon showed.But the surge in Chinese imports are due to the arrival of term volumes buyers committed to previously and spot volumes purchased earlier in the year, rather than a sudden rise in domestic demand, traders said.The rise in spot price was capped by exports from Angola and Brunei.Brunei's export plant offered a cargo for delivery in March, while Angola's project offered a cargo for delivery over late January to early February to as far as Singapore, sources said.Traders expect spot prices to drop to below $5 per mmBtu once winter demand eases.(Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
