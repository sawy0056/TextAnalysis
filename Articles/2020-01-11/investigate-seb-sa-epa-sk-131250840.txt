But is this actually reflective of the share value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at SEB’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for SEB Is SEB still cheap?Good news, investors! SEB is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is €184.44, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that SEB’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from SEB?ENXTPA:SK Past and Future Earnings, January 10th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
