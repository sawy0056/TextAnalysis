But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Rightmove plc (LON:RMV) stock is up an impressive 197% over the last five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 15% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 6.9% in the last three months. See our latest analysis for Rightmove In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Rightmove managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 24% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).LSE:RMV Past and Future Earnings, January 9th 2020MoreIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free interactive report on Rightmove's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Rightmove the TSR over the last 5 years was 215%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Rightmove shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 40% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 26% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.
