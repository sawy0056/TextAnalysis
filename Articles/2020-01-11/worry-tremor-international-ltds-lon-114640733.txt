View our latest analysis for Tremor International How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share (in the reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Tremor International:P/E of 27.48 = $2.19 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, USD ) ÷ $0.08 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each £1 the company has earned over the last year. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does Tremor International Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Tremor International has a higher P/E than the average (21.2) P/E for companies in the media industry.AIM:TRMR Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Tremor International shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat.

And over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have decreased 13% annually. This could justify a pessimistic P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).How Does Tremor International's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Tremor International has net cash of US$67m. This is fairly high at 25% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Bottom Line On Tremor International's P/E RatioTremor International's P/E is 27.5 which is above average (18.4) in its market. The recent drop in earnings per share would make some investors cautious, but the relatively strong balance sheet will allow the company time to invest in growth.
