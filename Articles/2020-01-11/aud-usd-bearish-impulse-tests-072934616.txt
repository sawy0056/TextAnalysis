Is a bullish reversal taking place or will the bears regain control?View photosDaily chartThe AUD/USD will be able to confirm the next direction depending on its reaction at the support line (blue) of the uptrend channel. A strong bullish bounce (green check) makes an uptrend likely whereas a bearish breakout would invalidate (red x) the current wave outlook.View photos4 hour chartThe AUD/USD made a deep retracement, which seems to have unfolded in an ABC (pink) zigzag pattern. A bearish breakout below the 100% FIbonacci level of wave 2 vs 1, however, invalidates (red x) the bullish wave pattern and indicates a downtrend. In that case, price made a bullish ABC rather then a 1-2 pattern. A bullish breakout, bounce, and continuation could make an uptrend more likely (green check).Good trading, Chris SvorcikThe analysis has been done with SWAT method (simple wave analysis and trading) For more daily technical and wave analysis and updates, sign-up up to our newsletterThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
