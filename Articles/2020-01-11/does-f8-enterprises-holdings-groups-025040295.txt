But unfortunately, the stock is still down by 16% over a quarter. However, that doesn't change the fact that longer term shareholders might have been mercilessly wrecked by the 63% share price decline throughout the year.All else being equal, a sharp share price increase should make a stock less attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth.

That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.F8 Enterprises (Holdings) Group shrunk earnings per share by 6.0% last year.

That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does F8 Enterprises (Holdings) Group's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?F8 Enterprises (Holdings) Group has net debt worth just 9.3% of its market capitalization.
