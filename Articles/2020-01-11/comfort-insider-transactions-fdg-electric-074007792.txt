The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So before you buy or sell FDG Electric Vehicles Limited (HKG:729), you may well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling.What Is Insider Buying?It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. See our latest analysis for FDG Electric Vehicles FDG Electric Vehicles Insider Transactions Over The Last Yearinsider Zheng Wang made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for HK$2.7m worth of shares at a price of HK$0.21 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is HK$0.22. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value.
