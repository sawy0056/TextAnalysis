KGaA's (ETR:KSB) P/E Is Telling UsSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosThe goal of this article is to teach you how to use price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll look at KSB SE & Co. KGaA's (ETR:KSB) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. KSB SE KGaA has a P/E ratio of 18.77, based on the last twelve months. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying €18.77 for every €1 in prior year profit. View our latest analysis for KSB SE KGaA How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for KSB SE KGaA:P/E of 18.77 = €304.00 ÷ €16.19 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each €1 the company has earned over the last year. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does KSB SE KGaA's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. As you can see below, KSB SE KGaA has a higher P/E than the average company (16.9) in the machinery industry.XTRA:KSB Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively high P/E ratio indicates that KSB SE KGaA shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.KSB SE KGaA's 272% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. Regrettably, the longer term performance is poor, with EPS down 11% per year over 5 years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).KSB SE KGaA's Balance SheetWith net cash of €189m, KSB SE KGaA has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 36% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On KSB SE KGaA's P/E RatioKSB SE KGaA has a P/E of 18.8. That's below the average in the DE market, which is 20.6. It grew its EPS nicely over the last year, and the healthy balance sheet implies there is more potential for growth. The below average P/E ratio suggests that market participants don't believe the strong growth will continue. Because analysts are predicting more growth in the future, one might have expected to see a higher P/E ratio.
