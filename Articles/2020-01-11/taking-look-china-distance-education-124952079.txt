With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine China Distance Education Holdings Limited (NYSE:DL), by way of a worked example.Our data shows China Distance Education Holdings has a return on equity of 13% for the last year. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each $1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made $0.13 in profit. Check out our latest analysis for China Distance Education Holdings How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for China Distance Education Holdings:13% = US$16m ÷ US$124m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most readers would understand what net profit is, but it’s worth explaining the concept of shareholders’ equity. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the yearly profit. A higher profit will lead to a higher ROE. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. That means it can be interesting to compare the ROE of different companies.Does China Distance Education Holdings Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that China Distance Education Holdings has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Consumer Services industry (12%).NYSE:DL Past Revenue and Net Income, January 10th 2020MoreThat's not overly surprising. ROE tells us about the quality of the business, but it does not give us much of an idea if the share price is cheap.

That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.China Distance Education Holdings's Debt And Its 13% ROEWhile China Distance Education Holdings does have some debt, with debt to equity of just 0.31, we wouldn't say debt is excessive. The combination of modest debt and a very respectable ROE suggests this is a business worth watching. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Story continuesBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.
