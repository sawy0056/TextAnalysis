This is because the companies have constrained capital expenditure programs as shareholders demand lower spending on production and instead focus more on returns.Conservative Capital ProgramOil explorers and producers in the U.S. shale plays have been removing rigs since they have been facing constant investor pressure for higher returns. In 2019, the upstream energy players removed roughly 200 rigs from American oil resources, per data provided by oilfield service firm Baker Hughes Company BKR. Notably, Permian — the most prolific shale resource in the United States which has helped the country become energy independence — witnessed the removal of roughly 82 oil rigs in 2019.The shale operators have also decided to continue to curb spending on drilling new wells, which has slowed their overall production. Despite a relatively favorable crude pricing scenario, domestic oil explorers and producers have cut down on spending just to generate sufficient free cashflow for shareholders.Impressive Free Cashflow in the CardsFree cashflow is derived after subtracting capital spending from net cash from operations. The continued restraint in capital spending has increased the possibility for U.S. shale players to generate incremental free cashflows in 2020.Analysts are reportedly optimistic about higher investor returns from shale players since shareholders recently approved Parsley Energy Inc’s PE $1.8-billion acquisition of rival Jagged Peak Energy Inc JAG. It might be the case that shareholders are optimistic that even after spending on mergers and acquisitions, domestic shale companies will have sufficient free cashflows to reward stockholders with dividends and share repurchases.Shale Players to GainGiven that shale drillers will probably generate handsome free cashflows in 2020, it would be ideal to keep an eye on the following Permian explorers that are poised to gain.
