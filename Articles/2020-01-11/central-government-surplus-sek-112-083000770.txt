The Debt Office's forecast from October was a surplus of SEK 113 billion.The relatively large surplus is partly explained by the Riksbank’s repayments of loans of equivalent to SEK 69 billion in foreign currency to the Debt Office. The economic development in 2019 was characterized by weaker growth. This contributed to tax income from, for example, wages and consumption growing more slowly than in previous years. The Debt Office estimates that capital investments in tax accounts decreased slightly during the year, while at the same time contributing to greater variations in central government payments.Overall, government expenditure increased moderately compared to 2018. Labour market and migration expenditures decreased the most, while government grants to local governments increased the most.Central government debt amounted to SEK 1,113 billion at the end of December, which was SEK 149 billion lower than in December 2018.Deficit for central government in DecemberSwedish central government payments resulted in a deficit of SEK 98.4 billion in December. The Debt Office's forecast was a deficit of SEK 87.2 billion. This was mainly due to tax income being approximately SEK 15 billion lower than estimated, which was caused by lower supplementary tax payments and higher payments from tax accounts than expected. In total during the period October to December, tax income were approximately SEK 13 billion lower than forecast. This was mainly due to higher payments from tax accounts.The Debt Office’s net lending to government agencies etc. was SEK 0.2 billion lower than forecasted.Interest payments on central government debt were SEK 1.3 billion higher than forecasted.The outcome for January will be published on 7 February at 9.30 a.m.ContactTord Arvidsson, Analyst, +46 (0)8 613 47 53Press Secretary, +46 (0)8 613 47 01 Budget balance and central government net borrowing requirement1 (SEK million)
