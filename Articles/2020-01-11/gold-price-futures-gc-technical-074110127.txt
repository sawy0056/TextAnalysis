A jump in U.S. Treasury yields is also helping to make the U.S. Dollar a more attractive asset while weighing on foreign demand for dollar-denominated gold.At 06:34 GMT, February Comex gold futures are trading $1548.40, down $5.90 or -0.38%.Daily February Comex GoldMoreDaily Swing Chart Technical AnalysisThe main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. However, momentum is trending lower. A trade through $1613.30 will signal a resumption of the uptrend. The main trend will change to down on a move through the last swing bottom at $1463.00. This is followed by a pair of main bottoms at $1456.60 and $1453.10.The closing price reversal top on January 8 and its subsequent confirmation on January 9 shifted momentum to the downside. This often leads to a 2 to 3 day counter-trend sell-off or a 50% to 61.8% retracement zone of the last rally.The minor trend is down. It turned down on January 8 when sellers took out the minor bottom at $1557.00. This move also signaled a shift in momentum to down.The main range is $1453.10 to $1613.30. Its retracement zone at $1533.20 to $1514.30 is the downside target.Daily Swing Chart Technical ForecastTraders should prepare for two moves.The first is a further decline into $1533.20 to $1514.30. Look for buyers on the first test of this zone. Trader reaction to a test of this zone will determine the near-term direction of the market.The second move to watch for is the retracement of the break from $1613.30 to $1541.00. Its retracement zone at $1577.20 to $1585.70 is the upside target. Counter-trend sellers could come in on this move. They will be trying to form a secondary lower top.In the absence of any escalation of the situation in the Middle East, the catalyst behind the price action on Friday is likely to be the U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report, due to be released at 13:30 GMT.Look for gold to break into the support zone if the report is strong. Treasury yields should rise along with the U.S. Dollar and demand for risky assets.A weaker-than-expected report could send gold prices into the upside retracement zone.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:
