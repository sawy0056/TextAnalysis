Potter projects 112,000 deliveries in 2020 with that number ramping up to 399,000 in 2022.Tesla, for its part, has said it hopes to produce 250,000 vehicles at its Shanghai Gigafactory each year.Dan Ives, managing director at the Los Angeles-based investment bank Wedbush Securities, says that while recent price cuts in China will help, “competition on the electric vehicle front remains fierce in the country, with a number of lower-price alternatives.”Tesla is making its initial foray into the country as one of its biggest electric-vehicle competitors there bleeds cash. Nio, often referred to as the “Tesla of China,” lost $352.8 million in the third quarter, slashing its cash balance to $274.3 million. The company said continuing to operate depends on its ability to “obtain sufficient external equity or debt-financing.”Other electric-vehicle makers in the country include the Warren Buffett-backed BYD, Volvo-parent Geely Automotive Group and Volkswagen and GM partner SAIC Motor.“2020 represents a pivotal year for Musk & Co., as ultimately this will be the year the bulls have been waiting for, with China coming on board and Musk’s grand electric vehicle vision" starting to take hold, he said. There's also a chance, though, that the company "hits another stumble," Ives wrote Thursday, in which case "the bears will come quickly out of hibernation mode." He maintained his “neutral” rating and a $370 price target.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSTesla shares climbed 15.1 percent this year through Thursday.Related ArticlesBest Buy Celebrates 50 Yrs With Saleathon; Will It Turn 60?Canadian Solar Is Facing More Challenges Than It AppearsTarget Adds Private Bathrooms to Quell Transgender DebateReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextVirus detected in sub-Saharan Africa, global stocks tankAFPKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergVirus game 'Plague' app pulled in China: developerAFPJapan's January factory output beats forecasts but slowdown expectedReutersBTS cancel concerts as South Korea coronavirus cases pass 2,000AFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
