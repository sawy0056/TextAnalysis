Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Mack-Cali Realty (NYSE:CLI), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now, I'm not saying that the stock is necessarily undervalued today; but I can't shake an appreciation for the profitability of the business itself. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for Mack-Cali Realty How Quickly Is Mack-Cali Realty Increasing Earnings Per Share?As one of my mentors once told me, share price follows earnings per share (EPS). Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. I, for one, am blown away by the fact that Mack-Cali Realty has grown EPS by 38% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but like a lotus blooming from a murky pond, it sparks joy for the wary stock pickers.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. I note that Mack-Cali Realty's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort my analysis of its margins. To cut to the chase Mack-Cali Realty's EBIT margins dropped last year, and so did its revenue. That will not make it easy to grow profits, to say the least.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.We haven't seen any insiders selling Mack-Cali Realty shares, in the last year. With that in mind, it's heartening that Alan Batkin, the of the company, paid US$48k for shares at around US$23.95 each.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Mack-Cali Realty bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. To be specific, they have US$18m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Despite being just 0.8% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Does Mack-Cali Realty Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Mack-Cali Realty's earnings have taken off like any random crypto-currency did, back in 2017. The incing on the cake is that insiders own a large chunk of the company and one has even been buying more shares. Because of the potential that it has reached an inflection point, I'd suggest Mack-Cali Realty belongs on the top of your watchlist.
