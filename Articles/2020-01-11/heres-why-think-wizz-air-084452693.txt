But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.In the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, my choice may seem old fashioned; I still prefer profitable companies like Wizz Air Holdings (LON:WIZZ). While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. Check out our latest analysis for Wizz Air Holdings How Quickly Is Wizz Air Holdings Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so share price follows earnings per share (EPS) eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Wizz Air Holdings grew its EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of Wizz Air Holdings's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers I've used might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Wizz Air Holdings maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 21% to €2.6b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time.
