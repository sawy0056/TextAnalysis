(NYSE:CAT) Potentially Undervalued?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we're going to take a look at the well-established Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Caterpillar’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Caterpillar What's the opportunity in Caterpillar?Great news for investors – Caterpillar is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $185.35, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Caterpillar’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Caterpillar?NYSE:CAT Past and Future Earnings, January 10th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
