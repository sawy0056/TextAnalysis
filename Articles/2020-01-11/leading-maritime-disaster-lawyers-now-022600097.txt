Robert J. Mongeluzzi, of SMBB, previously criticized  Truth Aquatics, Inc., the boat's  owner, for engaging in a "cruel and heartless ploy" when just a few days after the tragedy – and before all the bodies had been recovered – filed a federal lawsuit seeking to limit the company's financial exposure under an archaic 1851 shipowners' shield  law.  SMBB (www.smbb.com) and PSB (www.psblaw.com) are among the nation's premier catastrophic personal injury law firms, whose litany of major cases include maritime disasters, from duck boats on lakes and rivers to cruise ships at sea. SMBB most recently represents numerous victims of the 2018 Branson, Missouri duck boat disaster that resulted in 17 deaths. In that case the firm successfully argued that the 1851 Limitation of Liability Act did not apply to the boat's owner. PSB, as part of its wide-ranging plaintiff's practice, presently serves as lead counsel in both the Thomas Fire and Woolsey Fire litigations in Southern California as well as lead trial counsel in litigation against Southern California Gas Company, representing thousands of victims of the 2015 Aliso Canyon Gas Leak in Porter Ranch, California.When & Where10 a.m., Monday, January 13, 2020Panish Shea & Boyle LLP11111 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 700, Los Angeles, CA 90025Presenting AttorneysRobert J.
