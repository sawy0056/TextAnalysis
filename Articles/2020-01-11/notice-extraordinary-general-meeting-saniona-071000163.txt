Through the implementation of a share based incentive program, the future value growth in the company is encouraged, which implies common interests and goals for the shareholders of the company and the CEO. Such share based incentive program is also expected to increase Saniona’s possibilities to retain competent persons.A.         The board of directors’ proposal to resolution on Employee Option Program 2020/2025The board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to adopt the Employee Option Program 2020/2025 in accordance with the following substantial guidelines:Story continuesThe Employee Option Program 2020/2025 shall be comprised by a maximum of 710,313 employee options.Each employee option entitles the holder a right to acquire one new share in the company against cash consideration at a subscription price amounting to 100 per cent of the average closing price of the company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during ten trading days prior to the extraordinary general meeting on 7 February 2020. The thus calculated subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre, whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The subscription price and the number of shares that each employee option entitles right to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue etc., wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied.The Employee Option Program 2020/2025 shall only comprise the CEO.Allotment shall take place no later than as of 31 March 2020.  The allotted employee options will be vested with 1/4 each at the dates falling 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after allotment. Vesting requires that the participant is still operational within the Saniona Group as of the date when the respective vesting occurs. If the participant ceases to be operational within the Saniona Group after a vesting date has occurred, but before the last date of exercise, the already vested employee options may be exercised on the ordinary dates of exercise, but further vesting will not take place.The employee options shall not constitute securities and shall not be able to be transferred or pledged. However, in the event of death, the rights constituted by the employee options shall accrue to the beneficiaries of the holder of the employee options.The employee options shall be allotted without consideration. The holder can exercise allotted and vested employee options during 30 days from the day following after the announcement of the company’s quarterly reports, or for full year, the year-end report, the first time after the announcement of the quarterly report for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the last time after the announcement of the quarterly report for the third quarter of 2025. If the company does not render any quarterly report or year-end report after the end of any calendar quarter, the allotted and vested employee options may instead be exercised during the last month of the following calendar quarter, the first time in March 2023 and the last time in December 2025.In the event of a public take-over offer, asset sale, liquidation, merger or any other such transaction affecting the company, the employee options will vest in their entirety and be exercisable in connection with the relevant transaction.Participation in the Employee Option Program 2020/2025 requires that such participation is in accordance with applicable laws, as well as that such participation can take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts according to the company’s opinion.The employee options shall be governed by separate agreements with the participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Employee Option Program 2020/2025 within the above mentioned substantial terms and guidelines, and by taking into account such minor adjustments that may be required due to local legal or administrative conditions. In extraordinary cases, the board of directors is entitled to limit the extent of, or terminate the Employee Option Program 2020/2025 in advance, in whole or in part.The board of directors’ proposal to resolution on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants In order to enable the company’s delivery of shares under the Employee Option Program 2020/2025, the board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves on a directed issue of a maximum of 710,313 warrants in accordance with the following terms and conditions:The warrants shall be issued without consideration and the warrants may only, with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights, be subscribed for by the subsidiary, Saniona A/S (the “Subsidiary”). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights and the reason for that the warrants are issued without consideration are due to that the warrants are issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2020/2025. In light of the above, the board of directors considers that it is for the benefit of the company and its shareholders that the CEO is offered to participate in the Employee Option Program 2020/2025.Subscription shall be made no later than as of 31 March 2020. The board of directors shall be entitled to postpone the last day for subscription.Each warrant entitles the holder a right to acquire one new share in the company against cash consideration at a subscription price amounting to 100 per cent of the average closing price of the company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during ten trading days prior to the extraordinary general meeting on 7 February 2020. The subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre, whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles right to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue etc.The warrants may be exercised during the time period from and including the registration of the warrants at the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) to and including 31 December 2025.The shares issued upon exercise of a warrant shall confer right to dividends as from the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs following effectuation of the subscription to such extent that the shares have been recorded as interim shares in the company’s share ledger.If all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares, the share capital will increase with SEK 35,515.65.The company’s chairman of the board of directors shall be entitled to make such minor adjustments of the issue resolution that might be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Further, the board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting shall resolve to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to the participants in the Employee Option Program 2020/2025 without consideration in connection with the exercise of employee options in accordance with the terms and conditions under Section A above.Other information regarding the Employee Option Program 2020/2025The proposal of the Employee Option Program 2020/2025 has been prepared by the board of directors of the company.The Employee Option Program 2020/2025 will be accounted for in accordance with “IFRS 2 – Share based payments”. IFRS 2 stipulates that the options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company’s cash flow. The board of directors has made the assessment that the Employee Option Program 2020/2025 will not trigger any social costs for the company.The employee options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However, the board of directors has calculated a theoretical value of the employee options using the “Black Scholes” formula. Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of the options of SEK 29 and that 100 per cent of the options are vested, the total cost for the Employee Option Program 2020/2025 is estimated to approximately SEK 9.5 million before tax during the period 2020-2025 calculated in accordance with the Black Scholes formula, according to IFRS 2.It shall be noted that the calculations are based on preliminary assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of the outcome.As per the date of the notice, the number of shares in the company amounts to 28,412,519. After the registration of the directed new issue that the board of directors has resolved on this day, the number of shares in the company will amount to 29,412,519.In case all warrants that are issued in relation to the Employee Option Program 2020/2025 are exercised for subscription of shares, a total of 710,313 shares will be issued, which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 2.36 per cent of the company’s share capital and votes after full dilution, calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all warrants which have been issued in relation to the Employee Option Program 2020/2025. The dilution is only expected to have a marginal effect on the company’s key ratio “Earnings per share before taxes”.Currently, there are incentive programs in the form of three employee option programs and three option programs for certain members of the board of directors outstanding in the company, in relation to which warrants have been issued. For further information regarding the existing incentive programs, please see “Share Based Payments” in note 4 in the quarterly report for the third quarter 2019. In case all outstanding warrants as well as the warrants proposed to be issued upon resolution by the extraordinary general meeting are exercised for subscription of shares, a total of 1,137,744 new shares will be issued, which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.72 per cent of the company’s share capital and votes after full dilution, calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all outstanding and proposed warrants related to incentive programs.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to re-calculation of the warrants in accordance with the customary recalculation terms included in the applicable warrant terms.Particular majority requirementsFor a valid resolution on the proposal pursuant to item 6, the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting. For a valid resolution on the proposal pursuant to item 8, the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting.Information at the meetingThe board of directors and the CEO shall at the meeting, if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the company, provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of items on the agenda.Provision of documentsThe board of directors’ complete proposals for resolutions and ancillary documents pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen) will be available at the company’s office at Baltorpvej 154, DK-2750 Ballerup, Denmark and at the company’s website (www.saniona.com) as from no later than three weeks before the meeting, and will also be sent to shareholders who request it and state their address.
