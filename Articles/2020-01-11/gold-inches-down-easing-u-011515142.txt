The instability over that is causing all the volatility," said Jeffrey Sica, founder of Circle Squared Alternative Investments.With the sanctions its becoming obvious that there is going to be even economic consequences, Sica added.Gold, often considered a safe investment during political and economic turmoil, surged above $1,600 on Wednesday after Iran launched missile strikes on U.S. forces in retaliation for the killing of its top commander in a drone attack.However, prices retreated 4% after the two sides softened their stance."The pullback that we saw the last couple of days gave people an opportunity to buy today," said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors."There's some resistance at $1,562 but if it trades up through there, that's going to be a key level to where short-term traders are going to be involved."Meanwhile, data from the U.S. Labor Department showed job growth slowed more than expected in December helping prop up the bullion further.The U.S. dollar also fell from four-week highs against the safe-haven yen and slid versus the Swiss franc on the possibility of renewed tensions in the Middle East.
