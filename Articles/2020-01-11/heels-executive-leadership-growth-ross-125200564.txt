Most recently he served as Senior Vice President of Sales at SquareTrade, where he was accountable for more than half a billion in revenue across the Americas and was instrumental in scaling the company into a world-class selling organization after it was acquired by Allstate Corporation. Prior to that, Lipari was Head of Sales for Luma Home and, previously, served as Head of Sales, Americas for Google-owned Nest Labs.Lipari began his career with the consumer packaged goods and retail team at Accenture. He also held leadership roles of increasing responsibility at MillerCoors (later SABMiller) for more than a decade. As Vice President of Sales, Grocery Channel for MillerCoors, Lipari led the entire US grocery channel, representing approximately $1.5 billion in revenue. Later as Vice President of Sales with SABM Latin America, he led sales across all channels (grocery, convenience, club stores, bars, restaurants) for Latin America and Canada, accounting for more than $500 million in revenue. Among his many accomplishments was the implementation of new assortment, merchandising, execution and shopper marketing solutions with key grocers, including Wal-Mart, Exito, Makro and SuperSelectos, which resulted in significant revenue growth and category share improvement. Lipari joins a team of seasoned consumer packaged goods executives led by Chief Executive Officer, David Kroll, who was appointed in the fall of 2019.
