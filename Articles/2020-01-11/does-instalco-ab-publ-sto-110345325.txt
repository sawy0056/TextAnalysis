See our latest analysis for Instalco How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Instalco:P/E of 17.43 = SEK129.60 ÷ SEK7.43 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.How Does Instalco's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. The image below shows that Instalco has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the construction industry average (17.4).OM:INSTAL Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts P/E ratio suggests that Instalco shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification. The company could surprise by performing better than average, in the future. I would further inform my view by checking insider buying and selling., among other things.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Instalco's 64% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. And earnings per share have improved by 56% annually, over the last three years. So you might say it really deserves to have an above-average P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Instalco's Balance SheetInstalco has net debt worth 12% of its market capitalization. This could bring some additional risk, and reduce the number of investment options for management; worth remembering if you compare its P/E to businesses without debt.The Verdict On Instalco's P/E RatioInstalco's P/E is 17.4 which is below average (19.5) in the SE market. The EPS growth last year was strong, and debt levels are quite reasonable. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
