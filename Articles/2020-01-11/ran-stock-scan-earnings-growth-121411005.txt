Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Piscines Desjoyaux (EPA:ALPDX). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Conversely, a loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the sweet milk of external capital may run sour. View our latest analysis for Piscines Desjoyaux How Fast Is Piscines Desjoyaux Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Piscines Desjoyaux has managed to grow EPS by 27% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away winners.I like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Piscines Desjoyaux shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 8.8% to 14%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

I discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Piscines Desjoyaux with market caps under €180m is about €281k.The Piscines Desjoyaux CEO received €165k in compensation for the year ending August 2019. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given its below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation isn't a huge factor in my view of the company, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add Piscines Desjoyaux To Your Watchlist?For growth investors like me, Piscines Desjoyaux's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. The fast growth bodes well while the very reasonable CEO pay assists builds some confidence in the board. So I'd argue this is the kind of stock worth watching, even if it isn't great value today. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Piscines Desjoyaux is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Story continuesYou can invest in any company you want.
