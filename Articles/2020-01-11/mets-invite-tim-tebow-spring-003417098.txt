Tebow hit just .163 while playing at the Triple-A level in 2019 and isn’t considered a major league prospect, but he remains a major draw at the ticket gate.It’s difficult to isolate his exact impact, but Tebow’s presence has regularly contributed to increased attendance for the Mets’ minor league affiliates. With Tebow on the roster, the Triple-A Syracuse Mets had an 18 percent increase in average attendance in 2019 compared to the previous year.NFL PERSONAL SEAT LICENSES: PIGSKIN PONZI OR GOOD INVESTMENT?In 2017, Tebow spent time with the Low-A Columbia Fireflies and the High-A Port St. Lucie Mets. Columbia’s average attendance jumped about 40 percent that season, and Port St. Lucie broke its season record for total home attendance, according to SNY."The Tebow effect" wasn’t limited to the Mets. Baseball America calculated Tebow’s presence led to an average attendance spike of 2,591 fans for road games during his stint with Columbia, boosting revenue for opposing home teams by a cumulative $1.6 million.LEGAL SPORTS BETTING: CALIFORNIA AMONG STATES SET FOR 2020 PUSHTebow established close ties to the Florida area, the Mets’ spring training locale, during his football career.
