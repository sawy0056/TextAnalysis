Nothing says comfortable retirement quite like living next door to your favorite golf course or fishing hole, after all. But one piece of the retirement-planning puzzle that can easily be overlooked is taxes. Though it might seem less important than the aforementioned factors, a high tax rate will deplete your nest egg faster than you can say, “But my favorite golf course is in Minneapolis!” So, it’s important to know what your ideal retirement city’s tax situation looks like.In order to determine the most and least tax-friendly cities for retirees, GOBankingRates examined the 50 biggest U.S. cities in terms of population size and scored them across five factors: estimated total taxes paid annually in retirement, the effective retirement tax rate in the state, the amount paid in property taxes annually, the estimated property tax rate and sales tax. Though many of the most tax-friendly cities owe their spot on the list to a 0% tax rate, a lack of retirement taxes didn’t necessarily make a city “tax-friendly.” For example, Austin, Texas, despite its 0% tax rate, wound up as one of the least tax-friendly cities due to a high sales tax and annual property taxes more than three times the U.S. average.Whether your retirement is years down the road or just around the corner, it’s important to know how taxes will affect your outlook. Starting with the most tax-friendly cities for retirees, learn the best and worst places to retire when it comes to taxes.Last updated: Jan. 10, 20201.

See If This Plan Is Right for YouCitibank Review: One-Stop BankingBest Online Banks of 2020Retirees Confess What They Wish They’d Done With Their MoneyTo determine the most and least tax-friendly cities for retirees, GOBankingRates looked at the 50 biggest cities in the U.S. by population according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 Population Estimates and scored them on the following factors: (1) estimated total amount paid in retirement taxes annually (this figure was calculated by state through SmartAsset‘s Retirement Tax Friendliness calculator, assuming a single filer turning 65 in 2020, receiving the national average annual amount in retirement benefits, sourced from the Social Security Administration’s November 2019 Monthly Statistical Snapshot, and collecting the majority of their income from a retirement account — assuming retirement benefits account for 33% of total income, as estimated by the SSA Fact Sheet); (2) the effective retirement tax rate in each state, calculated as the percentage of total income paid in retirement taxes; (3) the average amount paid in property taxes annually, calculated by using Tax-Rates.org‘s Property Tax Calculator to apply the appropriate county, parish or district’s tax rates to the estimated median home value for each city, as sourced from Zillow’s October 2019 Housing Data; (4) the estimated property tax rate in its county, parish or district from Tax-Rates.org; and (5) the sales tax rate in each city, according to Avalara. All 50 cities were then ranked according to their scores on the above five factors, with sales tax weighted at 1/2 times the other factors. Note: Detroit was excluded due to a lack of data. All data used to conduct this study was compiled and verified on Dec. 16, 2019, and is subject to change.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: The Most and Least Tax-Friendly Cities for RetireesReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
