This makes investing attractive. But if you choose that path, you're going to buy some stocks that fall short of the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Mayfield Childcare Limited (ASX:MFD) share price is up 11% in the last year, that falls short of the market return. Zooming out, the stock is actually down 1.5% in the last three years. See our latest analysis for Mayfield Childcare In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the last year, Mayfield Childcare actually saw its earnings per share drop 8.7%.Given the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.For starters, we suspect the share price has been buoyed by the dividend, which was increased during the year. Income-seeking investors probably helped bid up the stock price. Though we must add that the revenue growth of 14% year on year would have helped paint a pretty picture.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).ASX:MFD Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Mayfield Childcare's TSR for the last year was 21%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveMayfield Childcare shareholders are up 21% for the year (even including dividends) . Unfortunately this falls short of the market return of around 24%. On the other hand, the TSR over three years was worse, at just 4.9% per year. This suggests the company's position is improving. If the business can justify the share price gain with improving fundamental data, then there could be more gains to come.
