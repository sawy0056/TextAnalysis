As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on HelloFresh’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for HelloFresh What is HelloFresh worth?According to my valuation model, HelloFresh seems to be fairly priced at around 0.6% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy HelloFresh today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth €20.09, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since HelloFresh’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will HelloFresh generate?XTRA:HFG Past and Future Earnings, January 10th 2020MoreInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. In HelloFresh’s case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 64%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What this means for you:Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in HFG’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on HFG, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Price is just the tip of the iceberg.
