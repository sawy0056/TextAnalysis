In addition to driving top and bottom line results, the development of the executive team has always been a top priority. Throughout this period, I have worked very closely with Robert to identify and drive our Company’s strategic initiatives and our strong financial results speak to our success. I am fully confident Robert is the right choice to lead the TopBuild team and continue our momentum into the future.”Covington added, “Over the past four and a half years as President and Chief Operating Officer, Robert has clearly demonstrated his strength as a business leader.

As we initiate this transition, which should be a seamless process for all stakeholders, the Board and I are confident Robert and his team are well-positioned to take TopBuild into the future.” Covington noted that Buck’s appointment was the result of a thoughtful and comprehensive succession planning process by the Board.Robert Buck stated, “I am honored to be named the next CEO of TopBuild and want to thank both Jerry and the Board for the confidence they have placed in me to lead this strong organization.
