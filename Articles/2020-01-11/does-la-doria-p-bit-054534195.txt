(BIT:LD) and reflect on its potential as an investment. To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for La Doria:0.087 = €34m ÷ (€640m - €246m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, La Doria has an ROCE of 8.7%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts.

Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.La Doria has total liabilities of €246m and total assets of €640m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 38% of its total assets. La Doria's middling level of current liabilities have the effect of boosting its ROCE a bit.The Bottom Line On La Doria's ROCEUnfortunately, its ROCE is still uninspiring, and there are potentially more attractive prospects out there.
