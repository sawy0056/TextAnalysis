But that is small recompense for the exasperating returns over three years. In that time, the share price dropped 61%. So it is really good to see an improvement. Perhaps the company has turned over a new leaf. View our latest analysis for McGrath Because McGrath made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.In the last three years McGrath saw its revenue shrink by 16% per year. That means its revenue trend is very weak compared to other loss making companies. Arguably, the market has responded appropriately to this business performance by sending the share price down 27% (annualized) in the same time period. When revenue is dropping, and losses are still costing, and the share price sinking fast, it's fair to ask if something is remiss. After losing money on a declining business with falling stock price, we always consider whether eager bagholders are still offering us a reasonable exit price.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).ASX:MEA Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of McGrath's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveMcGrath shareholders are up 21% for the year. It's always nice to make money but this return falls short of the market return which was about 24% for the year. The silver lining is that the recent rise is far preferable to the annual loss of 26% that shareholders have suffered over the last three years. It could well be that the business is stabilizing.
