The jump in hiring in November was aided by the end of a strike by workers at General Motors that caused the number of manufacturing jobs to climb by 54,000.Expectations for the employment report were amplified by a report Wednesday from payroll processor ADP that showed private companies added 202,000 jobs in December. Still, the ADP report often varies from the government's more comprehensive surveys.U.S. employers added 1.98 million jobs through the first 11 months of 2019. That's a solid number, although hiring may slow because the number of unemployed people seeking work has fallen to 5.8 million, the lowest level since 2000. With fewer unemployed people hunting for jobs, hiring might slow organically.The steady hiring growth during the expansion has contributed to gains in consumer spending. Retail sales during the crucial holiday shopping improved 3.4% compared to the prior year, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.But online shopping accounted for much of that increase as e-commerce sales rose nearly 19%. Retailers have shed roughly 30,000 jobs in the 12-month period that ended in November because of this shift.Manufacturing struggled last year because of trade tensions between the United States and China coupled with slower global economic growth. Hiring in the sector has declined as a result.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNew Home Sales Raced to a 12.5-Year High: 5 Big WinnersZacksWhy Spain Can’t Shake One of World’s Highest Unemployment RatesBloombergWhat?
