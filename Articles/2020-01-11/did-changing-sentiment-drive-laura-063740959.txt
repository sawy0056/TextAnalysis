But will that repair the damage for the weary investors who have owned this stock as it declined over half a decade? Probably not. Indeed, the share price is down a whopping 88% in that time. While the recent increase might be a green shoot, we're certainly hesitant to rejoice. The fundamental business performance will ultimately determine if the turnaround can be sustained.We really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio. Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson. See our latest analysis for Laura Ashley Holdings Given that Laura Ashley Holdings didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.In the last five years Laura Ashley Holdings saw its revenue shrink by 5.1% per year. That's not what investors generally want to see. The share price fall of 35% (per year, over five years) is a stern reminder that money-losing companies are expected to grow revenue. We're generally averse to companies with declining revenues, but we're not alone in that. Fear of becoming a 'bagholder' may be keeping people away from this stock.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).LSE:ALY Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreBalance sheet strength is crucial. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered Laura Ashley Holdings's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Its history of dividend payouts mean that Laura Ashley Holdings's TSR, which was a 86% drop over the last 5 years, was not as bad as the share price return.A Different PerspectiveLaura Ashley Holdings provided a TSR of 2.2% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 33% endured over half a decade. It could well be that the business is stabilizing.
