This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other companies that have similar market capitalization. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. And finally - as a second measure of performance - we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid. Check out our latest analysis for Comtec Solar Systems Group How Does Zhen Zhang's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?At the time of writing, our data says that Comtec Solar Systems Group Limited has a market cap of HK$79m, and reported total annual CEO compensation of CN¥974k for the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at CN¥853k. We took a group of companies with market capitalizations below CN¥1.4b, and calculated the median CEO total compensation to be CN¥1.6m.This would give shareholders a good impression of the company, since most similar size companies have to pay more, leaving less for shareholders. While this is a good thing, you'll need to understand the business better before you can form an opinion.The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at Comtec Solar Systems Group has changed from year to year.SEHK:712 CEO Compensation, January 10th 2020MoreIs Comtec Solar Systems Group Limited Growing?Comtec Solar Systems Group Limited has increased its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 64% a year, over the last three years (using a line of best fit). It saw its revenue drop 49% over the last year.This demonstrates that the company has been improving recently. A good result. The lack of revenue growth isn't ideal, but it is the bottom line that counts most in business. We don't have analyst forecasts, but you might want to assess this data-rich visualization of earnings, revenue and cash flow.Has Comtec Solar Systems Group Limited Been A Good Investment?With a three year total loss of 91%, Comtec Solar Systems Group Limited would certainly have some dissatisfied shareholders. So shareholders would probably think the company shouldn't be too generous with CEO compensation.In Summary...It looks like Comtec Solar Systems Group Limited pays its CEO less than similar sized companies.Many would consider this to indicate that the pay is modest since the business is growing. Unfortunately, some shareholders may be disappointed with their returns, given the company's performance over the last three years. So while we would not say that Zhen Zhang is generously paid, it would be good to see an improvement in business performance before too an increase in pay.
