See our latest analysis for Boot Barn Holdings There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Boot Barn Holdings achieved compound earnings per share growth of 52% per year. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 59% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).NYSE:BOOT Past and Future Earnings, January 10th 2020MoreIt is of course excellent to see how Boot Barn Holdings has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders.
