That act endorses the use of owner-operators in all 50 states to increase competition and to reduce the cost of trucking services.The goal of the 1994 statute was to provide a uniform law to eliminate a patchwork of state regulations that had made it difficult for the motor carrier industry to operate.Highberger also said the authorization act “demonstrates Congress’ intent to protect the owner-operator business model in the trucking industry and preclude its replacement by an 'employee-operator' regime.”The decision will be appealed by Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer, his office confirmed to FOX Business."As the Court itself stated, '... there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,'" Feuer said in a statement.CALIFORNIA GIG ECONOMY LAW TO STRIP TRUCK DRIVERS OF HIGHEST-PAYING INDUSTRY JOBSNEW JERSEY TRUCKERS ALARMED BY CALIFORNIA-LIKE GIG ECONOMY MEASUREAB-5 is intended to prevent workers from being wrongly classified as independent contractors, and deprived of basic labor protections as a result.Under the statute, in order for a company to treat a worker as a contractor, it must prove that the worker is independent and able to perform services free of company control, that the services the worker provides are not part of the company’s typical course of business and that the person separately works in the same type of business outside of the contracted work.The California Trucking Association filed a lawsuit to prevent the measure from being implemented earlier this month because the law would restrict the activities of independent owner-operators. The group alleged it would put 70,000 owner-operators out of work. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERESome companies even began taking preemptive measures to fend off fallout from the law. Landstar, the largest lease-contracting entity of owner-operators in the U.S., issued a note to hundreds of California operators cautioning them that they would need to make their own informed business decision with respect to how they want to react to the law.At the end of last month, in a separate case, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to stop the law from applying to the trucking industry.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSRelated ArticlesHow Much is Michael Phelps Worth?Ryan Lochte's Brand Value Sinks Amid Rio ScandalHere's How You Get a Body Like An OlympianReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKorea Cases Top 2,000; Nigeria Confirms Infection: Virus UpdateBloombergBradley's career night lifts Cal past No. 21 Colorado 76-62The Associated PressUS patient with coronavirus of unknown origin denied test for daysAFPCalifornia at heart of battle to choose Trump's opponentAFPBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
