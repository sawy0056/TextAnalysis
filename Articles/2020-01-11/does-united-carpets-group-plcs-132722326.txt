Check out our latest analysis for United Carpets Group How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for United Carpets Group:P/E of 11.46 = £0.06 ÷ £0.01 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each £1 the company has earned over the last year. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does United Carpets Group Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company.

Since the market seems unimpressed with United Carpets Group, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.United Carpets Group shrunk earnings per share by 45% over the last year. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 18% per year over the last five years. This could justify a pessimistic P/E.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankThe 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting United Carpets Group's P/E?United Carpets Group has net cash of UK£1.2m. This is fairly high at 24% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Verdict On United Carpets Group's P/E RatioUnited Carpets Group's P/E is 11.5 which is below average (18.4) in the GB market. The recent drop in earnings per share would make investors cautious, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: if so, the low P/E could be an opportunity.Story continuesInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
