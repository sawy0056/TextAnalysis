Son, who met the president for a second time in six months, said SoftBank wanted to support the building of a smart and green city loaded with artificial intelligence, although didn’t say how much his group would invest.Indonesia is set to begin construction of the new capital on Borneo island as Widodo seeks to ease pressure on the congested and sinking Jakarta, the current capital. Regular flooding in the Jakarta metropolitan area, home to almost 30 million people, and the need to spread economic growth beyond the main Java island have prompted Jokowi, as the president is known, to fast-track the capital relocation.The new city will be dotted with world-class educational institutions, modern hospitals, botanical gardens and backed by a environmentally-friendly transportation system with only electric vehicles, according to officials. Investors from China, the Middle East and the U.S. have shown interest in developing the city, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Pandjaitan has said.“We didn’t discuss specific numbers,” Son told reporters. The discussion with Jokowi centered around building a smart city using the newest technology that will be green and supported by lots of artificial intelligence, he said.SoftBank’s investment in the new capital will be in addition to the $2 billion the group has committed for the development of electric vehicles and renewable energy sectors in Indonesia, Son said.SoftBank’s Chief Seeks to Boost Investment in IndonesiaThe government has identified about 256,000 hectares of land on the island of Borneo for the yet-to-be-named capital -- about four times the size of Jakarta. Jokowi is counting on private and state-owned entities to bear about 80% of the cost of building the capital. Authorities plan to begin construction of the new city by the end of 2020 and relocate the capital in phases from 2024.To contact the reporters on this story: Arys Aditya in Jakarta at aaditya5@bloomberg.net;Harry Suhartono in Jakarta at hsuhartono@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Thomas Kutty Abraham at tabraham4@bloomberg.net, Karlis SalnaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCanada Stock Bourse Says Ready for Friday Open After Early CloseBloombergJPMorgan Joins Rush to Curb Global Travel as Virus SpreadsBloombergIndia Stocks Extend Slide, Heading for Worst Week in Four YearsBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergHere’s Where Investors Have Found Refuge in the Market StormBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
