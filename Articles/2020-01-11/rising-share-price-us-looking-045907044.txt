The bad news is that even after that recovery shareholders are still underwater by about 8.1% for the full year.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors' expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. View our latest analysis for Biosearch Does Biosearch Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?Biosearch's P/E is 35.80. As you can see below Biosearch has a P/E ratio that is fairly close for the average for the biotechs industry, which is 35.8.BME:BIO Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreThat indicates that the market expects Biosearch will perform roughly in line with other companies in its industry. If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosP/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.Biosearch shrunk earnings per share by 44% over the last year.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does Biosearch's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Biosearch has net debt worth just 6.0% of its market capitalization. It would probably trade on a higher P/E ratio if it had a lot of cash, but I doubt it is having a big impact.The Verdict On Biosearch's P/E RatioBiosearch trades on a P/E ratio of 35.8, which is above its market average of 16.9. With modest debt but no EPS growth in the last year, it's fair to say the P/E implies some optimism about future earnings, from the market. What is very clear is that the market has become significantly more optimistic about Biosearch over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 27.4 back then to 35.8 today.
