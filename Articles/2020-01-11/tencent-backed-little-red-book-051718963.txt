The company is working with an adviser on the financing plan and has sounded out potential investors, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. Its valuation reached about $5 billion last year, one person said.There hasn’t been a final decision on the fundraising size as deliberations are still at an early stage, the people said. A representative for Xiaohongshu didn’t respond to requests for comment.Xiaohongshu resumed seeking new funds following an earlier attempt that was suspended after its offering was taken down from app stores last year. The app has since returned and is available for downloads, with more than 300 million users as of July, according to its website.Xiaohongshu -- which calls itself RED and stresses its name bears no relation to the seminal book of Mao Zedong’s quotations -- was founded in 2013 as an online community that recommends overseas e-commerce sites for users in China. It later entered e-commerce and then evolved into a social media platform where users share their daily life moments through videos and pictures on topics including skincare, food and travel.The startup closed a $300 million series D financing at a valuation more than $3 billion in 2018. The round was led by Alibaba and other investors including GSR Ventures and Tencent Investment.--With assistance from Lulu Yilun Chen.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Dong Cao in Beijing at dcao59@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Fion Li at fli59@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCanada Stock Bourse Says Ready for Friday Open After Early CloseBloombergJPMorgan Joins Rush to Curb Global Travel as Virus SpreadsBloombergIndia Stocks Extend Slide, Heading for Worst Week in Four YearsBloombergOil’s Worst Week Since 2011 Puts Pressure on OPEC+ to RespondBloombergHere’s Where Investors Have Found Refuge in the Market StormBloombergBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
