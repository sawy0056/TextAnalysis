To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Ferronordic:0.35 = kr346m ÷ (kr2.3b - kr1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Ferronordic has an ROCE of 35%.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year.

The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Ferronordic has total liabilities of kr1.4b and total assets of kr2.3b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 58% of its total assets. While a high level of current liabilities boosts its ROCE, Ferronordic's returns are still very good.Our Take On Ferronordic's ROCEStory continuesSo to us, the company is potentially worth investigating further.
