Official statement: We would like to inform you of the upcoming changes in the Deribit structure.

This would mean that Deribit would likely have to provide significant personal data on its users.In an official statement on the company’s blog, Deribit BV said it would delegate its trading platform to its Panama-based daughter company DRB Panama Inc from February 10. The company stated: “We believe that crypto markets should be freely available to most, and the new regulations would put too high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise.” This means that the exchange will escape the upcoming requirements that force cryptocurrency exchanges in the EU to update their KYC policies or relocate – and which may even force some companies out of business.Implementing AMLD5 across the EU is not an easy featWhile the official deadline for the implementation of AMLD5 is today, there’s still a decent amount of uncertainty over how the regulations will be implemented in each separate EU member country.AML practices when it comes to cryptocurrency vary throughout Europe. For example, France has one approach, Germany has another, Malta has another still, and so on.The upcoming Brexit in the UK will also cause an additional layer of complexity when it comes to implementing data sharing requirements through the so-called ‘travel rule’.While it appears that the Netherlands will miss the official deadline, the country still pertains to the EU. This causes too much uncertainty for Deribit to continue operating there. Today is the 10th of January 2020, the day the AMLD5 should enter into force in EU Member States. Here in the Netherlands we're not there yet. This post provides a status update for NL.

It will require different levels of KYC based on customer activity.The future of exchanges in EuropeWhile Malta has managed to carve out a name for itself as a hub for key cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and OKEx, the fact remains that it pertains to the EU.It may take some time for the regulations to trickle down to member states. However, AMLD5 will certainly place a strain on cryptocurrency exchanges based in the EU.It remains to be seen whether other cryptocurrency exchanges will seek to achieve compliance or follow Deribit’s lead and relocate to friendlier shores.The post Deribit relocates to Panama ahead of tougher EU AML rules appeared first on Coin Rivet.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextCryptocurrency News: SEC Shuts Down Another Bitcoin ETFInvestopediaEther Futures Volume on FTX Hit Record HighsCoindeskDraper-Backed Exchange in Lockdown Following ‘Sophisticated’ AttackCoindeskSteven Seagal Isn’t Above the Securities LawThe Wall Street JournalIran commander touts crypto as solution to bypass sanctionsCoin RivetBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
