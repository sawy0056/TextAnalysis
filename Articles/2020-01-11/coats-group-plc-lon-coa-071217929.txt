In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Second, we'll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Then we'll determine how its current liabilities are affecting its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Coats Group:0.20 = US$191m ÷ (US$1.3b - US$378m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)So, Coats Group has an ROCE of 20%.

To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.Coats Group has total assets of US$1.3b and current liabilities of US$378m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 29% of its total assets. A minimal amount of current liabilities limits the impact on ROCE.What We Can Learn From Coats Group's ROCEWith low current liabilities and a high ROCE, Coats Group could be worthy of further investigation.
