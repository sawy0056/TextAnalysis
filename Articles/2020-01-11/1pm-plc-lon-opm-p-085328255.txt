We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to 1pm plc's (LON:OPM), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Looking at earnings over the last twelve months, 1pm has a P/E ratio of 5.14. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 19.5%. Check out our latest analysis for 1pm How Do I Calculate A Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for 1pm:P/E of 5.14 = £0.38 ÷ £0.07 (Based on the year to May 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does 1pm Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that 1pm has a lower P/E than the average (7.8) P/E for companies in the diversified financial industry.AIM:OPM Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that 1pm shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Since the market seems unimpressed with 1pm, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.1pm's earnings per share fell by 3.6% in the last twelve months. But EPS is up 16% over the last 5 years.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.1pm's Balance Sheet1pm has net debt worth just 5.7% of its market capitalization. It would probably trade on a higher P/E ratio if it had a lot of cash, but I doubt it is having a big impact.The Bottom Line On 1pm's P/E Ratio1pm has a P/E of 5.1. That's below the average in the GB market, which is 18.4. The debt levels are not a major concern, but the lack of EPS growth is likely weighing on sentiment.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.But note: 1pm may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20).Story continuesIf you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.
