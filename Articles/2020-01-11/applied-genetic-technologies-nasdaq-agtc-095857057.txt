But if you pick the right stock, you can make a lot more than 100%. For example, the Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:AGTC) share price has soared 190% in the last year. Most would be very happy with that, especially in just one year! Better yet, the 242% gain over the last thirty days has shareholders excited. Zooming out, the stock is actually down 1.4% in the last three years. Check out our latest analysis for Applied Genetic Technologies Applied Genetic Technologies wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.In the last year Applied Genetic Technologies saw its revenue shrink by 0.9%. So we would not have expected the share price to rise 190%. This is a good example of how buyers can push up prices even before the fundamental metrics show much growth. It's quite likely the revenue fall was already priced in, anyway.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).NasdaqGM:AGTC Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on Applied Genetic Technologies's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Applied Genetic Technologies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 190% over the last year.
