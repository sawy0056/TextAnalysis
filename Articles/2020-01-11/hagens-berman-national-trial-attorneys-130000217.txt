According to the same article, ComEd's lobbying investigation dated back to at least mid-May 2019, when the FBI executed search warrants at the homes of former lobbyist Mike McClain of Quincy, a longtime confidant of House Speaker Michael Madigan, and of former 23rd Ward Ald. Michael Zalewski. Additionally, the FBI sought communications among Madigan, McClain and Zalewski about attempts to obtain ComEd lobbying work for Zalewski.If you invested in Exelon between Feb. 9, 2019 and Nov. 1, 2019 (the "Class Period") and suffered significant losses, you may qualify to be a lead plaintiff - one who selects and oversees the attorneys prosecuting the case.
