Skadden has reportedly been able to review only 76 entities since September and requires more time to cover all.Last week, the SEC had urged a court to compel Telegram to provide full bank records tied to the company’s token sales worth $1.7 billion. Telegram then refused to share the records. Later, the court denied without prejudice the SEC’s request to get complete bank records, and ordered Telegram to provide “a proposed schedule for a review of the requested bank records to ensure that production of such records complies with foreign data privacy laws.”Telegram had time until Jan. 9 to submit the proposed schedule. Skadden has responded to this schedule, saying it needs more time. The SEC sued Telegram last October for allegedly “illegal offering of digital-asset securities called Grams.” The case has been ongoing since then. Telegram, on its part, has refuted all the allegations made by the SEC. The company recently claimed that "if and when" Gram tokens launch, "they will constitute a currency and/or commodity – not securities under the federal securities laws.”ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSEC orders Wells Fargo pay $35 million for recommendations of high-risk productsReutersDoorDash quietly files paperwork to go publicMarketWatchSteven Seagal to Pay SEC $314,000 for Failing to Disclose Payments Earned for Promotional WorkPeopleActor Steven Seagal settles ‘Bitcoiin’ ICO endorsement disclosure charges with SECThe BlockSteven Seagal Settles Token-Touting Charges With SEC Over 2018 ICOCoindeskBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
