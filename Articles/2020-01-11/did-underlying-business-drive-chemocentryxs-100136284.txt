While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. Just think about the savvy investors who held ChemoCentryx, Inc.

Also pleasing for shareholders was the 407% gain in the last three months. View our latest analysis for ChemoCentryx Because ChemoCentryx made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.For the last half decade, ChemoCentryx can boast revenue growth at a rate of 34% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Arguably, this is well and truly reflected in the strong share price gain of 39%(per year) over the same period. It's never too late to start following a top notch stock like ChemoCentryx, since some long term winners go on winning for decades.
