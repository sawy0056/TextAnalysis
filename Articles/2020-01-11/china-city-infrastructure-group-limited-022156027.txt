Check out our latest analysis for China City Infrastructure Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At China City Infrastructure GroupIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman Chao Bo Li bought HK$30m worth of shares at a price of HK$0.50 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than HK$0.15 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important.
