Microsoft separately employs 2,000 people elsewhere in Dublin.Ireland is the European hub for a number of major technology firms. Facebook signed the largest ever office lease in Dublin in 2018 with plans for a new 57,000 square meter campus while Google bought a 37,000 square meter development earlier that year, to add to its other offices in the city.The expansions by some of the world's biggest companies come as new global rules are considered on how and where big internet firms pay tax that could test multinationals' commitment to Ireland where they pay a low 12.5% corporate tax rate.The Irish state agency competing to win foreign business said this week that there was no indication that companies were thinking differently about Ireland based on what tax reforms may emerge.IDA Ireland reported that employment by multinationals rose 6% year-on-year in 2019, almost three-times the rate across Ireland's fast-growing economy. Foreign companies now employ almost 250,000 people or just over one in 10 Irish workers.(Reporting by Padraic Halpin;Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSomething To Consider Before Buying China Electronics Huada Technology Company Limited (HKG:85) For The 2.7% DividendSimply Wall St.Two-time spaceflier Charles Simonyi offers advice for commercial space travelersGeekWireDublin darting drama as Michael Smith produces perfect legPA Media: SportValley tech companies see limited coronavirus impact; analyst warns it could be comingAmerican City Business Journals4 Giants See Stocks Plummet on Coronavirus WarningsGuruFocus.comBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
