We note that Guangdong Kanghua Healthcare Co., Ltd. (HKG:3689) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders.
