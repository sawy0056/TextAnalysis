Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for World-Link Logistics (Asia) Holding:0.12 = HK$16m ÷ (HK$172m - HK$43m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Therefore, World-Link Logistics (Asia) Holding has an ROCE of 12%.

The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.World-Link Logistics (Asia) Holding has total liabilities of HK$43m and total assets of HK$172m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 25% of its total assets.
