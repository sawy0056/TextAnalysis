Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.So, How Do We Calculate ROCE?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Amadeus IT Group:0.19 = €1.5b ÷ (€10b - €2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Amadeus IT Group has an ROCE of 19%.

Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Amadeus IT Group has total liabilities of €2.5b and total assets of €10b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 23% of its total assets. The fairly low level of current liabilities won't have much impact on the already great ROCE.Our Take On Amadeus IT Group's ROCE, There might be better investments than Amadeus IT Group out there,
