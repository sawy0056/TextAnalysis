The government is expected to announce consumer tax concessions and increase infrastructure spending.Given the slowing growth climate, investors have bet on large and mid-sized companies in the past year, pushing their stocks up.Median profit at companies on the Nifty 50 - the country's main stock index - is expected to have risen 10.7% in the December quarter. In the year ago period, the growth rate was 11.8%.Last year, the Nifty gained about 12%, while the Nifty Mid-cap 100 and Nifty Small-cap 100 dropped 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively.Changes in India's largest companies market cap in last 10 years https://tmsnrt.rs/2QWUz5zInfosys, is expected to record a 16.6% rise in profit when it reports results Friday afternoon for a quarter plagued by whistleblower complaints about its accounting practices.This compares with a 29.6% slump in earnings in the year-earlier period when marketing and hiring costs had surged.In contrast, bigger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which is more exposed to slowing sectors like retail and has taken a hit from Brexit, is expected to report a slim 0.8% rise in profit. This will be its lowest in two years and down from a 24% jump in the year-ago period.Indian companies' total returns for the last decade by sectors https://tmsnrt.rs/2T6Y4Jq(Reporting by Gaurav Dogra; Additional reporting by Nivedita Bhattacharya; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDell Projects Profit That Falls Short of Estimates on PC WarningBloombergBaidu’s Profit and Revenue RiseThe Wall Street JournalFinancial firms discussing coronavirus contingency plans with regulators - officialReutersFinancial firms discussing coronavirus contingency plans with regulators: officialReutersIs the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau constitutional?
