Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Allied Group Limited (HKG:373).Do Insider Transactions Matter?It is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, rules govern insider transactions, and certain disclosures are required.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'. See our latest analysis for Allied Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Allied GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Sok Un Chong for HK$289m worth of shares, at about HK$38.50 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of HK$39.00. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. The good news for Allied Group share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price.
