(CVE:DEX) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 13% in the last month. But that is minimal compensation for the share price under-performance over the last year. The cold reality is that the stock has dropped 18% in one year, under-performing the market. Check out our latest analysis for Almadex Minerals We don't think Almadex Minerals's revenue of CA$328,119 is enough to establish significant demand. We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. It seems likely some shareholders believe that Almadex Minerals will find or develop a valuable new mine before too long.We think companies that have neither significant revenues nor profits are pretty high risk. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some such companies do very well over the long term, others become hyped up by promoters before eventually falling back down to earth, and going bankrupt (or being recapitalized).Almadex Minerals has plenty of cash in the bank, with cash in excess of all liabilities sitting at CA$6.2m, when it last reported (September 2019). This gives management the flexibility to drive business growth, without worrying too much about cash reserves. But with the share price diving 18% in the last year , it could be that the price was previously too hyped up.

While the aim is to do better than that, it's worth recalling that even great long-term investments sometimes underperform for a year or more. The share price decline has continued throughout the most recent three months, down 11%, suggesting an absence of enthusiasm from investors. Basically, most investors should be wary of buying into a poor-performing stock, unless the business itself has clearly improved.
