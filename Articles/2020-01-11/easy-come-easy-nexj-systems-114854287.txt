But really big losses can really drag down an overall portfolio. So consider, for a moment, the misfortune of NexJ Systems Inc. (TSE:NXJ) investors who have held the stock for three years as it declined a whopping 75%. That might cause some serious doubts about the merits of the initial decision to buy the stock, to put it mildly. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 46% lower in that time. Unhappily, the share price slid 5.6% in the last week. Check out our latest analysis for NexJ Systems NexJ Systems wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.In the last three years NexJ Systems saw its revenue shrink by 21% per year. That means its revenue trend is very weak compared to other loss making companies. The swift share price decline at an annual compound rate of 37%, reflects this weak fundamental performance. We prefer leave it to clowns to try to catch falling knives, like this stock. It's worth remembering that investors call buying a steeply falling share price 'catching a falling knife' because it is a dangerous pass time.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).TSX:NXJ Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreThis free interactive report on NexJ Systems's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveNexJ Systems shareholders are down 46% for the year, but the market itself is up 14%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8.3% over the last half decade.
