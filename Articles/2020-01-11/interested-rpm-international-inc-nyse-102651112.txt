(NYSE:RPM)’s Upcoming 0.5% Dividend? You Have 4 Days LeftSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosRPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days time. This means that investors who purchase shares on or after the 15th of January will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of January.RPM International's next dividend payment will be US$0.36 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.44 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, RPM International has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current stock price of $73.65. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for RPM International If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. RPM International paid out more than half (55%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 63% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that RPM International's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.NYSE:RPM Historical Dividend Yield, January 10th 2020MoreHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see RPM International earnings per share are up 3.0% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last ten years, RPM International has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.1% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayShould investors buy RPM International for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy RPM International today.Ever wonder what the future holds for RPM International?
