Return On Capital Employed Looks UninspiringSimply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosToday we are going to look at BP p.l.c. (LON:BP.) to see whether it might be an attractive investment prospect. In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business.Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. All else being equal, a better business will have a higher ROCE. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for BP:0.065 = US$14b ÷ (US$286b - US$65b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, BP has an ROCE of 6.5%. See our latest analysis for BP Is BP's ROCE Good?ROCE is commonly used for comparing the performance of similar businesses. We can see BP's ROCE is meaningfully below the Oil and Gas industry average of 10%. This performance is not ideal, as it suggests the company may not be deploying its capital as effectively as some competitors. Aside from the industry comparison, BP's ROCE is mediocre in absolute terms, considering the risk of investing in stocks versus the safety of a bank account. Investors may wish to consider higher-performing investments.BP delivered an ROCE of 6.5%, which is better than 3 years ago, as was making losses back then. That implies the business has been improving. You can see in the image below how BP's ROCE compares to its industry. Click to see more on past growth.LSE:BP. Past Revenue and Net Income, January 10th 2020MoreWhen considering ROCE, bear in mind that it reflects the past and does not necessarily predict the future. ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. Given the industry it operates in, BP could be considered cyclical. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for BP.What Are Current Liabilities, And How Do They Affect BP's ROCE?Short term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.BP has total assets of US$286b and current liabilities of US$65b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 23% of its total assets. It is good to see a restrained amount of current liabilities, as this limits the effect on ROCE.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On BP's ROCEThat said, BP's ROCE is mediocre, there may be more attractive investments around.
