But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the Europris ASA (OB:EPR) share price is 35% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 4.2% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! Zooming out, the stock is actually down 14% in the last three years. Check out our latest analysis for Europris To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the last year, Europris actually saw its earnings per share drop 1.7%.The mild decline in EPS may be a result of the fact that the company is more focused on other aspects of the business, right now. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We haven't seen Europris increase dividend payments yet, so the yield probably hasn't helped drive the share higher. Rather, we'd posit that the revenue increase of 10% might be more meaningful. After all, it's not necessarily a bad thing if a business sacrifices profits today in pursuit of profit tomorrow (metaphorically speaking).You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).OB:EPR Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreTake a more thorough look at Europris's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Europris's TSR for the last year was 45%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Europris shareholders have gained 45% (in total) over the last year. That's including the dividend. So this year's TSR was actually better than the three-year TSR (annualized) of 1.3%. The improving returns to shareholders suggests the stock is becoming more popular with time.
