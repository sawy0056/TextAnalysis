By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Kering SA (EPA:KER).Our data shows Kering has a return on equity of 22% for the last year. One way to conceptualize this, is that for each €1 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made €0.22 in profit. See our latest analysis for Kering How Do You Calculate ROE?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Kering:22% = €2.1b ÷ €9.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)It's easy to understand the 'net profit' part of that equation, but 'shareholders' equity' requires further explanation. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. Shareholders' equity can be calculated by subtracting the total liabilities of the company from the total assets of the company.What Does Return On Equity Mean?Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the yearly profit. The higher the ROE, the more profit the company is making. So, all else equal, investors should like a high ROE. That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses.Does Kering Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Kering has a superior ROE than the average (14%) company in the Luxury industry.ENXTPA:KER Past Revenue and Net Income, January 10th 2020MoreThat is a good sign. In my book, a high ROE almost always warrants a closer look. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining Kering's Debt And Its 22% Return On EquityWhile Kering does have some debt, with debt to equity of just 0.49, we wouldn't say debt is excessive. When I see a high ROE, fuelled by only modest debt, I suspect the business is high quality. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.The Key TakeawayReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.
