In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.How Does OC Oerlikon's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?With net cash of CHF601m, OC Oerlikon has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business.
