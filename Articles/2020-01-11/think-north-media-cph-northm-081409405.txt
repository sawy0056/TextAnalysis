When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies North Media A/S (CPH:NORTHM) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.
