We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to HKR International Limited's (HKG:480), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. HKR International has a price to earnings ratio of 2.26, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 44.3%. See our latest analysis for HKR International How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for HKR International:P/E of 2.26 = HK$3.23 ÷ HK$1.43 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.Does HKR International Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see HKR International has a lower P/E than the average (7.0) in the real estate industry classification.SEHK:480 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreThis suggests that market participants think HKR International will underperform other companies in its industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with HKR International, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.HKR International shrunk earnings per share by 17% over the last year. But EPS is up 9.9% over the last 5 years.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Is Debt Impacting HKR International's P/E?HKR International's net debt is 94% of its market cap. This is a reasonably significant level of debt -- all else being equal you'd expect a much lower P/E than if it had net cash.The Bottom Line On HKR International's P/E RatioHKR International has a P/E of 2.3. That's below the average in the HK market, which is 10.6. The P/E reflects market pessimism that probably arises from the lack of recent EPS growth, paired with significant leverage.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. We don't have analyst forecasts, but shareholders might want to examine this detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesYou might be able to find a better buy than HKR International.
