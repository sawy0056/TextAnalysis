(HKG:1697) At This P/E Ratio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosThis article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll look at Shandong International Trust Co., Ltd.'s (HKG:1697) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. What is Shandong International Trust's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 4.68. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 21.4%. See our latest analysis for Shandong International Trust How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price (in reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Shandong International Trust:P/E of 4.68 = HK$0.78 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, CNY ) ÷ HK$0.17 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.How Does Shandong International Trust's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Shandong International Trust has a lower P/E than the average (14.1) P/E for companies in the capital markets industry.SEHK:1697 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Shandong International Trust shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Since the market seems unimpressed with Shandong International Trust, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Shandong International Trust saw earnings per share decrease by 10% last year. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 7.6% per year over the last five years. This growth rate might warrant a below average P/E ratio.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does Shandong International Trust's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Shandong International Trust has net cash of CN¥1.6b. This is fairly high at 44% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Verdict On Shandong International Trust's P/E RatioShandong International Trust trades on a P/E ratio of 4.7, which is below the HK market average of 10.5. The recent drop in earnings per share would almost certainly temper expectations, the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If that occurs, the current low P/E could prove to be temporary.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
