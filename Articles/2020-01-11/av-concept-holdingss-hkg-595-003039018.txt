However, the annual gain of 7.4% wasn't so impressive.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. Check out our latest analysis for AV Concept Holdings How Does AV Concept Holdings's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?We can tell from its P/E ratio of 6.79 that sentiment around AV Concept Holdings isn't particularly high. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (9.7) for companies in the electronic industry is higher than AV Concept Holdings's P/E.SEHK:595 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that AV Concept Holdings shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosCompanies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.AV Concept Holdings saw earnings per share decrease by 69% last year. And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 6.7% per year over the last five years. This might lead to muted expectations.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetOne drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.How Does AV Concept Holdings's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?With net cash of HK$127m, AV Concept Holdings has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 45% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On AV Concept Holdings's P/E RatioAV Concept Holdings trades on a P/E ratio of 6.8, which is below the HK market average of 10.5. The recent drop in earnings per share would almost certainly temper expectations, the relatively strong balance sheet will allow the company time to invest in growth. If it achieves that, then there's real potential that the low P/E could eventually indicate undervaluation. What is very clear is that the market has become less pessimistic about AV Concept Holdings over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 4.9 back then to 6.8 today. If you like to buy stocks that could be turnaround opportunities, then this one might be a candidate; but if you're more sensitive to price, then you may feel the opportunity has passed.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. Although we don't have analyst forecasts shareholders might want to examine this detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.
