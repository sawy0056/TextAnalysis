(BNGO), a life sciences instrumentation company that develops and markets Saphyr®, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection in genome analysis, today announced multiple oral and poster presentations at the upcoming International Plant & Animal Genome (PAG) XXVIII Conference, to be held January 11 – 15, 2020 in San Diego, California. A total of 21 posters and 13 oral presentations will discuss genome assemblies and workflows that include Bionano genome imaging data to build the most complete and accurate genome assemblies and to analyze variations of genome structure.Data from the Saphyr system can be used to identify structural variation between cultivars, breeds or species, and to build platinum quality genomes by scaffolding sequence contigs. While other scaffolding technologies improve the contiguity of sequence assemblies by adding additional layers of more complex sequence data, Bionano’s de novo assembled genome maps build a completely sequence-independent, up to chromosome-arm length genome assembly. Because Bionano’s assemblies are built de novo, without sequence or reference guidance, they are independent of the common sequence biases and therefore can uniquely validate sequence assemblies and correct assembly errors, while generating genomes of the highest quality and contiguity.Erik Holmlin, Ph.D., CEO of Bionano, commented, “With record participation this year at PAG XXVIII, scientists are showing how data from the Saphyr system drives the assembly of reference-quality genomes and enables the sensitive detection of structural variations. Scientists from Bionano are further presenting improvements to almost every step of our workflow including sample prep, data analysis and visualization, making it easier and faster to get a comprehensive view of structure and structural variants, even in large complex genomes common with plants and animals. It is increasingly clear that genome imaging data are essential for having the most contiguous and accurate genome assemblies.”Bionano will be hosting a workshop entitled, “Generating Accurate De Novo Assemblies with Bionano Optical Mapping,” led by prominent genomics researchers, Dr. Michael Hiller from Max Planck Institute, Dr. Victor Llaca from Corteva Agriscience and Geoff Waldbieser from USDA.  Examples will be presented on how the Bionano Saphyr platform is helping to build the most complete and accurate genome assemblies. Bionano will be onsite at Booth #325 to discuss the Saphyr system and answer questions regarding genome imaging and the summarized findings presented during the various sessions.Multiple scientists from around the world are scheduled to present Bionano data, including in the workshop, oral and poster presentations below:Bionano Workshop: Generating Accurate De Novo Assemblies with Bionano Optical Mapping Presenting Authors: Chad Collier, Dr. Michael Hiller, Dr. Victor Llaca, Geoff WaldbieserDate, Time: Monday, January 13, 4:00 pm – 6:10 pmLocation: Room East 2Oral Presentations:A Long Reads-Based De-Novo Assembly of the Rainbow Trout Arlee-Line GenomeGao et al., Saturday, Jan 11, 8:20am, Royal Palm Salon 3-2             New Genomic Resource in Watercress (Nasturtium officinale, R.)
