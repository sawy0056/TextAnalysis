But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Norish Plc (LON:NSH) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 129% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 19% gain in the last three months. View our latest analysis for Norish To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Norish's earnings per share are down 3.5% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.The modest 1.9% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. On the other hand, Norish's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 12% over the last five years. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).AIM:NSH Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreWe know that Norish has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store? You can see what analysts are predicting for Norish in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Norish the TSR over the last 5 years was 159%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Norish shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 21% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.
