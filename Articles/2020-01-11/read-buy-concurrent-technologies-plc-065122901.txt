We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Concurrent Technologies Plc's (LON:CNC), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Based on the last twelve months, Concurrent Technologies's P/E ratio is 13.67. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 7.3%. Check out our latest analysis for Concurrent Technologies How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Concurrent Technologies:P/E of 13.67 = £0.81 ÷ £0.06 (Based on the year to June 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does Concurrent Technologies Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (23.7) for companies in the tech industry is higher than Concurrent Technologies's P/E.AIM:CNC Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreConcurrent Technologies's P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with Concurrent Technologies, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.In the last year, Concurrent Technologies grew EPS like Taylor Swift grew her fan base back in 2010; the 71% gain was both fast and well deserved. The sweetener is that the annual five year growth rate of 45% is also impressive. With that kind of growth rate we would generally expect a high P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.So What Does Concurrent Technologies's Balance Sheet Tell Us?With net cash of UK£10m, Concurrent Technologies has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 17% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Verdict On Concurrent Technologies's P/E RatioConcurrent Technologies has a P/E of 13.7. That's below the average in the GB market, which is 18.4. The net cash position gives plenty of options to the business, and the recent improvement in EPS is good to see. One might conclude that the market is a bit pessimistic, given the low P/E ratio.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
