But really big losses can really drag down an overall portfolio. So consider, for a moment, the misfortune of Yi Hua Holdings Limited (HKG:2213) investors who have held the stock for three years as it declined a whopping 88%. That would certainly shake our confidence in the decision to own the stock. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 73% in the last year. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 23% in the last three months.While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness. See our latest analysis for Yi Hua Holdings Yi Hua Holdings isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.Over three years, Yi Hua Holdings grew revenue at 5.6% per year. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. But the share price crash at 51% per year does seem a bit harsh! While we're definitely wary of the stock, after that kind of performance, it could be an over-reaction. Of course, revenue growth is nice but generally speaking the lower the profits, the riskier the business - and this business isn't making steady profits.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:2213 Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Yi Hua Holdings's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We've already covered Yi Hua Holdings's share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Yi Hua Holdings shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 88%, over the last 3 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 9.1% in the last year, Yi Hua Holdings shareholders lost 73%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 23% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.
