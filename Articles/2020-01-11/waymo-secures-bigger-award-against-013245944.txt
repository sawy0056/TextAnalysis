Last year, Uber said it could have to pay the entire judgment as part of indemnification pacts with the two workers.The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Google, which spun off Waymo in 2016, alleged that year that engineer Anthony Levandowski and business leader Lior Ron breached various contracts as they brought Waymo employees and technology to Uber.Waymo won an interim judgment last March, with Levandowski liable for $127 million, while he and Ron were together on the hook for a further $1 million, according to previous disclosures.The company last month was then awarded the legal fees, attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest, but the amounts were redacted in state court papers filed on Thursday in San Francisco.Waymo said it was seeking court approval to publish the figures.Ron remains at Uber. The company fired Levandowski in 2017 and said last year it would pursue reimbursement from him. Attorneys for Levandowski did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Waymo settled a related lawsuit against Uber by securing a 0.34% stake in the company and an agreement that Uber would stop freely using Waymo technology.Levandowski is separately fighting a federal indictment on charges of stealing trade secrets from Google's self-driving car efforts.(Reporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMore companies logging more autonomous miles in CaliforniaAmerican City Business JournalsFacebook cancels developer conference as tech companies respond to virusReutersAshley Graham Pumped in an Uber & Lived to Tell the TalePureWowDoorDash Files Paperwork for Initial Public OfferingBloombergDoorDash files to go public in latest IPO test for unprofitable startupsReutersBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
