Players have to mine from a vast underground space and craft their base structure with the raw materials unearthed andbuild original barricades to drive away the enemies.A major selling point of this game is its solid worldview, which includes groups of collapsed buildings, giant creatures squirming in the distance, numerous enemies, and underground ruins.Huge waves of zombies are approachingAs time passes and night draws in, huge numbers of zombies will rush toward the "cradle". The number and types of enemies that appear increase by day. Players have to strategize the most effective way to deal with each type of enemy.Mining in a vast underground spaceThere are plenty of resources underground, where the player can mine for raw materials to craft their base structure. Player will unearth new raw materials, and even the remains of a past civilization as they dig deeper.Think outside of the boxPlayer can craft a base structure to protect against zombie attacks above ground.
