For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?So, the natural question for BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. Let's start with an examination of the business's cash, relative to its cash burn. See our latest analysis for BioNTech When Might BioNTech Run Out Of Money?A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. BioNTech has such a small amount of debt that we'll set it aside, and focus on the €464m in cash it held at September 2019. Importantly, its cash burn was €220m over the trailing twelve months. Therefore, from September 2019 it had 2.1 years of cash runway. Arguably, that's a prudent and sensible length of runway to have. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.NasdaqGS:BNTX Historical Debt, January 10th 2020MoreHow Well Is BioNTech Growing?BioNTech boosted investment sharply in the last year, with cash burn ramping by 81%. That does give us pause, and we can't take much solace in the operating revenue growth of 13% in the same time frame. In light of the data above, we're fairly sanguine about the business growth trajectory. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at our analyst forecasts for the company.How Easily Can BioNTech Raise Cash?While BioNTech seems to be in a fairly good position, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.BioNTech has a market capitalisation of €9.2b and burnt through €220m last year, which is 2.4% of the company's market value. That means it could easily issue a few shares to fund more growth, and might well be in a position to borrow cheaply.So, Should We Worry About BioNTech's Cash Burn?On this analysis of BioNTech's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its increasing cash burn has us a bit worried. Based on the factors mentioned in this article, we think its cash burn situation warrants some attention from shareholders, but we don't think they should be worried. While we always like to monitor cash burn for early stage companies, qualitative factors such as the CEO pay can also shed light on the situation.
