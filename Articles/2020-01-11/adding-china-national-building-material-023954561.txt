View our latest analysis for China National Building Material China National Building Material's Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, China National Building Material has grown earnings per share (EPS) like young bamboo after rain; fast, and from a low base.

For companies with market capitalizations between CN¥28b and CN¥83b, like China National Building Material, the median CEO pay is around CN¥3.9m.The China National Building Material CEO received total compensation of just CN¥1.8m in the year to December 2018. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance, that arrangement seems generous to shareholders, and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Does China National Building Material Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?For growth investors like me, China National Building Material's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night.
