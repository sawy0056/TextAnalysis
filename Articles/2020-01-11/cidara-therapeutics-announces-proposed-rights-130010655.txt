Under the terms of the rights offering, investors as of January 21, 2020 in Cidara’s common stock and preferred stock, as well as the holders of Cidara’s warrants issued on May 21, 2018, will receive a subscription right entitling them to purchase their pro rata share of the $30.0 million offering amount. The rights offering will be fully backstopped by BVF Partners L.P. and Stonepine Capital, LP, each of which have agreed to purchase, at a minimum, its respective as-converted pro rata share of the offering amount, plus an additional amount of securities that are not subscribed for by other purchasers in the rights offering, for a total of up to $30.0 million.Under the proposed rights offering (the “Rights Offering”), Cidara plans to distribute non-transferable subscription rights to purchase a portion of a share of Cidara’s common stock (“Common Stock”) for each outstanding share of Common Stock, Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding shares of Cidara’s Series X convertible preferred stock (“Series X Preferred”), and Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Common Stock Purchase Warrants issued by Cidara on May 21, 2018 (“Warrants”), at $2.51 per share, which is a 15% discount to the 30-day volume weighted average price of Cidara’s common stock, to such security holders of record as of the close of business on January 21, 2020 (the “Record Date”). The subscription rights will be exercisable for an aggregate of up to 11,952,191 shares of Common Stock and up to 1,195,219 shares of Series X Preferred, with participation to be allocated among holders of its Common Stock, Series X Preferred and Warrants on a pro rata basis (assuming full conversion of the Series X Preferred into shares of Common Stock and the full exercise of the Warrants into shares of Common Stock), subject to the aggregate offering threshold and ownership limitations.

Any participant in the Rights Offering that, by exercise of its subscription right would become a holder of greater than 9.99% of the outstanding number of shares of Common Stock following the Rights Offering may elect to instead purchase Series X Preferred. Cidara intends to sell the Series X Preferred at $25.10 per share, and any such holder so electing would have a right to purchase one one-tenth of a share of Series X Preferred for each share of Common Stock it had a right to purchase under the subscription rights.
