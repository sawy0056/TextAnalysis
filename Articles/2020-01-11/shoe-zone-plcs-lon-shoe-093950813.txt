We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Shoe Zone plc's (LON:SHOE), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. What is Shoe Zone's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 14.22. That means that at current prices, buyers pay £14.22 for every £1 in trailing yearly profits. See our latest analysis for Shoe Zone How Do You Calculate A P/E Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Shoe Zone:P/E of 14.22 = £1.63 ÷ £0.11 (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each £1 of company earnings. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Shoe Zone Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that Shoe Zone has a lower P/E than the average (16.0) P/E for companies in the specialty retail industry.AIM:SHOE Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Shoe Zone shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Shoe Zone shrunk earnings per share by 40% over the last year. And over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have decreased 6.6% annually. This could justify a pessimistic P/E.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.Shoe Zone's Balance SheetShoe Zone has net cash of UK£11m. This is fairly high at 14% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Bottom Line On Shoe Zone's P/E RatioShoe Zone's P/E is 14.2 which is below average (18.4) in the GB market. Falling earnings per share are likely to be keeping potential buyers away, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: if so, the low P/E could be an opportunity.Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.
