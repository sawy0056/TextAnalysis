To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for Magellan Aerospace:0.11 = CA$106m ÷ (CA$1.1b - CA$198m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Therefore, Magellan Aerospace has an ROCE of 11%.

Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.Magellan Aerospace has total assets of CA$1.1b and current liabilities of CA$198m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 18% of its total assets. Low current liabilities are not boosting the ROCE too much.Our Take On Magellan Aerospace's ROCEThis is good to see, and with a sound ROCE, Magellan Aerospace could be worth a closer look.
