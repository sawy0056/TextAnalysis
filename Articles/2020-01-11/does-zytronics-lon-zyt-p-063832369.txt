But shareholders may not all be feeling jubilant, since the share price is still down 30% in the last year.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. See our latest analysis for Zytronic How Does Zytronic's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?Zytronic's P/E of 14.61 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. The image below shows that Zytronic has a lower P/E than the average (21.5) P/E for companies in the electronic industry.AIM:ZYT Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Zytronic shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosWhen earnings fall, the 'E' decreases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is low, it will increase over time if the share price stays flat. A higher P/E should indicate the stock is expensive relative to others -- and that may encourage shareholders to sell.Zytronic saw earnings per share decrease by 26% last year. And over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have decreased 3.1% annually. This might lead to muted expectations.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.So What Does Zytronic's Balance Sheet Tell Us?Zytronic has net cash of UK£13m. This is fairly high at 33% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.The Bottom Line On Zytronic's P/E RatioZytronic's P/E is 14.6 which is below average (18.4) in the GB market. The recent drop in earnings per share would almost certainly temper expectations, but the net cash position means the company has time to improve: if so, the low P/E could be an opportunity. What we know for sure is that investors have become more excited about Zytronic recently, since they have pushed its P/E ratio from 10.7 to 14.6 over the last month. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But the contrarian may see it as a missed opportunity.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
