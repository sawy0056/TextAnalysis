With the recent approval for the expanded use of the UroLift System, Teleflex aims at fortifying its position in the Interventional Urology business on a global scale.The UroLift System, a minimally invasive in-office treatment, can be used for faster treatment and recovery from the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Teleflex’s UroLift System’s expanded use has also received a steady support from the medical fraternity.Significance of the ApprovalBPH or enlarged prostate is a non-cancerous enlargement of prostate in older men, affecting more than 40 million people in the United States alone.

The outcome of this data is similar to the L.I.F.T. randomized controlled trial, which showed that almost 70% of the patients with BPH belonged to the drug dropout category.
