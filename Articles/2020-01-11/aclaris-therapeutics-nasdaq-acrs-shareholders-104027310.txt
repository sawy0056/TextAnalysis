(NASDAQ:ACRS) is up 31% in the last quarter. But that is meagre solace in the face of the shocking decline over three years. To wit, the share price sky-dived 94% in that time. Arguably, the recent bounce is to be expected after such a bad drop. The thing to think about is whether the business has really turned around.While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness.
