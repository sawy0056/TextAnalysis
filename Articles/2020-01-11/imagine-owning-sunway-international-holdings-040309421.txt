We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. Spare a thought for those who held Sunway International Holdings Limited (HKG:58) for five whole years - as the share price tanked 96%. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 25% over the last twelve months. The good news is that the stock is up 65% in the last week.While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness. Check out our latest analysis for Sunway International Holdings Because Sunway International Holdings made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.In the last five years Sunway International Holdings saw its revenue shrink by 13% per year. That puts it in an unattractive cohort, to put it mildly. So it's not that strange that the share price dropped 46% per year in that period. This kind of price performance makes us very wary, especially when combined with falling revenue. Ironically, that behavior could create an opportunity for the contrarian investor - but only if there are good reasons to predict a brighter future.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).SEHK:58 Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months.
