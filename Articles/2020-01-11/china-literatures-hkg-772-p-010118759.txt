However, the annual gain of 7.4% wasn't so impressive.Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. Check out our latest analysis for China Literature How Does China Literature's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?China Literature's P/E of 42.99 indicates some degree of optimism towards the stock. As you can see below, China Literature has a higher P/E than the average company (26.9) in the media industry.SEHK:772 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreThat means that the market expects China Literature will outperform other companies in its industry. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So investors should always consider the P/E ratio alongside other factors, such as whether company directors have been buying shares.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.China Literature shrunk earnings per share by 19% over the last year.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won't reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.How Does China Literature's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?With net cash of CN¥4.8b, China Literature has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 14% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.The Bottom Line On China Literature's P/E RatioChina Literature's P/E is 43.0 which is way above average (10.5) in its market. Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away, but the relatively strong balance sheet will allow the company time to invest in growth. Clearly, the high P/E indicates shareholders think it will! What is very clear is that the market has become significantly more optimistic about China Literature over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 32.6 back then to 43.0 today. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might mean it's time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But the contrarian may see it as a missed opportunity.Story continuesWhen the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity.
