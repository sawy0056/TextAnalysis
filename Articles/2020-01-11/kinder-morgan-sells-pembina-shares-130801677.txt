KMI recently announced that it has sold all Pembina Pipeline Corporation PBA shares that were received by the company following the divestment of a stake in Kinder Morgan Canada Limited. For the sale of a 70% interest in the Canadian unit, Kinder Morgan got 25 million shares of Pembina.Divestment RationaleThe move of divesting its Canadian unit and the U.S. part of the Cochin Pipeline is in line with the midstream company’s strategy of reducing debt burden through divestments. Converting Pembina shares into cash of $764 million in after-tax proceeds will likely help Kinder Morgan to increase balance sheet flexibility.The latest move is significant for the company as it had only $241 million in cash and cash equivalents, and a long-term debt of $30,849 million at the end of third-quarter 2019. Total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 50.6%, signifying that its balance sheet is more levered than the industry it belongs to.Post-Divestment 2020 EstimatesThe company expects distributable cash flow of $5.1 billion in 2020, despite the divestment of assets to Pembina. Moreover, it anticipates $7.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA for this year. Also, in 2020, the company’s dividend payments are expected to rise 25% year over year to $1.25 per share.Price PerformanceHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Kinder Morgan has gained 24.1% in the past year compared with 2.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Kinder Morgan has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
