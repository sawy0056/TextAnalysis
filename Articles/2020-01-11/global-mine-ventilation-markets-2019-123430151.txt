However, depletion of natural resources and electrification of mine equipment and machinery is restraining the market growth. Equipment to lead overall mine ventilation market during forecast periodProductivity and safety are the main priorities of any mine operator. Equipment such as fans, air coolers, and heaters are contributing to the growth of the market. These equipment are used in mines for maintaining safe and comfortable working conditions for the miners.Underground mining market to grow at highest CAGR during forecast period An underground mining technique is used to extract the mineral and ore deposits, which are buried deep under the earth's crust. The primary objective of operating an underground mine is to extract the maximum amount of ore with a minimum tailing. However, underground mining is considered more dangerous than surface mining due to potential dangers such as the adverse health effects, collapse, and the release of toxic gases and the lack of proper ventilation, which results in suffocation. Thus, mine ventilation systems are required to provide a flow of air to the underground workings of a mine in sufficient volume to dilute and remove dust and noxious gases; and regulate temperature.Asia Pacific to be largest and fastest-growing mine ventilation market during forecast periodThe region has abundant natural reserves in the form of iron ore, copper, gold, silver, zinc, and magnesium. Australia, China, and India are the major countries wherein mining is done. The region has witnessed growth in mining operations due to increasing demand for raw materials from various manufacturing industries. With the growing mining operations, the mine operating companies have increased demand for mine ventilation systems in APAC.Key Topics Covered1 Introduction 2 Research Methodology 3 Executive Summary 4 Premium Insights4.1 Mine Ventilation Market, 2019-2024 (USD Million)4.2 Market, By Offering4.3 Mine Ventilation Equipment Market, By Type4.4 Market, By Technique and Region4.5 Market, By Geography5 Market Overview 5.1 Introduction5.2 Market Dynamics5.3 Drivers5.3.1.1 Requirement for Optimized and Quality Airflow in Mines5.3.1.2 Rise in Number of Infrastructure Development Projects5.4 Restraints5.4.1.1 Depletion of Natural Resources5.4.1.2 Electrification of Mine Equipment and Machinery5.5 Opportunities5.5.1.1 Rise in Number of Planned Mining Activities Worldwide5.7 Challenges5.7.1.1 Revised Trade Agreements and Continuous Changes in Environmental Regulations That Impact Mining Industry Globally5.7.1.2 High Operational Costs Mine Ventilation Systems5.8 Value Chain Analysis6 Mine Ventilation Market, By Equipment6.1 Introduction6.2 Equipment6.2.1 Safe and Comfortable Working Conditions for Miners Require Efficient Mine Ventilation Equipment6.2.2 Ventilation6.2.2.1 Ventilation Equipment to Grow at the Highest CAGR During Forecast Period6.2.2.2 Fans6.2.2.3 Compressors6.2.2.4 Blowers6.2.3 Cooling6.2.3.1 Air Coolers Market to Grow at Highest Rate Between 2019 and 20246.2.3.2 Air Coolers6.2.3.3 Refrigerating Units6.2.4 Heating6.2.4.1 Heater to Hold Largest Share of Heating Equipment Market6.2.4.2 Heaters6.2.4.3 Heat Exchangers6.3 Software6.3.1 Software Help to Accurately Model Ventilation System and Improve Safety and Efficiency of Mines6.4 Services6.4.1 Services to Grow at the Highest Rate During Forecast Period7 Mine Ventilation Market, By Technique7.1 Introduction7.2 Underground Mining7.2.1 Underground Mining Segment Projected to Lead Market From 2019 to 20247.3 Surface Mining7.3.1 Services Segment of Market for Surface Mining Projected to Grow at the Highest CAGR From 2019 to 20248 Geographic Analysis 8.1 Introduction8.2 North America8.2.1 US8.2.1.1 Increasing Mining Activities to Grow the Market in US8.2.2 Canada8.2.2.1 Increasing Mining Operations to Grow Demand for Mine Ventilation in Canada8.2.3 Mexico8.2.3.1 Rising Foreign Direct Investments in Mining Industry to Upsurge Demand for Mine Ventilation Systems in Mexico8.3 Europe8.3.1 Russia8.3.1.1 New Discoveries for Deposits of Gold to Boost the Mining Industry in Russia8.3.2 Germany8.3.2.1 New Partnerships in Mining Industry to Boost the Market8.3.3 Norway8.3.3.1 Upcoming Mining Activities to Boost the Market8.3.4 Rest of Europe8.3.4.1 Increased Mining Activities in the Region to Grow the Market for Mine Ventilation8.4 Asia Pacific8.4.1 China8.4.1.1 China to Be Leading Market in APAC Mine Ventilation Market8.4.2 Australia8.4.2.1 Upcoming Mining Activities to Boost the Market in Australia8.4.3 India8.4.3.1 Growing Mining Activities to Create Demand for Mine Ventilation in India8.4.4 Rest of APAC8.4.4.1 Growing Mining Industry in Indonesia to Drive the Market for Mine Ventilation8.5 RoW8.5.1 South America8.5.1.1 Increasing Mining Investments in South America to Grow Demand for Market8.5.2 Middle East8.5.2.1 Metal Production Projects to Drive the Market in Middle East8.5.3 Africa8.5.3.1 Mining Opportunities to Drive the Market for Mine Ventilation9 Competitive Landscape9.1 Overview9.2 Ranking of Players in Market9.3 Microquadrants Overview9.3.1 Visionaries9.3.2 Dynamic Differentiators9.3.3 Innovators9.3.4 Emerging Companies9.5 Competitive Situations & Trends9.5.1 Product Launches10 Company Profiles 10.1 Key Players10.1.1 ABB10.1.1.1 Business Overview10.1.1.2 Products Offered10.1.1.3 Recent Developments10.1.1.4 SWOT Analysis10.1.2 Epiroc10.1.3 Howden10.1.4 Stantec10.1.5 Twin City Fan10.1.6 ABC Industries10.1.7 Chicago Blowers10.1.8 DMT10.1.9 TLT Turbo10.1.10 New York Blower Company10.1.11 Zitron10.2 Right to Win10.3 Other Companies10.3.1 GEFA System10.3.2 Hurley Ventilation10.3.3 Sibenergomash10.3.4 BBE Consulting10.3.5 Schauenburg Industries10.3.6 Stiavelli10.3.7 ABC Ventilation Systems10.3.8 Clempcorp Australia10.3.9 Minetek10.3.10 Zibo FansStory continuesFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/3q4ecwResearch and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager press@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBiocontainment expert on coronavirus: There's no need for average people to panic yetYahoo FinanceA drug shortage due to the coronavirus is a 'considerable risk:' Fmr.
