To keep it practical, we'll show how CAR Inc.'s (HKG:699) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. What is CAR's P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 37.05. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 2.7%. Check out our latest analysis for CAR How Do I Calculate CAR's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share (in the reporting currency) ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for CAR:P/E of 37.05 = HK$4.62 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, CNY ) ÷ HK$0.12 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.Does CAR Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. As you can see below, CAR has a higher P/E than the average company (19.5) in the transportation industry.SEHK:699 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreCAR's P/E tells us that market participants think the company will perform better than its industry peers, going forward. Clearly the market expects growth, but it isn't guaranteed. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosIf earnings fall then in the future the 'E' will be lower. Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.CAR saw earnings per share decrease by 28% last year. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 11%. And over the longer term (3 years) earnings per share have decreased 45% annually. This growth rate might warrant a low P/E ratio.A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The BankIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.CAR's Balance SheetCAR's net debt is 94% of its market cap. This is enough debt that you'd have to make some adjustments before using the P/E ratio to compare it to a company with net cash.The Verdict On CAR's P/E RatioCAR's P/E is 37.0 which is way above average (10.6) in its market. With meaningful debt and a lack of recent earnings growth, the market has high expectations that the business will earn more in the future.When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.
