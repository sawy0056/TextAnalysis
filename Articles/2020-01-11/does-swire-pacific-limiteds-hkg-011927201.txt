We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Swire Pacific Limited's (HKG:19), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Swire Pacific has a P/E ratio of 6.01, based on the last twelve months. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying HK$6.01 for every HK$1 in prior year profit. Check out our latest analysis for Swire Pacific How Do I Calculate Swire Pacific's Price To Earnings Ratio?The formula for price to earnings
is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Swire Pacific:P/E of 6.01 = HK$72.35 ÷ HK$12.03 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)Is A High P/E Ratio Good?A higher P/E ratio means that buyers have to pay a higher price for each HK$1 the company has earned over the last year. That isn't necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.Does Swire Pacific Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio. If you look at the image below, you can see Swire Pacific has a lower P/E than the average (6.9) in the real estate industry classification.SEHK:19 Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 10th 2020MoreIts relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Swire Pacific shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Since the market seems unimpressed with Swire Pacific, it's quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.Swire Pacific's earnings per share fell by 34% in the last twelve months. But EPS is up 6.6% over the last 5 years.Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank DepositsIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.How Does Swire Pacific's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?Swire Pacific has net debt equal to 50% of its market cap. You'd want to be aware of this fact, but it doesn't bother us.The Verdict On Swire Pacific's P/E RatioSwire Pacific's P/E is 6.0 which is below average (10.5) in the HK market. With only modest debt, it's likely the lack of EPS growth at least partially explains the pessimism implied by the P/E ratio.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this.
