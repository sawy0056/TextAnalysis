While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Unfortunately the Vapotherm, Inc. (NYSE:VAPO) share price slid 39% over twelve months. That's well bellow the market return of 27%. Vapotherm may have better days ahead, of course; we've only looked at a one year period. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 9.3% in a month. View our latest analysis for Vapotherm Vapotherm isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.In the last year Vapotherm saw its revenue grow by 14%. While that may seem decent it isn't great considering the company is still making a loss. Given this fairly low revenue growth (and lack of profits), it's not particularly surprising to see the stock down 39% in a year. In a hot market it's easy to forget growth is the life-blood of a loss making company. But if you buy a loss making company then you could become a loss making investor.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).NYSE:VAPO Income Statement, January 10th 2020MoreIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsA Different PerspectiveWhile Vapotherm shareholders are down 39% for the year, the market itself is up 27%. While the aim is to do better than that, it's worth recalling that even great long-term investments sometimes underperform for a year or more. It's great to see a nice little 4.8% rebound in the last three months. This could just be a bounce because the selling was too aggressive, but fingers crossed it's the start of a new trend.
