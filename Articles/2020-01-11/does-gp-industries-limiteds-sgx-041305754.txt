For example, I often monitor director buying and selling.How Growth Rates Impact P/E RatiosProbably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.GP Industries's earnings made like a rocket, taking off 118% last year. And earnings per share have improved by 50% annually, over the last three years. So we'd absolutely expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio.Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance SheetDon't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.While growth expenditure doesn't always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.How Does GP Industries's Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?GP Industries has net debt worth 100% of its market capitalization.
