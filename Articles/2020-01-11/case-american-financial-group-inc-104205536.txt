(NYSE:AFG): Could It Be A Nice Addition To Your Dividend Portfolio?Simply Wall StSimply Wall St.January 10, 2020ReblogShareTweetShareView photosIs American Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:AFG) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.While American Financial Group's 3.0% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this. Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on American Financial Group! NYSE:AFG Historical Dividend Yield, January 10th 2020MorePayout ratiosDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, American Financial Group paid out 22% of its profit as dividends. We like this low payout ratio, because it implies the dividend is well covered and leaves ample opportunity for reinvestment.We update our data on American Financial Group every 24 hours, so you can always get
our latest analysis of its financial health, here.Dividend VolatilityBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of American Financial Group's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.52 in 2010, compared to US$3.30 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 20% per year over this time.Dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.Dividend Growth PotentialDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. American Financial Group has grown its earnings per share at 6.8% per annum over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for American Financial Group's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.ConclusionTo summarise, shareholders should always check that American Financial Group's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. We're glad to see American Financial Group has a low payout ratio, as this suggests earnings are being reinvested in the business. Second, earnings growth has been mediocre, but at least the dividends have been relatively stable. American Financial Group has a number of positive attributes, but falls short of our ideal dividend company. It may be worth a look at the right price, though.Story continuesCompanies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.
