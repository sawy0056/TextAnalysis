Customers may elect to claim an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) of 30% in lieu of the PTC. The President signed into law the "Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019," H.R. 3301, Friday, December 20, 2019, as part of the bi-partisan FY2020 appropriations package. This package also continues funding for several programs, including the Department of Energy's Combined Heat and Power Technical Assistance Partnerships and Advanced Manufacturing Office R&D funding and EPA's CHP Partnership and Natural GasSTAR programs, and extends other incentives for energy production and efficiency.The reinstated PTC/ITC will allow businesses to claim a credit for qualified renewable energy projects, including purchases of Capstone's ultra-low emission and highly reliable microturbine technology for use in digester or landfill gas applications.Capstone personnel and associates worked diligently in partnership with the American Biogas Council (ABC), the CHP Alliance, the Clean Energy Business Network, and other industry partners to push for the reinstatement of this credit for customers in the renewable energy sector and continued support for CHP R&D and deployment."We believe that the reinstatement of the tax credit will help businesses lower their energy costs in the new green economy," stated Darren Jamison, President and CEO of Capstone Turbine Corporation. "Maintaining support for market education programs that reduce barriers to CHP deployment and voluntary industry programs to support energy efficiency, emissions reductions, and clean air helps to preserve access to a diverse portfolio of energy resources," added Mr. Jamison.Capstone Turbine's innovative microturbine technology has the ability to operate on biogas and other renewable fuels and produce clean and efficient electricity and thermal energy. Capstone microturbines are designed to help end-users improve their environmental impact while meeting critical power and reliability requirements. The reinstatement of the PTC for projects using these fuels will support the global push for decarbonization."We applaud these tools that help develop and sustain innovative clean energy solutions and cleaner, safer sources of energy," stated Jen Derstine, Capstone's Vice President of Marketing and Distribution.About Capstone Turbine CorporationCapstone Turbine Corporation (www.capstoneturbine.com) (CPST) is the world's leading producer of highly efficient, low-emission, resilient microturbine energy systems.
