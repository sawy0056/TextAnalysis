Super-resolution imaging (SRI), which is also known as nanoscopy or super-resolution microscopy, is a group of technologies that allow performing optical imaging beyond the diffraction limit of light. Light consists of electromagnetic radiations with wavelike characteristics. When light passes through a small opening or meets a small obstacle, it does not continue in a straight path, but it bends. This phenomenon is known as diffraction.Image resolution measures the number of details in an image. The resolution of optical instruments, such as microscopes and telescopes, is affected by diffraction. The diffraction limit is the minimum distance between two objects that permits to differentiate the objects one from the other.This report includes:An overview of the super-resolution imaging technologies in life science sector to evaluate cells at the nanoscale levelQuantitative analysis of the market outlook for super-resolution imaging systemsDiscussion of various types of super-resolution imaging systems, configuration of these systems, their applications in biophysical investigations, and recent technological achievementsCurrent technology assessment as well as outlining trends that are expected to contribute to market growth for these imaging technologiesComparison between three pre-eminent kinds of super-resolution microscopy technologies, such as stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM)Discovering the advantages and challenges in using these techniques together; along with current and emerging trends for improving super-resolution imaging systemsKey Topics Covered: Technology Highlights and Market OutlookSuper-resolution ImagingApplications of Super-resolution Imaging in the Life SciencesTypes of Super-resolution Imaging SystemsFluorescence and Epifluorescence MicroscopesSuper-resolution Imaging SystemsMajor IssuesCurrent and Emerging TrendsAdvanced Multicolor SystemsResolution EnhancementImage Quality ImprovementsFaster and High-Throughput SystemsRecent Achievements in the Life Sciences due to Super-resolution ImagingMarket Outlook for Super-resolution Imaging Systems in the Life SciencesAnalyst CredentialsList of TablesTable 1: Applications of Super-resolution Imaging in the Life SciencesTable 2: Common Types of Super-resolution Imaging SystemsTable 3: Current and Emerging Trends in Super-resolution Imaging TechnologyTable 4: Global Market for Super-resolution Imaging Systems in the Life Sciences, by Type of System, Through 2024Table 5: Global Market for Super-resolution Imaging Systems in the Life Sciences, by Region/Country, Through 2024List of FiguresFigure 1: Global Market Shares of Super-resolution Imaging Systems in the Life Sciences, by Type of System, 2024Figure 2: Global Market Shares of Super-resolution Imaging Systems in the Life Sciences, by Region/Country, 2024For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/l7ry23About ResearchAndMarkets.com ResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.
