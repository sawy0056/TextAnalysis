But the next day, my phone blew up. I took his (Samjiskar’s) permission and began sharing his number with those who reached out.”By the third day, he’d been retweeted almost 6,000 times, with 12,000 likes. “I don’t think Facebook or WhatsApp would’ve had the same effect because the networks are among friends,” said George. “Because it was on Twitter, it took off and went viral.”George wasn’t the only one eager to help. It turned out that a day before meeting George, Samjiskar had shared his card with George’s friend, too.
