Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (“Roche”) to utilize Amunix’s technology platform, XTEN, to discover and develop non-oncology therapeutics against certain undisclosed targets. This agreement builds on Amunix’s previous technology assessment with Roche focused on using XTEN, a proprietary unstructured polypeptide, to extend drug half-life.“We are pleased to license our technology to Roche to support the discovery and development of novel therapeutics to address high unmet needs across various diseases,” said Angie You, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Amunix. “This agreement further validates our foundational XTEN technology and its continued potential for biopharmaceutical partners seeking to develop drugs with augmented half-life and low associated immunogenicity.”Under the terms of the agreement, Amunix will receive a $40 million upfront payment from Roche. Amunix may also receive up to $1.5 billion in payments from Roche associated with the achievement of certain developmental and sales milestones, plus royalties on sales of commercialized products.Dr. You continued, “As we continue to pivot from purely a technology licensing company to a cancer drug discovery and development organization, we look forward to Roche and other external collaborators continuing to utilize our XTEN technology for a spectrum of indications while we focus our internal efforts on repurposing this technology to build a pro-drug platform and advance an oncology pipeline.” About Amunix Pharmaceuticals Amunix Pharmaceuticals, based in Mountain View, CA, is leveraging over a decade of expertise in precision protein engineering to enable the promise of T cell engagers and cytokines to treat patients with solid tumors.
