This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK).Our data shows Deckers Outdoor has a return on equity of 30% for the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, it generated $0.30 in profit. See our latest analysis for Deckers Outdoor How Do I Calculate ROE?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquityOr for Deckers Outdoor:30% = US$279m ÷ US$916m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is all earnings retained by the company, plus any capital paid in by shareholders. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.What Does ROE Signify?ROE measures a company's profitability against the profit it retains, and any outside investments. The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that the higher the ROE, the more profitable the company is. So, as a general rule, a high ROE is a good thing. Clearly, then, one can use ROE to compare different companies.Does Deckers Outdoor Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Deckers Outdoor has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the Luxury industry.NYSE:DECK Past Revenue and Net Income, January 10th 2020MoreThat's what I like to see. We think a high ROE, alone, is usually enough to justify further research into a company. For example you might check if insiders are buying shares.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining Deckers Outdoor's Debt And Its 30% Return On EquityWhile Deckers Outdoor does have a tiny amount of debt, with debt to equity of just 0.048, we think the use of debt is very modest. When I see a high ROE, fuelled by only modest debt, I suspect the business is high quality. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality.The Bottom Line On ROEReturn on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. In my book the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Story continuesOf course Deckers Outdoor may not be the best stock to buy.
