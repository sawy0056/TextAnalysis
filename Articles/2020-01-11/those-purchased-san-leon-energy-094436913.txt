But unfortunately, some companies simply don't succeed. For example the San Leon Energy plc (LON:SLE) share price dropped 70% over five years. That's an unpleasant experience for long term holders. See our latest analysis for San Leon Energy We don't think San Leon Energy's revenue of US$243,859 is enough to establish significant demand. We can't help wondering why it's publicly listed so early in its journey. Are venture capitalists not interested? So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. For example, they may be hoping that San Leon Energy finds fossil fuels with an exploration program, before it runs out of money.We think companies that have neither significant revenues nor profits are pretty high risk. There is almost always a chance they will need to raise more capital, and their progress - and share price - will dictate how dilutive that is to current holders. While some companies like this go on to deliver on their plan, making good money for shareholders, many end in painful losses and eventual de-listing. San Leon Energy has already given some investors a taste of the bitter losses that high risk investing can cause.San Leon Energy had cash in excess of all liabilities of US$56m when it last reported (June 2019). That's not too bad but management may have to think about raising capital or taking on debt, unless the company is close to breaking even. With the share price down 21% per year, over 5 years , it seems likely that the need for cash is weighing on investors' minds.

What if insiders are ditching the stock hand over fist? I would feel more nervous about the company if that were so. It only takes a moment for you to check whether we have identified any insider sales recently.A Different PerspectiveSan Leon Energy shareholders are up 0.7% for the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 21% endured over half a decade.
