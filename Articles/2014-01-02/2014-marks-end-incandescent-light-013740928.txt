The era of incandescent light bulbs has come to an end in 2014.USA Today reports:Starting Jan. 1, the United States will no longer manufacture or import incandescent bulbs – although stores can still sell what they have in stock. The phaseout is a result of federal rules to switch to more energy-efficient bulbs.While the newest bulbs give consumers a much longer-lasting light and use a lot less electricity, some people seem reluctant to switch. One reason may be the higher cost of the new bulbs. CFLs cost a few dollars, and LED bulbs may cost $10 or $20, while incandescent bulbs are only about 70 cents, USA Today says.While the new bulbs will lower a family’s spending on electricity, it’s not by a huge amount because the average household doesn’t spend a lot on lighting. Reports USA Today:Home improvement store Lowe’s did a study comparing electricity costs of an LED vs. an incandescent bulb. Energy costs for the LED added up to $30 over the bulb’s 22-year lifespan. Energy costs for using an incandescent bulb over that same period added up to $165 – savings, certainly, but perhaps not significant enough for many homeowners over two decades to alter their buying habitsOf course, once the selection of incandescent bulbs runs out, you’ll have no choice but to go with the energy-efficient bulbs.
