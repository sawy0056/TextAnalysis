Fiat announced an agreement with the VEBA Trust, under which its wholly owned subsidiary, Fiat North America, will acquire all of the VEBA Trust¡¦s equity membership interests in Chrysler Group, representing the 41.4616% of Chrysler Group not currently held by FNA. The transaction is expected to close on or before January 20. In consideration for the sale of its membership interests in Chrysler Group, the VEBA Trust will receive aggregate consideration of $3,65B consisting of: „h a special distribution payable by Chrysler Group to its members, in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.9B ; and at closing, FNA will pay the remainder of approximately $1,75B in cash purchase consideration to the VEBA Trust. Fiat expects to fund the $1.75B in cash from available cash on hand. Chrysler Group expects to fund the special distribution from available cash on hand. As part of the transactions, FNA and the VEBA Trust will agree to dismiss with prejudice the current proceedings before the Delaware Court of Chancery with respect to the interpretation of the call option agreement pursuant to which Fiat has, through FNA, exercised three tranches of a call option to acquire membership interests in Chrysler Group held by the VEBA Trust. All of these membership interests will be acquired by FNA. Given the funding arrangements for the transaction, it is not envisioned that Fiat will require equity capital to be raised via a rights issue.
