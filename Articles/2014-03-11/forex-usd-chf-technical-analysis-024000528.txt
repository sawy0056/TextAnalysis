Support: 0.8776-50 (Feb 28 low, 38.2% Fib exp.), 0.8705 (50% Fib exp.)
Resistance: 0.8855 (trend line) The US Dollar may be preparing to launch a recovery against the Swiss Franc as prices show a Doji candle at support marked by the February 28 low at 0.8776. This barrier is reinforced by the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion at 0.8750. Positive RSI divergence bolsters the case for an upside scenario. A bounce sees near-term resistance is at a falling trend line set from late January, now at 0.8855. Alternatively, a break below 0.8750 eyes the 50% level at 0.8705.A Doji candle on its own points to indecision but falls short of offering a concrete upward reversal signal. With that in mind, we will stand side for now until an actionable setup presents.Confirm your chart-based trade setups with the Technical Analyzer. New to FX?
