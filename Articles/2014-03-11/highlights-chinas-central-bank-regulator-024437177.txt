Personally, I think it's very likely to be realised within one or two years."There are market forces pushing forward interest-rate liberalisation, and various types of emerging businesses have promoted interest-rate liberalisation."When the market looks for high-return opportunities, interest rates might go upward within a certain range. But finally, the interest rates will be decided by a balance in supply and demand."Generally speaking, to realise the internationalisation of the renminbi, or to push forward renminbi usage in trade and investment settlements, is a relatively long process."(Reporting By China Economics Team)
