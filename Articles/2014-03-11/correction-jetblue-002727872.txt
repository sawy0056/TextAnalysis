NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - March 10, 2014) - In the news release, "JetBlue Launches 52nd Non-Stop Route out of Boston, Service to Detroit Begins," issued earlier today by JetBlue (JBLU), we are advised by the company that the headline should read, "JetBlue Launches 51st Non-Stop Route out of Boston, Service to Detroit Begins," as it is the 51st nonstop route from Boston Logan Airport, not the 52nd. Complete corrected text follows.JetBlue Launches 51st Non-Stop Route out of Boston, Service to Detroit BeginsCelebratory Fares Available Today and Tomorrow Only, Starting at $79 One Way for Travel March 18 - May 22, 2014 (a)NEW YORK, NY -- March 10, 2014 -- JetBlue Airways (JBLU) today added Detroit Metro Airport to its growing route network. The airline now offers 51 non-stop routes and up to 128 daily departures out of Boston Logan International Airport, where JetBlue is the largest carrier. To celebrate the new route, which will be operated three times daily, flights between Boston and Detroit are on sale starting at $79 one way (a) for travel on Mondays - Thursdays and Saturdays between March 18 and May 22, 2014 (blackout dates April 10 to April 28, 2014,). Tickets must be purchased by midnight tomorrow, March 11. 7-day advance purchase required."Today we strengthen our offering from Boston, while also bringing our low fares and award-winning service to Detroit and one of the most overpriced markets in the U.S.," said Dave Barger, JetBlue's CEO. "Detroit is also home to the largest Arab community in America and we are excited that our code-share partner Emirates today launches its Boston-Dubai service, which will provide our customers with seamless connections to and from Detroit. This route will also connect well with Turkish Airlines, when their Boston-Istanbul service begins on May 12."Detroit has for years been a high-fare market, which JetBlue's entry will hopefully change. JetBlue has also been cited by an independent study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as the low-cost carrier that lowered fares the most when it began service in a new U.S. market in 2012. The JetBlue Effect, MIT says, lowered fares $32 one way on average (b).JetBlue's schedule between Boston (BOS) and Detroit (DTW), effective March 10, 2014:
