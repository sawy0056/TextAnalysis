VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Mar 10, 2014) -
Fortress Paper Ltd. ("Fortress Paper" or the "Company") (FTP.TO) reported 2013 fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $9.4 million. The Dissolving Pulp Segment generated EBITDA loss of $10.8 million and the Security Paper Products Segment generated EBITDA of $2.7 million. Corporate costs contributed $1.3 million to EBITDA loss.Chadwick Wasilenkoff, Chief Executive Officer of Fortress Paper, commented: "The 2013 year proved to be very challenging for Fortress Paper. Positive developments throughout the year were overshadowed by the disappointing financial results from the Dissolving Pulp Segment. As we enter 2014, we believe that we are making progress on numerous initiatives and are confident that we are on the right track to overcome remaining obstacles. I would like to thank the entire team at Fortress Paper for their perseverance and commitment throughout a difficult year."Early in the fourth quarter of 2013, the Fortress Specialty Cellulose mill reached a significant milestone for the reduction of the overall cost structure at the mill when the cogeneration facility project was successfully completed and delivering power to the Hydro Québec grid at the contracted commercial rate. Also, the Fortress Specialty Cellulose mill realized its swing mill capabilities producing 12,889 air dried metric tonnes (ADMT) of northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) pulp early in the quarter. The mill sold 6,758 ADMT of NBHK pulp inventory in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 6,950 ADMT of NBHK pulp inventory subsequent to December 31, 2013. Despite these developments, the results for the Dissolving Pulp Segment reflect a combination of the following:A seven day planned maintenance shut-down in October. A 13% interim duty imposed by China's Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM") on the import of dissolving pulp into China from the Fortress Specialty Cellulose mill (Thurso) and possibly a 50.9% interim duty on the import of dissolving pulp into China from future output from the Fortress Global Cellulose mill (Lebel-sur-Quevillon) if it were to be converted to be able to produce dissolving pulp. As a result of the 50.9% MOFCOM interim duty imposed on the import of future dissolving pulp into China, a $32.9 million impairment was taken against the Fortress Global Cellulose mill assets. The duty imposed also resulted in a build-up of dissolving pulp inventories and consequent $3.7 million write-down to fair market value. A decision to take market downtime in mid-December for approximately 10 weeks as a result of market pricing for NBHK being insufficient for sustained production. A five day shut-down in early December as a result of a digester issue, which has since been resolved. The Security Paper Products Segment experienced a second consecutive EBITDA positive quarter. Sales, volumes and revenues were significantly higher relative to any quarter in 2012 and 2011. The Landqart mill continues to implement new initiatives to improve efficiencies and profitability.Selected Financial Information The selected financial information presented herein is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company's audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2013 and the related notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis (the "MD&A"), which are available on SEDAR.Reference is made in this news release to EBITDA (defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-operating income and expenses and stock-based compensation), which the Company considers to be an indicative measure of operating performance and a metric to evaluate profitability.

The CompanyDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company operated internationally in three distinct business segments: the Dissolving Pulp Segment, the Security Paper Products Segment, and the Specialty Papers Segment. The Specialty Papers Segment was sold on April 30, 2013 leaving two remaining business segments. Accordingly, references in this news release to "discontinued operations" refer to the Specialty Papers Segment.The Company operates its dissolving pulp business through the Fortress Specialty Cellulose mill located in Thurso, Québec, Canada, which has expanded into the renewable energy generation sector with the construction of a cogeneration facility and the production of NBHK pulp. The Company is also evaluating expanding its dissolving pulp capacity by converting the Fortress Global Cellulose mill located at Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Québec into a dissolving pulp mill and re-starting the cogeneration facility. The Company operates its security paper products business at the Landqart mill located in Switzerland, where it produces banknote, passport, visa and other brand protection and security papers, and at its high security production and research facility located in Canada, where it manufactures optically variable thin film material. The segmentation of the Company's manufacturing operations is based on a number of factors, including production, production processes, and economic characteristics. Fortress Paper's business segments were re-classified in 2012 given changes in the nature of products being produced.Story continuesConference CallA conference call to discuss the financial results for the fourth quarter 2013 will be held on March 11, 2014 at 9:00 a.m. (PDT).
